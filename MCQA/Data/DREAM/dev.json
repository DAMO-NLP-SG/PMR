      "W: Then when did his movie career really start?",
      "M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society.",

      "Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away.",
      "Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know?",
      "Caller: First of all, how big is it?",
      "Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer.",
      "Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex?",
      "Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure.",
      "Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all?",
      "Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.",
      "Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent?",
      "Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month.",
      "Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me.",
      "Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate.",
      "Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities?",
      "Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door.",
      "Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?",
      "Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit.",
      "Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit?",
      "Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of.",
      "Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in.",
      "Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back.",
      "Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus?",
      "Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front.",
      "Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy?",
      "Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine.",
      "Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants?",
      "Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year.",
      "Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning?",
      "Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then.",
      "Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located?",
      "Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant.",
      "Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed?",
      "Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that.",
      "Caller: Um, I have a rat ...",
      "Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you?",
      "Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay?",

E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress.",

Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who's known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight.

It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film about himself as well."

They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month.
