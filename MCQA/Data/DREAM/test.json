      "M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.",
      "W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?",
      "M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.",
      "W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?",
      "M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect."

Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.",

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?",
      "Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.",
      "dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?",
      "Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.",
      "Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.",
      "Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.",
      "Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?",
      "Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...",
      "Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.",
      "Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.",
      "Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.",
      "greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...",
      "Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?",
      "Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.",
      "Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.",
      "Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.",
      "Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?",
      "Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.",
      "Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?",
      "baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...",
      "Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.",
      "Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.",
      "Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?",
      "Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.",
      "Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].",
      "Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?",
      "Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.",
      "Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.",

      "M: Mm...",
      "W: It seems so completely short-sighted to me. Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.",

      "W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.",
      "M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.",
      "W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.",
      "M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.",
      "W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land. I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more. I mean it could be used for farming for instance.",
      "M: True.",
      "W: It could also be used for housing, or it could be used for parks, you know. People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far.",
      "M: But, airports do bring some local advantages. They bring roads, there is obviously extra employment, for instance, new hotels, shops, restaurants will have to be built. This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy.",
      "W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it?",
      "M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right?",
      "W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right?",
      "M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important. And this means travel, and means quick travel, air travel. And we just need a new airport."

Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before."

      "F: Incredible!",

      "F: And how does it work?",

      "F: Is there a headphone?",

      "M: Yes, it does.",
      "F: Any other Japanese models?",

      "F: I see.",
      "M: And, according to a spokesman, they hope to match their calculator sales, which are about 25 million units per year.",
      "F: Very impressive. And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon.",
      "M: Most likely.",
      "F: Now, could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs?",
      "M: Of course. From Sinclair in England there's one similar in size to the Casio, and their production levels were 1 million for 1983.",

Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say \"oh, here are my goals\" and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way. They stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them."
