      "It's cool, and it's hot, and everyone is doing it. People talk about it often, and friends tell other friends how good they look. Sound like a fashion? It's actually another trend : \"blog\". What's a blog? A blog is a personal online diary. The word \"blogger\" means a person who writes diaries online.\nMany bloggers are teens who've been logging  onto sites to discuss anything in their lives. Many of today's teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teens complain  about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems, say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day.\nHowever, many parents are afraid of these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don't like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get message from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. \"These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words, \" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two.\nMany teens and young adults know it's not safe to use blogs on the Internet. They know they are putting information about themselves in a place they can be seen by anyone. But teens are unlikely to give up these new communication tools that have becomes a way of life for many of them.\nAre you a bloggers? What do you think of the blog?"

      "A  At a recent visit to the beautiful Keukenhof flower gardens in Holland, I learned about the practice of topping.As flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.The expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers.\nThis is the same with personal growth.Sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.This can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results.\nAfter running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, I decided to drop it and leave that field behind.This freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.If I'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path.\nIt can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its place.\nDo you want to settle where you are right now? If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.\nStepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path."

      "If you win the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot  , you may not be as lucky as you think. Many winners experience the so-called curse of the lottery, with some squandering their fortunes and others meeting tragic ends.\n\"So many of them wind up unhappy or wind up broke. People have had terrible things happen,\" said Don McNay, 56, a financial consultant to lottery winners and the author of Life Lessons from the Lottery. \"People commit suicide. People run through their money. Easy comes, easy goes. They go through divorce or people die.\"\n\"It's just a great change that they're not ready for,\" McNay told Time on Tuesday. \"It's the curse of the lottery because it made their lives worse instead of improving them.\"\nAbout 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education. Here are some of the stories of past winners that gamblers should know about:\nAbraham Shakespeare was murdered in 2009 after he won a $30 million lottery jackpot. The 47-year-old Florida man was shot twice in the chest and then buried under a slab of concrete in a backyard, ABC News reported. Dorris \"Dee Dee\" Moore, who authorities say befriended him after his lottery win, was found guilty of first degree murder in 2012. His brother, Robert Brown, told the BBC that Shakespeare always said he regretted winning the lottery. \"'I'd have been better off going broke.' He said that to me all the time,\" Brown said."

      "Summer in Europe is very nice for us to visit one of our favourite cities for a break. Below we have put together a short list of our favourite summer break locations  that offer a great balance of culture, sunshine and fun.\nBerlin, the second most populous city in the European Union, gets the third place on our list. It has three famous airports: Tegel International Airport, Tempelhof International Airport, and Schonefeld International Airport.\nThe capital of Germany is on this list not only because it is a fantastic place to go on holiday but also since it teaches a very important lesson to humanity(,). The Berlin Wall, the better part of which still remains well kept for educational and amusement  aims, reminds us of the extra costs paid by everyone. Today, the undamaged part of the Wall, known as the East Side Gallery, shows striking murals ;if you are interested in this chapter  of the city's history, there is also a Berlin Wall Memorial you would want to visit. The Potsdamer Platz, divided into two by the Wall, is a newly developed area that is famous for a large shopping center and movie theatre complexes , and adds a bit of modern colour to Berlin's historical value.\nMuch like the other places that made the list, Berlin is also a city of art. The city has over one hundred and fifty museums in all, and a few of the ones providing an extraordinary experience include the Art Center Berlin Friedrichstrabe, the Museum of Indian Art, and the Museum of East Asian Art. Appreciating Berlin's art is much like taking a university course in itself and it can only be truly appreciated in several trips."

      "As teachers, most of us have been taught that tests are the best way to assess our students' learning and the effectiveness of our teaching. But when a student scores poorly on a test, how does he or she benefit? The student loses confidence and ends up feeling \"stupid\". I believe we can use tests to improve learning, not just check what our students have memorized. \nI recently attended a conference where the speaker, Thomas Guskey, challenged us to consider how we might change the culture of classroom testing. Guskey asked, \"What happens to these tests? What educational purpose do they serve?\" His point was that teachers typically grade test papers, give them back, and then move on. Students put their test papers away and never look at them again. Some students will even make a show of walking leisurely to the trash to crumple and toss their test papers into the bin. If a student feels like he or she studied hard for a test and still got a bad grade, he or she can become disheartened with the classroom cycle that consists of teaching and testing, teaching and testing. \nMany times, testing simply feels like a winning or losing game between students and their teachers. I'll never forget the day my son and I were discussing testing in one of his least favorite classes (and with his least favorite teacher) and he looked me square in the eyes and said, \"Mom, I refuse to play the game.\" My son was in honors classes, yet he felt this way! Would it be regarded as less of a game if students had a chance to retake the test, or work out where they'd gone wrong?\nThere is an argument for the exam as the final assessment: if students don't have the knowledge by the time they're tested, that's unfortunate, but it's time to move on -- there's only so much time to teach the material. \"What about surgeons  ? Do they 'test' their learning on a genuine patient?\" Guskey asked. \"Or do they get to check their learning on a dead body to make sure they've got it worked out?\" You wouldn't show a surgeon a heart bypass in a textbook and then send him or her straight into the operating room!\nBy moving on immediately after giving an exam, we're missing a valuable opportunity to teach our students exactly what they need to learn! Rather than a game in which students either win or lose, we can turn testing into a win-win classroom experience by giving students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. We can change the culture in our classrooms by using tests as a tool to improve learning rather than marking the end of the learning process."

      "I like watching butterflies. Sometimes I think I'm the only girl who notices these quiet but beautiful things. But if it hadn't been for a crowded restaurant, I wouldn't have ever noticed Valeri.\nValeri was a new student. She walked to class with her books against her chest and her head down. She talked only when the teacher asked her a question. After a month at our school, she hadn't made any friend.\nOne day at lunch, most tables being full, I had nowhere to sit. Valeri sat alone, book in hand. I walked over to her, \"Is that a good book?\" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading. \"What's it about?\" I asked. After seconds of silence, she looked at me, her eyes shining, \"Well, it's about a dragon! This boy, Eragon, finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day. He thinks it's a rock! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big .\"\nTwo weeks later, I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show. Then a shy girl walked on stage. I recognized her immediately. Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other. She started to play. The notes formed a soft, sweet tune . The auditorium fell completely silent until we realized the music was finished. I smiled to myself. Valeri wasn't just \"a quiet girl\". She knew about wonderful books and could play the violin like nothing I'd ever heard. Like a butterfly, she was beautiful and amazing when you looked closely."

      "The meaning of silence varies among cultural groups. Silences may be thoughtful, or they may be empty when a person has nothing to say. A silence in a conversation may also show stubbornness, or worry. Silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable; therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap with conversation. Persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding a person's needs. &\nMany Native Americans value silence and feel it is a basic part of communicating among people, just as some traditional Chinese and Thai persons do. Therefore, when a person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops, what maybe implied  is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing. In these cultures, silence is a call for reflection.\nOther cultures may use silence in other ways, particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power. For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority.\nNurses and other care-geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing. Nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that a patient's silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily. A nurse who understands the healing  value of silence can use this understanding to assist in the care of patients from their own and from other cultures."

      "Do you like going to a theater to watch live performances? If you do, I'm not alone.\nLive performances at theaters interest different groups of people from rich people to office workers. If you go to any theater and look at its audience, you will find it is made up of teenagers, the elderly and anyone in between. One part of it is due to the marketing and the show itself. For example, Hair isn't going to interest the same audience as My Fair Lady. Another part of it is due to the area in which you live. The Palace Theater in Manchester, for example, interests a more urban  crowd than the Leddy Center in Epping. All of these people have an interest in the magic of live performances and they go to the theater for different reasons.\nThere is nothing better than live theatre performances to increase your cultural awareness   When you go to see a live theater performance, no matter whether it is a musical or a play, you are improving your knowledge of the world around you. Some people go to the theater to have fun and escape their troubles; others, particularly rich people, go to the theater to develop their knowledge of the world around them. Both of them are very good reasons for going to see live theater performances. However, personally, I often go to the theater more to have fun than anything else.\nEveryone has the right to enjoy any performance, whether it's a world-famous performance by the New Hampshire Ballet or a second-rate performance by your local community theater. The main thing to remember is whether you are there to heighten your awareness of the culture or to get away from your problems. You should appreciate the performance for what it is, because too many people these days don't know enough about the arts."

Finally Joan seems to be better than her elder sister--and Sally doesn't like it! Their distance may be temporary, but it shows that childhood competition don't fade easily as ages grow. It can remain powerful in relationships throughout life.\nIn a study of the University of Cincinnati, 65 men and women between ages 25 and 93 were asked how they felt about their brothers and sisters. Nearly 75 percent admitted having hidden competitive feelings. In a few cases, these emotions were so strong as to have affected their entire lives.\nMany adult brothers and sisters are close, supportive--yet still tend to compete. Two brothers I know turn into killers when on opposite sides of a tennis net. Off the court, they are the best of friends. My own younger sister can't wait to tell me when I've put on weight. However, she's a terrible cook and that pleases me; I tease her when she comes to dinner. Happily, despite these small failings, we have been an important resource for each other.\nIn between the very competitive and the generally supportive children lie those who say that no friendship should survive. _ . Why do these puzzling, unproductive, often painful relationships continue to exist?"

      "We know the famous ones--the Thomas Edisons and the Alexander Graham Bells--but what about the less famous inventors? What about the people who invented the traffic light and the windshield wiper ? Shouldn't we know who they are?\nJoan Mclean thinks so.In fact,Mclean,a professor of physics at Mountain University in Range,feels so strongly about this matter that she's developed a course on the topic.In addition to learning\"who\"invented\"what\",however,Mclean also likes her students to learn the answers to the\"why''and''how\"questions.According to Mclean.\"When students learn the answers to these questions,they are better prepared to recognize opportunities for inventing and more motivated to give inventing a try.''\nHer students agree.One young man with a patent for an unbreakable umbrella is walking  proof of McLean's statement.\"If I had not heard the story of the windshield wiper's  invention,\"said Tommy Lee, a senior physics major,\"I never would have dreamed of turning  my bad experience during a rainstorm into something so constructive.\"Lee is currently  negotiating to sell his patent to an umbrella producer.\nSo,just what is the story behind the windshield wiper Well,Mary Anderson came up  with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City.The day was cold and stormy,but  Anderson still wanted to see the sights,so she jumped aboard a streetcar.Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield,she found herself wondering why there couldn't be a built--in device for cleaning the window.Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham,Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions.One of her ideas,a lever on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside,became the first windshield wiper.\nToday we benefit from countless inventions and innovations.It's hard to imagine driving  without Garrett A.Morgan's traffic light.It's equally impossible to picture a world without  Katherine J.Blodgett's innovation that makes glass invisible.Can you picture life without  clear windows and eyeglasses?"

      "Most musicians agree that the best violins were made in Cremona, Italy, about 200 years ago. They even sound better than violins made today. Violin makers and scientists try to make instruments like the old Italian violins. But they aren't the same. Why are these old Italian violins so special? Many people think they have an answer.\nSome people think it is the age of the violins. But there is a problem here. Not all old violins sound wonderful. Only those from Cremona are special. So age cannot be the answer.\nOther people think the secret to those violins is the wood. The wood of the violin is very important. It must be from certain kinds of trees. It must not be too young or too old. Perhaps the violin makers of Cremona knew something special about wood for violins.\nBut the kind of wood may not be so important. It may be more important to cut the wood in a special way. Wood for a violin must be cut very carefully. It has to be the right size and shape. The smallest difference will change the sound of the violin. Musicians sometimes think that this is the secret of the Italians.\nSize and shape may not be the answer either. Scientists make new violins that are exactly the same size and shape. But the new violins still do not sound as good as the old one. Some scientists think the secret may be the varnish , which covers the wood of the violin and makes it look shiny. It also helps the sound of the instrument. Since no one knows what the Italian violin makers used in their varnish, no one can make the same varnish today.\nThere may never be other violins like the violins of Cremona. And there are not many of the old violins left. So these old violins are becoming more and more precious."

      "The Leaning Tower of Pisa was straight like a pole when the construction began in 1173. It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed. The tower was reopened for the general public on December 15, 2001.\nIn May 2008, after removing another 70 metric tons of earth, the engineers announced that the tower had been finally stabilized and it would remain stable for at least 200 years."

      "Experts have suggested various tools for reducing carbon emissions  . But some young people in China have another solution:  turn off your personal computer for the weekend and get away from the Internet.\nThe suggestion comes from a group of websites in China behind what they call \"NC63 \". The name is short for \"No Computer 63 Hours\", which means that people should shut down their personal computers (PCs) at 6 p. m. on Friday and not start them up again until 9 a. m. on Monday. You can read about the movement on their website (http:// www. nc63. org/) in Chinese -- but only on weekdays .\nThe NC63 hopes to call everyone to take real action to support a low-carbon, green life, to support environmental protection, and to choose and support the earth, by turning off the computer for the weekend.  White-collar workers are advised not to use the computer too much. The organizers hope they can get websites and PC makers to carry warning labels  , like cigarettes, saying something like \"Too much internet surfing is harmful to health.\"\\\nShutdown Day is once a year, though.  NC63 is every weekend.\nThe group' s first official event, took place on Nov. 29,ahead of the Copenhagen talks. About 100 volunteers gathered at Sanlitun Village, an shopping area in Beijing. They came to Starbucks and other cafes and restaurants to find those using laptops to surf the Internet. People caught using laptops were handed \"tickets\" ( actually small leaflets (  ) explaining NC63' s philosophy ).\nNC63 has a point about PC use. While PC use isn' t generally regarded as a primary contributor ( ) to China' s carbon emissions -- the biggest in the world, some global warming activists argue that it makes a big difference. One U. S. group estimates that a typical desktop PC with a 17-inch monitor could, if left on all day ever)' day for a year, give off over 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."

      "Cultural Center Adds Classes for Young Adults\nThe Allendale Cultural Center has expanded its arts program to include classes for young adults. Director Leah Martin announced Monday that beginning in September, three new classes will be offered to the Allendale community. The course titles will be Yoga for Teenagers; Hip Hop Dance: Learning the Latest Moves; and Creative Journaling for Teens: Discovering the Writer Within. The latter course will not be held at the Allendale Cultural Center but instead will meet at the Allendale Public Library.\nStaff member Tricia Cousins will teach the yoga and hip hop classes. Ms. Cousins is an accomplished choreographer   as well as an experienced dance educator. She has an MA in dance education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where she wrote a thesis on the pedagogical   effectiveness of dance education. The journaling class will be taught by Betsy Milford. Ms. Milford is the head librarian at the Allendale Public Library as well as a columnist for the professional journal Library Focus.\nThe courses are part of the Allendale Cultural Center's Project Teen, which was initiated by Leah Martin, Director of the Cultural Center. According to Martin, this project is a direct result of her efforts to make the center a more essential part of the Allendale community. Over the last several years, the number of people who have visited the cultural center for classes or events has steadily declined. Project Teen is primarily funded by a generous grant from The McGee Arts Foundation, an organization devoted to bringing arts programs to young adults. Martin oversees the Project Teen board, which consists of five board members. Two board members are students at Allendale's Brookdale High School; the other three are adults with backgrounds in education and the arts.\nThe creative journaling class will be cosponsored by Brookdale High School, and students who complete the class will be given the opportunity to publish one of their journal entries in Pulse, Brookdale's student literary magazine. Students who complete the hip hop class will be eligible to participate in the Allendale Review, an annual concert sponsored by the cultural center that features local actors, musicians, and dancers. All classes are scheduled to begin immediately following school dismissal, and transportation will be available from Brookdale High School to the Allendale Cultural Center and the Allendale Public Library. For more information about Project Teen, contact the cultural center's programming office at 988-0099 or drop by the office after June 1 to pick up a fall course catalog. The office is located on the third floor of the Allendale Town Hall."

      "Although the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have English as an official language, the United States does not have an official language. This is why it's possible to become a US citizen without speaking English. Canada also has French as an official language, though it is mostly spoken in the province of Quebec. Because many of the English speakers who originally lived in Canada came from the US, there is little difference in American and Canadian English. Similarly, Australian English and New Zealand English have few differences, except Australia was originally settled as a penal colony   and New Zealand was not. New Zealanders were more attached to the Received Pronunciation of the upper class in England, so their dialect is considered closer to British English.\nBritish colonialism   has spread English all over the world, and it is still popular in South Africa, India, and Singapore, among other nations. In South Africa, English became an official language, along with Afrikaans and 9 African languages, in the 1996 constitution. However, only 3% of the country's 30 million people are native English speakers. Twenty percent are descendants   of Dutch farmers who speak Afrikaans, and the rest are native Africans.\nIndia became independent from Britain in 1947. However, today English and Hindi are the official languages. Indian English is characterized by treating mass nouns as count nouns, frequent use of the \"isn't it?\" tag, use of more compounds, and a different use of prepositions. In Singapore, Chinese, Malay and Indian languages all influence the form of English spoken. Everyone is taught English in the school system, but there are a few differences from British English as well. Mass nouns are treated as count nouns, \"use to\" means usually, and no articles are used before occupations."

      "English teenagers are to receive compulsory cooking lessons in schools. The idea is to encourage healthy eating to fight the country's increasing obesity rate. It's feared that basic cooking and food preparation skills are being lost as parents turn to pre-pre-pared convenience foods.\nCooking was once regarded as an important part of education in England-even if it was mainly aimed at girls. In recent decades cooking has progressively become a minor activity in schools. In  many cases the schools themselves have given up cooking meals in kitchens in the schools .But the rising level of obesity has led to a rethink about the food that children are given and the skills they should be taught.\n\"What I want is to teach young people how to do basic, simple recipes like a tomato sauce, a bolognaise, a simple curry, a stir-fry-which they can use now at home and then in their later life\", said Ed Balls, the minister responsible for schools.\nThe new lessons are due to start in September, but some schools without kitchens will be given longer to adapt. There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking. Also the compulsory lessons for hands on cooking will only be one hour a week for one term. But the well-known cookery writer, Pru  Leith, believes it will be worth it .\n\"If we'd done this thirty years ago we might not have the crisis we've got now about obesity and lack of knowledge about food and so on. Every child should know how to cook, not just so that they'll be healthy, but because it's a life skill which is a real pleasure\".\nThe renewed interest in cooking is primarily a response to the level of obesity in Britain which is among the highest in Europe, and according to government figures half of all Britains will be obese in 25 years if current trends are not stopped."

      "BROOKSVILLE -- It's the time of year again, when young bears are on their own for the first time. And that means more sightings where bears usually aren't supposed to be.\nThis weekend, a 258-pound black bear took a brief tour of Brooksville, with police and firefighters chasing.\nAnother black bear, weighing just 100 pounds, was spotted Saturday, crossing busy U. S. 19 near a retirement community in Spring Hill. Several other bear reports have come from Citrus County.\n\" It is really difficult for the younger bears to find their own land around here, \" said Niki Everitt, bear hot line director for the Gulf Coast Conservancy.\nBrooksville's bear first was spotted late Thursday crossing State Road 50, headed toward Tom Varn Park. Police and firefighters tracked the bear through the park and the Brooksville Quarry golf course.\nThe bear then wounded down the middle of Broad Street before being surrounded near Luigi's Pizza. An official with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission came with a tranquilizer spear .planning to stick the bear by hand. \"The guy saw the size of the bear and figured that wasn't a great idea, \"said Capt. Frank Phillips of the Brooksville Fire Department.\nEmergency officials waited until a tranquilizer gun was brought from Land O' Lakes. The bear then got a free ride to the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Management Area.\nIt is not unusual for bears to move into living areas this time of year, experts say. Mothers give their male baby bears the boot once the youngsters are 2 years old. With living areas growing, the young bears keep finding smaller and smaller areas in which they can set up their own land.\n\"They' re trying to find a land of their own, where they won 't get beat up, \" said Lt. Rip Stalvey, a game commission spokesman.\nEveritt said people should not be too concerned about the recent bear sightings, since\" we have never had a bear attack in Florida.\"\nBlack bears mainly eat the tender and fresh leaves of Sabal palms, as well as acorns and berries. Recent weeks of dry weather likely have reduced their food supply.\n\"If we don't get some relief soon,\" Everitt said,\" we're probably going to see a lot more of it.\""

      "Having parked near the car wash beside the supermarket, I came away to wait for my wife to come from work. Coming my way from across the parking lot was what society would consider a bum  . From the looks of him, he had no car, no home, no clean clothes, and no money. There are times when you feel generous but there are other times that you just don't want to be bothered  . This was one of those \"don't want to be bothered times.\"\n\"I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,\" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat on the seat by the bus stop but he didn't look like he could have enough money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke, \"That's a very pretty car\". He was ragged   but he had an air of dignity   around him. I said, \"thanks,\" without taking a look at him.\nHe sat there quietly for a moment. The expected begging for money never came. As the silence between us widened something inside said, \"Ask him if he needs any help.\" I was sure that he would say \"yes\". So I asked, \"Do you need any help?\" He answered in three simple words that I shall never forget. The three words shook me. \"Don't we all?\" he said.\nI was feeling successful and important, above a bum in the street, until those three words hit me. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, you need help too. However, no matter how little you have, you can give help too."

      "In the 1960s, medical researchers Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe developed a checklist of stressful events. They appreciated the tricky point that any major change can be stressful. Bad events like \"serious illness of a family member\" were high on the list, but so were some helpful life-changing events like marriage.\nWhen you take the Holmes-Rahe test you must remember that the score does not show how you deal with stress ---it only shows how much you have to deal with. And we now know that the way you deal with these events dramatically affects your chances of staying healthy. By the early 1970s, hundreds of similar studies had followed Holmes and Rahe. And millions of Americans who work and live under stress worried over the reports. Somehow the research got boiled down to a memorable message. Women's magazines ran titles like \"Stress causes illness\".\nIf you want to stay physically and mentally healthy the articles said avoid stressful events. But such simplistic advice is impossible to follow. Even if stressful events are dangerous, many -- like the death of a loved one -- are impossible to avoid. Moreover, any warning to avoid all stressful events is a prescription for staying away from chances as well as trouble. Since any change can be stressful, a person who wanted to be completely free of stress would never marry, have a child, take a new job or move. The idea that all stress makes you sick also takes no notice of a lot of what we know about people. It supposes we're not active in the face of the difficult situation. But what about human ability and creativity? Many come through periods of stress with more physical and mental strength than they had before. We also know that a long time without change or challenge can lead to boredom and physical and mental pressure."

      "\"Is there anything else you need, honey?\" my dad asked me as he put three twenty dollar bills in my hand. I was traveling back home from a family visit, and after treating me to breakfast and filling my car with gas, it was obvious that my dad wanted to make sure that I would be okay on the road.\n\"No, Dad. You've done so much already. Thank you!\" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.\nBut this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn't always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away. I could always make sure of that.\nEven now, almost 30 years later, I treasure knowing that I can pick up the phone and call Dad, and he'll be there for me. I have a wonderful husband, but that hasn't changed how Dad sees me. I'm still his child and he loves to see that my needs are met.\nI remember a time when I was shopping in a hardware store   with Dad. I mentioned my plans to paint one wall in my house. Well, that's all it took for Dad to take action. By the time I got to the checkout  line, all the supplies I picked out were put out of my hands and placed with things he bought.\nThen there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few \" items\". By the time we were finished, my shopping cart was full of groceries from every shelf in the store! My sister and I joke that if you don't want Dad to buy it for you, avoid even mentioning you want something."

      "I am ex-navy officer  and now working as a primary school volunteer teacher in Chiang Rai. Our school is located in the most northern part of Thailand.\nI used to teach according to my plan and in addition I had to take care of students` safety. Early this month(November) we all needed to put on our light jacket to prevent cool weather. One morning during the first break I saw a group of primary level boys were playing police and thief game. They were a playing with a plastic pistol , which can shoot with plastic balls. It seemed to me very dangerous for their eyes. Immediately I called them and ask to hand over their toy gun. I placed it between my back bone and waist belt. No one can see it because it is under my light jacket.\nIn the afternoon I needed to pay my house electric bill and I had to _ some money from Kung Thai Bank. I walked into the bank and sat in waiting chair with other customers. I relaxed my back to the seat and then I realized that toy gun in my body. Oh, God! I made a big mistake because it is gun forbidden area. I looked around and my eyes met with the guard's eyes.\nI became sweating and couldn`t move from my seat until my turn announced from public addresser. As soon as I received my money and I shouted without voice \" I will never make the same mistake again\". The following period before I taught my lesson to class I told them what happened to me today. All my students enjoyed laughing without end."

      "Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,\nHere I am! I traveled yesterday for four hours in a train.It's a funny feeling, isn't it? I never rode in one before.\n     College is the biggest, most puzzling place--I get lost whenever I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less confused; also I will tell you about my lessons. Classes don't begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.\n    It seems strange to be writing letters to somebody you don't know. It seems strange for me to be writing letters at all--I've never written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are not a model kind.\n    Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me. I must take care to be very respectful.\n    But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little personality? I might as well write letters to Dear Flagpole or Dear Clothes-line.\n    I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I belonged to somebody now, and it's a very comfortable feeling. I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon. There are just three things that I know: I, You are tall. II. You are rich. III. You hate girls.\n     I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather rude to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's rude to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you won't stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get broke in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! So I've decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind. It's just a private pet name we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.\n    The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. It's very lifeful. There it goes! Lights out. Good night.\n     Observe how precisely I obey rules--due to my training in the John Grier Home.\n           Yours most respectfully,\n       Jerusha Abbott\n        to Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith"

      "Tiger Mom, ks5u\n       You've been criticized  a lot since you published your memoir , Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. One problem is that some people don't get your humor. They think you're serious about all things, and they think Lulu and I are oppressed  by our ill mother. That is not true.\n       But for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us -- dogs included -- squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix.\n       I admit: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd skipped. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did. \n       A lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, that's funny. I think your strict parenting forced me to be more independent. Early on, I decided to be an easy child to raise. Maybe I got it from Daddy -- he taught me not to care what people think and to make my own choices -- but I also decided to be who I want to be. \n       Everybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you rejected because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people are convinced that Lulu and I are scarred for life. Maybe if I had poured my heart into it, I would have been upset. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't even sharpen the pencil. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel you were rejecting me. If I actually tried my best at something, you'd never throw it back in my face.\n       ...And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you.\n                                                         Yours, \n                                                            Sophia"

      "Confidence Comes From Treating Others As Equals\nThere's been recent discussion over Chinese attitudes toward foreigners,caused by another quarrel between a foreigner and a taxi driver.According to the studies described in the Oxford Handbook of Chinese Psychology,Chinese have lower self-confidence compared to Westerners.Yet does the result still apply to the Chinese people today?\nYes and no.For the moment,different attitudes toward foreigners can still be found in China's society,with some displaying low self-confidence like\"Foreigners are awesome  ,and Western countries are awesome.We should respect them and be as polite as possible,and shouldn't let them look down on us,\"and a few unfriendly opinions such as\"Some foreigners are rude and disrespectful,and their level of civility   is far behind China.\"\nChinese used to be lacking in self-confidence.It might start from the modern history,after the failure in the Opium wars,and the following humiliation   of being bullied   and brought to their knees by Western guns.And the dark history is still to some extent affecting our mentality   today.\nFor some time,the Western world represents the best of everything in some Chinese eyes.But our state of mind is gradually changing.When asked\"What makes you feel proud of your country?\"in school classes in China,answers vary from the World Expo to the Olympic Games,from athletes to astronauts,from the mushrooming skyscrapers to busy metropolises,which have all filled us with growing self-confidence.\nWhile answering the question\"Since China is so good today and Chinese people are more confident,why are an increasing number of Chinese emigrating abroad?\"Zhang Weiwei,a professor at Fudan University,replied that at least 70percent of Chinese migrants   become more patriotic   after leaving their home country,no matter whether they have become a naturalized citizen of another nation or not.Such result and experiences are much more convincing and have better effect than dozens of\"patriotic education\"classes.\nThere is no reason for us not to be self-confident.We live in the world's second-largest economy.Chinese net financial assets per capita   and the purchasing power of people have seen a sharp rise,with more and more people starting to purchase works of art,instead of only necessities.These all indicate a rising standard of life and self-confidence.\nNevertheless,the point of the changing attitudes toward ourselves or other countries is not realizing other nations are better or worse than China,but treating them like how we treat our fellow Chinese.That is what confidence means,not being condescending  ,not worshiping,but looking each other in the eye with trust and respect."

      "I walked down the hall heading to see my 88-year-old grandma who had been in hospital. Each member of the family was taking turns sitting with her because of her dementia  . As I did I looked very carefully at some of the rooms on this wing of the hospital, and it seemed that almost every bed held an elderly person. Some appeared to be confused, and some just looked lonely. I couldn't help but notice that there was no family there, no one to care them, and no one to reduce the ache of loneliness. My heart broke inside me.\nThey are aging, with withered   skin on their faces and hands, their eyes look tried, and yet no one notices them. Could it be that we are far too busy to slow down and give a moment of our time to anyone that may swerve   us off the course we are traveling on? Are we afraid of those who have come before us to pave the way, afraid that they carry some awful disease that if we get too close we might catch it?\nWhatever the case may be, one day we will be those same people that we long to avoid. We pay thousands of dollars for staying young, and we may turn up the music to forget the thoughts of getting older. But, try as we might, time and age will catch up with us.\nWe seem to have come to detest   the elderly. While we once held them in high regard and honor, always enjoying their stories of history, we now see them as a pain, always in our way. Isn't it time we wake up?\nSo, next time you see a withered hand extended in need, or peer into the eyes of a lonely aging face, don't run or look away. Remember, it might just be you in that place one day."

      "Something as simple as a smile can mean friendliness in one culture, but impatience in another. Even silence means different things in different places.\nWhen trying to communicate in a foreign language, it's natural to use gestures as a way of explaining your points.\nTapping your finger to your temple is a gesture to show memory in North America, but suggests insanity in Russia. Even nodding one's head to show \"yes\" or shaking one's head to show \"no\" can be misunderstood abroad. The yes-no gestures are different in countries like Bulgaria and Albania. In Turkey, \"no\" is gestured by nodding the head up and down.\nIt's not just individual gestures that can cause miscommunication, but the rate of gesturing can also cause miscommunication. Some countries, like Italy and Spain, are known for talking with their hands. Others use few body movements as a form of politeness. In parts of East Asia, the gesture is considered unpleasant behavior, and even rude.\nBritain, along with many countries of northern Europe and the Far East, is classed as a \"non-contact\"culture, in which there's very little physical contact in people's daily communication. Even accidentally touching someone's arm is considered rude. By comparison, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of socializing.\nNaturally, these different standards of contact can lead to misunderstanding. An Argentinian may see a Scandinavian as cold, while the Scandinavian may see the Argentinian as impolite.\nIn most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness. But in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, however, unbroken eye contact would be considered rude. These cultures tend to pay more attention to hierarchy , and avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect for bosses and elder. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees to their bosses."

      "Jobs and work do much more than most of us realize to provide happiness and contentment.We're all used to thinking that work provides the material things of life--the goods and services that make our modern civilization possible.But we are much less conscious of the degree to which work provides the more important psychological wellbeing that can make the difference between a full and an empty life.\nHistorically,work has been associated with slavery and sin  and punishment.And in our own day we are used to bearing traditional complaints.Against this background,it may well come as a surprise to learn that not only psychologists but other behavioral scientists have come to accept the positive contribution of work to the individual's happiness and sense of personal achievement.Work is more than a necessity for most human beings;it is the focus of their lives,the source of their identity and creativity.\nRather than a punishment of a burden,work is the opportunity to realize one's potential.And the opposite is true,too.For large numbers of people,the absence of work is harmful to their health.Retirement often brings many problems surrounding the \"What do I do with myself?\"question,even though there may be no financial cares.Large numbers of people regularly get headaches and other illnesses on weekends when they don't have their jobs to go to,and must take care of themselves.It has been observed that unemployment,quite apart from financial pressures,brings enormous psychological troubles and that many individuals'conditions become worse rapidly when jobless.\nBut why?Why should work be such a significant source of human satisfaction?A good share of the answer rests in the kind of pride that is stimulated by the job,by the activity of accomplishing."

      "It was an afternoon Truman would never forget.\nRayburn and his friend were talking in the office before Truman arrived. The telephone rang. It was a call from the White House asking whether Vice-President Truman had arrived yet. No, Rayburn replied. The caller asked to have him telephone the White House as soon as he arrived.\nTruman entered a minute later. He immediately called the White House. As he talked, his face became white. He put down the phone and raced out of the door to his car.\nTruman arrived at the White House within minutes. An assistant took him to the president's private living area. Eleanor Roosevelt, the president's wife, was waiting for him there. \"Harry,\" she said, \"the president is dead.\" Truman was shocked. He asked Mrs. Roosevelt if there was anything he could do to help her. But her reply made clear to him that his own life had suddenly changed. \"Is there anything we can do for you ?\" Mrs. Roosevelt asked the new president, \" _ .\"\nTruman had been a surprise choice for vice-president at the Democratic Party nominating convention in nineteen forty-four. Delegates considered several other candidates before they chose him as Roosevelt's running mate. That was at a time when presidential candidates did not make their own choices for vice-president.\nHarry Truman lacked the fame,the rich family and the strong speech-making skills of Franklin Roosevelt.He was a much simpler man.He grew up in the Midwestern state of Missouri.Truman only studied through high school but took some nighttime law school classes.He worked for many years as a farmer and a small businessman,but without much success.\nTruman had long been interested in politics.When he was almost forty,he finally won several low-level positions in his home state.By nineteen thirty-four,he was popular enough in Missouri to be nominated and elected to the United States Senate. And he won re-election six years later.\nMost Americans, however, knew little about Harry Truman when he became president.They knew he had close ties to the Democratic Party political machine in his home state.But they had also heard that he was a very honest man.They could see that Truman had strongly supported President Roosevelt's New Deal programs.But they could not be sure what kind of president Truman would become.\nAt the center of all the action was Harry Truman.It was not long before he showed Americans and the world that he had the ability to be a good president.He was honest,strong and willing to make decisions."

      "One evening I went out and left my 17-year-old son in charge of his 8-year-old brother and 4-year-old sister.On this occasion, the work was made less troublesome by the presence of his girlfriend.I left with complete confidence that the older children would do a wonderful job of babysitting the younger children.Later, I discovered that complete confidence was the last thing I should have left home with.\nI had decided to return home earlier than planned so that my son and his girlfriend could go out.I called home with this happy news.But instead of hearing his cheerful, grateful voice on the other end of the line, all I heard was the sound of a telephone ringing.\nIt was, I should point out, after 10 p.m.,when the two younger children should have been in bed, and when the two older children should have been answering the phone.\"I'll give him a lesson,\" I said. I decided they must be outside.Why they might be outside at 10:30 on a winter night I had no idea, but it was the only explanation I could come up with.\nFinally, in desperation, I called his girlfriend's house. After what seemed like countless rings, his girlfriend answered.\"Yes,\" she said brightly, \"He's right here.\"\nHe came on the phone.I was not my usual calm, rational self. After all, one of the rules of survival for modern parents is that you can't trust modern teenagers.\"Where are the children?\" I said.He said they were with him.They had done nothing wrong.My son had taken the younger children over to his girlfriend's house just for ice cream and cake.This was too good to be believed. Well, it turns out that I shouldn't have believed it.It was only part of the truth.\nThe following Saturday evening we were at my parents' home, celebrating my birthday.My oldest son gave me the children's gifts.Mounted and framed were a series of lovely color photographs of my children, dressed in their best clothes, and wearing their most wonderful expressions.They are pictures to treasure a lifetime, all taken by the father of my son's girlfriend."

      "Why don't birds get lost on their long migratory   flights? Scientists have puzzled over this question for many years. Now they're beginning to fill in the blanks.\nNot long ago, experiments showed that birds rely on the sun to guide them during daylight hours. But what about birds that fly mainly by night? Tests with artificial stars have proved conclusively that certain night-flying birds are able to follow the stars in their long-distance flights.\nOne such bird, a warbler  , had spent its lifetime in a cage and had never flown under a natural sky. Yet it showed an inborn ability to use the stars for guidance. The bird's cage was placed under an artificial star-filled sky at migration time. The bird tried to fly in the same direction as that taken by his outdoor cousins. Any change in the direction of the make-be-live stars caused a change in the direction of his flight. Scientists think that warblers, when flying in daylight, use the sun for guidance. But the stars are apparently their main means of navigation  . What do they do when the stars are hidden by clouds? Apparently, they find their way by such landmarks as mountain ranges, coast lines, and river courses. But when it's too dark to see these, the warblers circle helplessly, unable to get their direction."

It has tall rock walls and streams that splash down in waterfalls. More than two million visitors come to the valley each year.\nOne ranger says the number of visitors is more than the land can handle. The valley has 4,500 camping spots. It has a hotel that can hold 4,000 families. This is still not enough to handle all of the visitors. The valley has grown so big that it has a lot of traffic and crime.\nA worker says the park is trying to keep the beauty of the park and let everyone visit. Some areas have been fenced off from people and planted with seeds to try to keep them beautiful.\nA former worker thinks Yosemite should get more money to take better care of the park.

      "The view over a valley of a tiny village with thatched roof cottages around a church; a drive through a narrow village street lined with thatched cottages painted pink or white; the sight over the rolling hills of a pretty collection of thatched farm buildings  _ these are still common sights in parts of England. Most people will agree that the thatched roof is an essential part of the attraction of the English countryside. \nThatching is in fact the oldest of all the building crafts practiced in the British Isles. Although thatch has always been used for cottage and farm buildings, it was once used for castles and churches, too.   \nThatching is a solitary craft, which often runs in families. The craft of thatching as it is practiced has today changed very little since the Middle Ages. Over 800 full-time thatchers are employed in England and Wales today, maintaining and renewing the old roofs as well as thatching newer houses. Many property owners choose thatch not only for its beauty but because they know it will keep them cool in summer and warm in winter. \nIn fact, if we look at developing countries, over half the world lives under thatch, but they all do it in different ways. People in developing countries are often unwilling to go back to traditional materials and would prefer modern buildings. However, they may lack the money to allow them to import the necessary materials. Their temporary mud huts with thatched roofs of wild grasses often only last six months. Thatch which has been done the British way lasts from twenty to sixty years, and is an effective defence against the heat."

      "How come it seems like every kid today is a winner of something, when we know every kid can't be a star? These days. Kids are first divided by age, then by achievement, and often by the type of performance.\nAmerican culture in general has increasingly accepted prizes and awards. The winner-take-all prize tradition that characterizes American culture started in the early 20th century along with the development of organized American sporting culture. In the second half of the 20th century, the attention on competition, and rankings  in general, grew rapidly. The 1970s had the most prize creations, including the addition of even more prizes to fields such as film and literature. Music competitions, including the introduction of the American Music Awards, saw similar growth in this time period. Since then, prizes have become increasingly fashionable, along with children's competitive activities. \nWhile awards may help people set goals and practice their activity, awards may also be a business practice. Trophies  help make sure that customers return year after year. Keeping kids, parents, teachers and coaches happy with lots of recognition keeps the money flowing to the organizers of the competitions.\nTrophies may keep kids coming back, and their parents paying, but research finds that giving kids trophies for doing an activity means lower levels of encouragement. High levels of encouragement are exactly what we want to foster   among kids to help them get long-term success and take pride in a well-earned achievement. So parents need to be careful when trying to get titles for their young kids, and make sure the honor created is for their kids and not for praise from anyone else in their children's lives."

      "If you live in a city where everyone rushes, realize that you don't have to be like everyone else.You can be different.\nI can't give you a step-by-step guide to moving slower, but here are some things to consider and perhaps adopt, if they work for your life.\n1.Do less\nCut back on your projects, on your task list, on how much you try to do each day.Focus not on quantity but on quality.Pick 2 or 3 important things-or even just one important thing- and work on those first.\n2.Have fewer meetings\nMeetings are usually a big waste of time and make you rush.Try to have blocks of time with no interruptions, so you don't have to rush from one meeting to another.\n3.Give yourself time to get ready and get there\nIf you're constantly rushing to appointments or other places you have to be, it's because you don't allot  enough time in your schedule for preparing and for traveling.Pad your schedule to allow time for this stuff.If you think it only takes you 10 minutes to get ready for work or a date, perhaps give yourself 30 to 45 minutes so you don't have to shave in a rush or put on makeup in the car.\n4.Practice being comfortable with sitting doing nothing\nWhen people have to wait, they become impatient or uncomfortable.Try standing in a line and just watching and listening w people around you.It takes practice, but after a while, you'll do it with a smile.\n5.Realize that if it doesn't get done, that's Ok.\nThere's always tomorrow.And yes, I know that's a frustrating attitude for some of you who don't like laziness or living without firm deadlines, but it's also reality.The world likely won't end if you don't get that task done today.Your boss might get mad, but the company won't _ and the life will inevitably go on.\nTry these things out.Life is better when unrushed.\nRemember the quote: If nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you."

      "Starting a new school term is always exciting. It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.\nMost schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.\nThe most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.\nFrankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common."

      "After the examination, the doctor told my parents my sight would get worse and that I would lose my sight finally. On the way home from hospital, no one said a word. One day, would I only imagine the scenery beyond the glass rather than see it?\nThat September, I entered middle school. Most nights I had homework that included an armful of books to read. To keep up with other children, I took great trouble to finish the task. With my nose a couple of inches from the page, I was tired easily. What's worse, after I had read several pages on my own, the words slipped off the page into inky pools.\nHowever, then I did not have audio books and electronic devices like kids do now. Instead, Mom volunteered to read out loud. Mom worked part-time, cleaned the house, cooked and spent time with Grandma. In spite of being so busy, she showed up in my room like clockwork. She put on her reading glasses. Mom always thought those glasses made her look old. To me, she looked like a teacher.\nIn my room, Mom's voice competed with the ticking of the clock. Being forced to focus on listening, I found a way to keep my marks up and compete with the other kids. When the teacher asked a question, I raised my hand with confidence. Teachers praised me for having a good memory. Reading removed my fear for my failing sight, reading also made me curious about other people's challenges and how they managed. Though I could not use my eyes to fix on each passage, my mind lit up with every new book.\nTrue to what the doctor said, the worst came, but thanks to Mom, my sense of hearing now allows me to \"see\". This was the most precious   gift from a mother to her child."

      "It's been called the \"hardest word,\" but some women seem to use the word \"sorry\" as everything from a way to interject their thoughts into a conversation to a way of prefacing any request for help. Yesterday, Pantene even released a video about how often women apologize in everyday situations.\nApologizing unnecessarily puts women in a subservient  position and makes people lose respect for them, says executive coach and radio host Bonnie Marcus. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of the Manhattan-based think tank, Center for Talent Innovation and author of Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Talent and Success, says using \"sorry\" frequently undermines our gravitas and makes them appear unfit for leadership.\nIt's not like women don't know it's a bad habit. So, why do they do it?\nBusiness consultant Kathryn D. Cramer, author of Lead Positive: What Highly Effective Leaders See, Say, and Do, says women are socialized from an early age to focus on relationships and nurturing. Any sign of strength can be off-putting, so they're conditioned to soften communication that can be construed as assertive or aggressive. Apologizing before speaking--or in any situation where women must show strength or where there is potential for conflict--is one way of doing _ .\nShe adds that workplace culture contributes to its use, too. In many cases, strong women need to find ways to temper  their personalities or risk being called \"rude,\" \"abrasive,\" or even risk their jobs if they don't find ways to soften others' perception, she says. But saying \"sorry\" too often can be more career-killing than being disliked. So, it's time to purge the word unless you really have something to be sorry about.\nMarcus suggests keeping a log  of when you \"sorry,\" what the situation was, and how you felt. Sometimes, \"sorry\" is just a verbal tic , but some usage patterns may indicate a situation or person who makes you feel insecure, she says. Being aware of those triggers and how they influence your language can help you be more vigilant in \"changing your communication so you're coming from a position of strength and equality,\" she says.\nTrusted friends can help you break the habit by quietly letting you know when you're using \"sorry\" inappropriately, Cramer says. Knowing that you're under another watchful eye is also going to make you more aware of your speech, she says.\nSometimes, saying \"sorry\" is easier than thinking about the word you really want to say, or becomes a way of softening your words or opinion before they're even out of your mouth, Cramer says. If either is the case, be more careful to choose the word or phrase you really mean to say. \"Start your statement with, 'Let me say this...' or some other word or phrase that reflects your meaning better than saying 'sorry,'\" she says.\nSometimes, instead of saying \"sorry,\" it's best to not say anything at all. Hewlett encourages women to embrace the power of silence. Using silence deliberately makes people uncomfortable, but not in an aggressive way,\" she says."

Blame! Blame!\nIt seems natural to sing this self-pitying song,but the truth is,if you don't like your life,you should do something about it.No one else knows exactly how you feel or what you need.No one can read your mind correctly.You are the only one with the power to cheek your life,and if you want it to be different,you can change what you're doing.\nWhen you're in trouble,don't give away your power to decide how you feel about yourself. Choose how you want to think and act.Other people can't make you unhappy or angry.They only act in their own way and then it's up to you to decide how you will respond .For example,your friends go out to lunch without you and you feel very angry.How are you going to act? You may blame your friends,\"They are not kind.Who needs them anyway?\" Or you may tell your friends how you feel,listen to their explanation,and let them know you'd like to be invited next time.\nWhen you decide everything in your own way,you're getting hold of your own life and shaping it according to your tastes and feelings.You can choose to be happy,to make friends and to build an interesting life.When you blame others for what is or isn't happening in your life,you have stopped growing or learning.\nOne of the most important rules is that you can never change another person by your direct action.The only person you have the right to change is yourself.Once you change,the other person has something different to respond to and change is possible.If you want change in your life,begin with yourself."

      "What do you think of advertising such as TV commercials and magazine advertisements?\n  Oh Yoon Kwon from Korea: Nowadays, we can see so many advertisements. Some people say it is just a waste. However, I don't agree. Sometimes, I think there are too many on TV, but sometimes I like to watch just the advertisements . I think they are so funny. I like to watch them when I am bored. Another reason why I like advertisements is I like Internet games. Some Internet games are free because of the advertisements.\n  Inna Ignatovich from Russia: Advertising is an important part of marketing. You can't escape it. Sometimes it bothers me a lot. But also, sometimes I enjoy it. Some commercials are created so professionally that they become a piece of TV art. Unfortunately, it is a rare situation. Some years ago, I couldn't imagine the interruption of an interesting movie by advertising. Now it is reality, and we understand its necessary.\n  Christine Le Prince from France: In my opinion, advertisements are part of our economic system. We can't do without it. Sometimes commercials are very useful; they can inform you on a new product which you wouldn't know about otherwise. However, I think that we are bombarded with too many advertisements, especially on TV. When you want to watch a movie, you are interrupted every five minutes. It is so boring.

      "Every night I have to go over the books he has learned from in class, signing each page to show the teacher that I have understood what the children have already done. \nMy child waits for me to play with him while I have my nose buried in his books. \n\"Have you done your homework yet, mom?\"\nAt least once a week we are handed fliers about various events going on, while the homework keeps piling up. \nAnd while my son throws his books in his bag every day quite happily, it's my responsibility to check he has everything he needs, that his lunchbox is washed and dry, that his water bottle is clean and full. \nMy child is sailing through the classes, especially, of course, English, in which they have been asked to choose an English name and decorate a nameplate for lessons. \nMy son, who already has an English name, has chosen another one, Harry. \nWu Shenhao, a little boy from my child's kindergarten, has chosen Helen. The girl who sits next to him has chosen Peter. \nEnglish is the one lesson I am not trapped with illegible  requests and homework. The kind teacher has decided to let us off this one. \nWith 42 children in a class I have piles of respect for the teachers who sustain their devoted, detailed training of these young minds. \nPerhaps with the homework load they are causing some kind of revenge on the parents who have produced these little charges, and in doing so have caused them all this work.  \nTo my little boy, it's all good fun with a bit of writing and numbers thrown in. \nHe loves most of it, especially the weekly flagraising ceremony, which, while a little surprising to the little ones, is at least accompanied by lively music and bright red flags."

      "Dear Jorge,\nAre you enjoying your break from school? My family are now in Sacramento, California. We are here paying a visit to visit to my aunt Gloria. We have been to the California State Capital Building, the nature center, and the zoo. I have seen many interesting things, but one stands out above the rest. This morning we drove from my aunt's home to Calistoga to see California's Old Faithful Geyser . I had read about it in my book, Sightseeing in California; Where You Should Go.You have probably heard of Old Faithful, the geyser father north in Yellowstone National Park. This California geyser is sometimes called\" Little Old Faithful.\"\nWhen we arrived California's Old Faithful was only a calm pool of water. The geyser didn't look very deep. \" What's the big deal?\" I wondered. As I turned, I saw some steam rising from the water. Before I knew it, there was hot water shooting up about 60 feet into the air. We could not believe our eyes! It continued for almost three minutes.\nAunt Gloria told me that the water came from an underground river. She also said that the water temperature was about 95degC. This water can sometimes shoot 170 feet into the air.\nMy aunt said that other geysers around the world reach hotter temperatures and shoot water even higher than California's Old Faithful Geyser. I'd love to learn more about this geyser and other geysers in different countries when I get home. I'll see you soon!\nYour friend,\nBennetto"

      "Sleeping in a room with too much light has been linked to an increased risk of piling on the pounds, a study shows. A team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \"light enough to see across\" at night. However, they caution there is not enough evidence to advise people to buy thicker curtains or turn off lights.\nThe women were asked to rate the amount of light in their bedrooms at night as: Light enough to read. Light enough to see across the room, but not read. Light enough to see your hand in front of you, but not across the room. Too dark to see your hand or you wear a mask.\nProf Anthony Swerdlow told the BBC: \"In this very large group of people there is an association between reported light exposure at night and overweight and obesity. But there is not sufficient evidence to know if making your room darker would make any difference to your weight. There might be other explanations for the association, but the findings are encouraging enough to guarantee further scientific investigation.\"\nThe light is disrupting the body clock, which stems from our evolutionary past when we were active when it was light in the day and resting when it was dark at night. Light changes mood, physical strength and even the way we process food in a 24-hour cycle. Artificial light is known to disrupt the body clock by delaying the production of the sleep hormone melatonin.\nProf Derk-Jan Dijk said there would be no harm in trying to make bedrooms darker. He told the BBC: \"People in general are not aware of the light present in their bedroom. I think people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker.\" Street lights, some alarm clocks and standby lights on electrical equipment such as televisions could light a room, he said. \"Overall this study points to the importance of darkness,\" he concluded."

      "Tanzania Tarangire is a national park in Tanzania. The park itself covers an area of around 2,850 square kilometers, making it the sixth largest park of its kind in the country. I recently visited it to see what it was like.\nOne of the first sightings upon entering the park I found was a huge group of elephants. Our guide told us Tarangire was probably the best place in Tanzania to find large groups of elephants. We continued to watch the elephants as they stood under trees and scratched themselves against the trees to hit the spot of an itch .\nTo the right of the elephant group, we noticed a big tree. Our guide informed us that this was a baobab tree and that Tarangire was one of the best national parks in Africa to see so many baobab trees.\nAs we continued our drive through the park, we finally reached a watering hole. Our guide warned us there were lions all around us. Most of them were resting in the shade under bushes, but there was one that was drinking from the watering hole directly in front of us. We then noticed there were a couple of fresh zebra corpses --it seemed as if the resting lions had killed them!\nOur final big sighting was one that none of us were expecting to see!We pulled over to where there was a large gathering of cars, with a sleeping leopard there!We took photos happily and excitedly and observed its surprising body before returning to our hotel as it was getting late.\nSo I hope you enjoyed my description of Tarangire,and that I've inspired you to add this amazing park to your very own Tanzania travel plan."

      "Jack lay, quiet and unmoving, for thirty minutes while a stranger repeatedly stabbed  him with sharp needles, causing blood to pour steadily out of his leg. Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by it that he decided to get one too. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.\nThe desire to be accepted by one's friends or peers can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, that person is more likely to do the same thing.\nThe media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos--people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars, famous sports heroes with tattoos in magazines, fashion models wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colorful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.\nMany people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings-in other words, to show their individuality . A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform, a sign of fashion, or an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself. For Jack, it was a mixture of all three."

      "Disappointed with delays in Sacramento (the capital of California), Bay Area officials said Thursday they planned to take matters into their own hands to regulate the region's growing piles of electronic waste.\nA San Jose council woman and a San Francisco supervisor said they would propose new local plans aimed at controlling electronic waste if the California law-making body fails to act on two bills delayed in the Assembly. They are among a growing number of California cities and countries that have expressed the same intention\nEnvironmentalists and local governments are increasingly concerned about the danger caused by old electronic devices and the cost of safely recycling those products. An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in California homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead   and other dangerous substances, and are already banned from California landfills.\nA bill by Senator   Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.\nA separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste. If passed, the measures would put California at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.\nBut high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state shops.\n\"What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they're not supposed to throw computers in the dust bin,\" said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.\nComputer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added. Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn't contracted to junk dealers who send the poisonous parts overseas.\n\"The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural China,\" said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. His group is pushing for some refinement to Sher's bill that would prevent the export of e-waste."

      "One of the most common complaints of people living in the city is annoying neighbors. Here are some ways to handle noisy neighbors. \nAccept Some Degree of Apartment Noise\nBefore getting worked up over the noisy neighbors in the apartment, make sure to have \nrealistic expectations. Everyone living in an apartment building is bound to hear noise from other units' televisions, music, and children occasionally.   \nUnderstand Noisy Neighbors from their point of view\nIt's probably the case that the neighbor who is driving everyone crazy doesn't realize how \nfar his noise is carrying. Remember that noise level is difficult to control with children. Babies \nunavoidably cry in the middle of the night. \nMeet the Neighbors and Be Friendly \nMaking a friendly gesture will surprisingly reduce apartment noise. Neighbors who know\n each other will probably be much more careful not to bother each other.  \n Address Noise Calmly and Face-to-Face \n If a loud noise needs to be addressed, go to the offending apartment personally and knock politely on the door. Being polite will usually bring a polite \nresponse \nReport Noisy Neighbors to the Landlord \nIf a noise issue becomes a constant problem or doesn't improve after a personal request,\n it's time to bring it up to management. Make sure to be objective and fair in your report, and be \nable to record the frequency of the problem and provide details about it.   \nThings to Avoid when Dealing with a Loud Neighbor \nThere are some  \"don't\"s  when it comes to dealing life with a loud apartment \nneighbor. Don't \n*Seek revenge  or try to \"outdo\" a noisy neighbor \n* Complain to them face to face repeatedly about the same issue \n* Suffer in silence \nDoing these things may work for some time, but they're never good long-term solutions. \nInstead, they will probably only exacerbate the situation."

      "The Greatest Navigational Journey\nIn 1787 Captain Bligh was given command of \"The Bounty\", a three-year-old merchant ship. His mission was to transport breadfruit plants from the island of Tahiti to the West Indies. We know the popular story of this voyage and the rebellion, in which Bligh has been presented as hard, violent and thoroughly unpleasant captain.

For example he made sure that his crew got exercise, insisted on cleanliness on his ship, and adopted the practice of giving them a drink which prevented scurvy every day.\nWhen Captain Bligh arrived in Tahiti, it became clear that it would be some months before the breadfruit trees were ready to be taken to the West Indies. Instead of going off right away, he gave his crew extended shore leave. This may have been a mistake as many were unhappy about leaving when the time came. Finally, on the return journey the rebellion took place. The ship was under the command of the rebels and Captain Bligh had to leave in a small boat.\nCaptain Bligh's achievement was to get to dry land successfully. It is one of the supreme examples of seamanship. Apart from Bligh there were 18 members of his crew sailing in an open boat about 23 feet long and 7 feet wide. They took with them 25 gallons of water, 150 pounds of bread and 30 pounds of pork. They had no guns or other weapons. The boat was so low in the water that it seemed likely to sink at any time. On one occasion Captain Bligh tried to land on an island to get more water. He and his men were attacked by hostile natives and one of the crew was killed. At this point Bligh decided to sail directly to the Dutch settlement on the island of Timor without stopping. The distance was about 4,000 miles. The voyage took about 42 days and he had no advanced navigational equipment. However, his skill and commitment proved equal to the task and amazingly no one else died. It was truly a remarkable achievement."

      "The World Health Organization says obesity rates are rising in Pacific island countries. So, too, are health problems linked to being overweight.\nThe WHO says a major reason for the rising obesity rates is an increase in imported foods. It says many Pacific islanders have replaced their traditional diets of vegetables and fruits with imported processed foods.\nDr.Temu Waqanivalu is with the World Health Organization's South Pacific office in Suva, Fiji.He says many of the imported products lack nutritional value.\nTemu Waqanivalu said: \"In some of the places, you'd be amazed to see how a bottle of Coke is cheaper than a bottle of water. I think that represents the kind of offenvironment we've created that doesn't really encourage or make lifestyle choices an easy choice for the population.\"\nAnd a lack of physical activity among many Pacific islanders only adds to the obesity problem.\nThe WHO says more than 50 percent of the population is overweight in at least ten Pacific island countries. The rate is as high as 80 percent among women in the territory of American Samoa. Fiji had the lowest obesity rate at 30 percent.\nIn all, almost ten million people live in Pacific island countries. The WHO estimates that about 40 percent of them have health disorders related to diet and nutrition.\nDiabetes rates are among the highest in the world. Forty-seven percent of the people in American Samoa have diabetes. So do 44 percent of the people in Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand.\nBy comparison, the diabetes rate is 13 percent in the United States, a country that has its own problems with rising obesity.\nOfficials also note an increase in nutritional problems like anemia and not enough vitamin A in the diets of Pacific islanders. Dr. Waqanivalu says treating conditions related to obesity and diet puts pressure on limited health resources and budgets."

Her comeback comes 32 years after she won three golds at the Munich Olympics. \nSchipper, now a 17-year-old from Brisbane with a bright future of going to Athens for her first Olympics, yesterday recalled  her time with Gould five years ago. \n\"I was at a national youth camp on the Gold Coast and Shane had come along to talk to us and watch us train,\" Schipper explained. \"It seemed as if we had long been good friends. I don't know why. We just started talking and _ went from there.\"\n\"She had a lot to share with all of us at that camp. She told us stories about what it was like at big meets like the Olympics and what it's like to be on an Australian team. It was really interesting.\"\nNext time, things will be more serious. \"I will still be swimming in the 50m butterfly at the nationals, so there is a chance that I could actually be competing against Shane Gould,\" said Schipper, who burst into the scene at last year's national championships with second places in the 100m and 200m butterfly."

      "There is a growing number of kidults---or adults who wear the mask of maturity but prefer to pander  to their inner child.\nThey feel ill equipped for parenthood, because they don't see what values or lessons they could honestly pass on to their young, besides self-centeredness and a passion for the good things in life. They are trying to live by not acting their age.\nAs Ms Jane put it in her letter: I'm married, in my late 20s and enjoy a lifestyle other married graduate couples enjoy: winning and dining, tasteful clothes, travel and a career. Why give up all these for a baby?\nIt is reported that when asked whether they were adults, most people in their 20s answered they were not sure. This reflected a global economy in which people chased more _ to get better jobs that would comfortably support middle class living.\nBeing a kidult is not all about being selfish, though. With the untold uncertainties of war, fluctuating markets, disease and terrorism, many see this world as a poor place to live in--let alone bring kids up in. This seems especially so in urban living. All anyone wants after a long, hard day at work is some peace and quiet.\nMy classmate, Jenny, mused recently how our friends living in small Malaysian towns were onto their second or third kids. Maybe they just loved having children around. Or maybe, in their own way, they wanted to leave the world a better place than they found it.\nThat's how you, I and everyone know we have the chance to breathe air, touch grass and see sky.

      "Language is a major problem for the European Union (EU). The agreement or treaty   which created the organization that eventually became the EU, the Treaty of Rome, stated that each country's language must be treated equally. The original six countries had only three languages between them: French. German and Dutch/Flemish. However, there are now 15 countries in the EU, with a total of 12 languages. EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters.\nAll this translating is very expensive and time-consuming  . it is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches, and nearly half of the EU's administrative  costs are spent on this task. In the near future it is probably that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse.\nThe problem is not just cost: there are practical difficulties as well. With 12 languages, there are 132 possible \"translation situations\" that might be needed. It is often' difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from (for example) Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard.\nIn practice the problem has been made less serious by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials, since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries. Another commonly suggested solution is to make English the official language for all EU business. However, powerful member countries like France and Germany are strongly against it."

      "In a class this past December, after I wrote some directions on the board for students about their final examination, one young woman quickly took a picture of the board using her smart phone. When I looked in her direction, she apologized: \"Sorry. Was it wrong to take a picture?\"\n\"I can't read my own handwriting ,\"the young woman explained.\"It's best if I take a picture of your writing so I can understand the notes.\"\nThat remark started a class-wide conversation about taking a picture instead of taking notes. For those in the photo-taking camp, motivations extended beyond their inability to comprehend their own handwriting. Some took pictures of notes because they knew their phone was a safe place to store material. They might lose paper, they reasoned, but they wouldn't lose their phones. Some took photos because they wanted to record exactly the manner in which I had noted information on the board. Others told me that during class they liked to be able to listen to the discussion attentively.\nYet the use of cameras as note takers, though it may be convenient, does raise significant questions for the classroom. Is a picture an effective replacement for the process of note-taking?\nInstructors encourage students to take notes because the act of doing so is more than merely recording necessary information--it helps prepare the way for understanding. Encouraging students to take notes may be an old-fashioned instructional method, but just because a method has a long history doesn't mean it's out of date. Writing things down engages a student's brain in listening, visual, and kinesthetic learning--a view supported by a longstanding research. The act of writing down information enables a person to begin committing it to memory, and to process and combine it, establishing the building blocks of learning new concepts.\nTaking a picture does indeed record the information, but it deletes some of the necessary mental engagement that taking notes employs. So can the two be equally effective?\nI'm not sure how to measure the effectiveness of either method. For now, I allow students to take notes however they see fit--handwritten or photographed--because I figure that some notes, no matter the method of note-taking, are better than none."

      "Most people know that a wedding ring is symbolic of the bond  of love and commitment  between two people. But not everyone knows about the history behind this small yet powerful symbol. The history of the wedding ring goes back not just hundreds but thousands of years. No other currently practiced wedding tradition has been around as long.\nThe Egyptians were the first recorded civilization to use the wedding ring. In Egyptianhieroglyphics  a circle represented _ . Once a woman accepted the ring she became the \"property\" of the person who gave it to her and she was in a sense \"his.\" The first wedding ring could have been made of braided grass or hay (which would have been changed often), ivory, bone, or leather.  Eventually, metal was used, but the first wedding bands werecrude  and rough. However, the sentiment  remained the same-eternal commitment and love.\nThe Egyptians wore the wedding ring on the left hand because it was believed that a vein  in the left hand went straight to the heart. This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels. If you do not buy the wedding and engagement rings as a set you will want to be sure the styles are compatible . Choose carefully because this choice will need to stand the test of eternity."

Organizers called the meeting to work toward a treaty to fight rising temperatures on our planet. The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.\n    In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is leading government efforts to fight climate change. The agency just ended a series of public hearings across the country. The EPA was seeking comments as it considers tightening clean air rules for coal burning power plants.\n    David Doniger is a climate policy expert. He says it is the duty of the EPA to control carbon as a pollutant. He wants the agency to establish new rules that would move the United States toward a cleaner energy environment.\n     \"No one is coming up with standards that would knock out all those power plants. We're   talking about a shift from the dirtier ones to the cleaner ones, and from all those fossil fuel- powered ones towards renewable and even nuclear sources of energy. \"\n    He says the government is responsible for protecting clean air ,not protecting old and dirty  power stations. He says, \"That's the only way that we can continue to have the way of life we want without running into the wall on climate change impacts, which in turn will destroy the quality of life we have.\"\n    The EPA is now considering comments from the nationwide hearings.

Instead of waiting around for opportunities, simply take the initiative and create what we want!\"\nAfter this week, I asked for his personal e-mail address and sent him e-mail sharing my views and dreams. He kindly e-mailed back simple encouragement such as \"Keep thinking and playing bigger; it's much more fun that way. Love, Jack.\" Then I got occupied with other things in life and I stopped e-mail Jack.\nA year later, my dream gradually faded. I had this idea if I got back in touch with Jack. I e-mailed him again and again but got no response. As I sat down at my computer to check my e-mail for the fifth time in 15 minutes, an inspiration came like lighting: What was I doing? Was I waiting for the prize of life? I knew I needed to do something about all this waiting. I was going to write a book, which I would call \"Waiting for Jack\"!\nIt all sounded good, but then reality hit. Some nights I cried and wanted to give up. I wrote and rewrote. Even though I could feel the fear, I did it anyway. Fortunately, three years later, Waiting for Jack turns out a best-seller on Amazon!\nWe all have a \"Jack\" for whom we wait--whether it's a person, a place or a thing. Now I would like to ask you: what are you waiting for?"

      "A\nLike many other parts of our lives today, education has become a global enterprise. In microcosm , my school is proof of just how global. Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home."

      "Nature responds to climate change. To understand it, we need to monitor key life cycle events-flowering, the appearance of leaves the first frog calls of the spring-all around the world. But scientists can't be everywhere so they're turning to non-scientists, sometimes called citizen scientists, for help.\nA group of scientists and educators launched   an organization last year called the National Phenology Network. \"Phenology\" is what scientists call the study of the timing of events in nature.\nOne of the group's first efforts depends on scientists and non-scientists alike to collect data about plant flowering and leafing every year. The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on different kinds of common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States.\n\"People don 't have to be plant experts-they just have to look around and see what's in their neighbourhood,\"says Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser with the project, \"As we collect this data, we'll be able to predict how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes.\" \nThat data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people.\nScientists monitoring lilac   flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early - before May 20th-wildfires later in the summer and fall are larger and more severe.  _ , Jennifer says.\nImproved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change.\n\"The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have,\" he says. \"That 's why we need citizen scientists to get as much information from as many places on as many species over as long a time period as we can.\""

      "A Japanese student called Mami told me about her own experiences in Britain. She spent 10 months in the UK last year, studying English at a language school. She really enjoyed her first two weeks in the UK. But soon she started to miss things of her own country. She found it hard to make friends,and got annoyed  about local people's behaviour.  Mami said,\"After a few weeks I started to cry a lot. I felt homesick.I thought the weather was dark and too changeable,and that affected my mood as well.\"\nTo comfort herself Mami began to spend many hours on the Internet chatting with her friends back home. She spent a couple of weeks in the countryside in Kent. She went to a social club for British people who were interested in Japan and started to make some friends there. In addition,  she took a short course in calligraphy to get an opportunity of mixing with local people. A few months later,Mami's impression of the UK had greatly changed .She found that most of the British were friendly, witty and fun.\nHowever,once Mami was back in Japan,she experienced \"culture shock\"again. She said,\"I missed the friends I had made in England. My way of thinking had changed. Sometimes I was annoyed by the views of people in my country--for example,about the value of money and time.

What would be the color1 and texture of the walls, the shape of the rooms, and the quality of the light?\nCarl Jung said: \"When I was a child, I dreamed of a house shaped like a ring.Rooms would be arranged in a ring around a central courtyard, and the courtyard would have a glass roof, a steamy climate, and unusual birds. All windows in this house would look inward at the courtyard.No windows would look outward at the outside world.This was an introverted , perhaps proud, house.\nAs I aged, my dream house reshaped itself.Instead of an inner courtyard, it developed sociable porches  and big bay windows.The house of my dreams reflected who I was becoming. \"\nFor the psychologist Carl Jung, building a house was a symbol of building a self.In his autobiographical Memories, Dreams, Reflections, Jung described the gradual evolution of his home on Lake Zurich.Jung spent more than thirty years building this castle - like structure, and he believed that the towers and windows represented his soul.\nClare Cooper Marcus said, \" Can we know more about who we are by looking at where we live?\" Clare Cooper Marcus, a Professor of Architecture at the University of California in Berkeley, has written widely about the relationship between homes and the people who occupy them.Her book House as a Mirror of Self explores the meaning of \" Home\" as a place of self - expression, as a place of growing, and as a place of sociability.Marcus spent years looking at people' s drawings of memorable childhood places.\nIf the houses we live in are so significant, what about the houses we imagine?

      "The key to a good interpersonal relationship is simple once you understand the role that needs play in making a relationship weak, moderate, average, or strong.\nA person who fails in a relationship is someone who neglects the needs of his or her partner. So the first step to establish a successful relationship is to find out what needs the other person has. It is also very important to understand your own needs so that you can help the other person in the relationship to meet your needs.\nUnfortunately, not only do many people fail to see or to understand their partner's needs, but they do not understand their own. Children have wonderful relationships with their parents as long as their needs are being satisfied. When the needs are not satisfied, the relationship changes and problems arise. As a child grows, needs change; it is necessary that parents recognize these changes. As it is with the child to the parents, it is also with the parents to the child.\nThe way to recognize the needs of other people is by their responses to you. When you do or say something and you get a positive response, you are well on the way to being recognized. The same goes for you. What is it that you respond to in a positive manner? What do you feel good about getting and about doing? What are you totally guiltless about? What can you do with complete confidence and fearlessness? What emotional scene can you control without fear or guilt? Look in these areas for your needs and you will in all probability find your answers.\nAs stated, our own needs are often hidden. The techniques covered in the power of self-mind control will allow you to discover your needs and show you who you are in regard to interpersonal relationships. Your effectiveness in influencing and dealing with people will greatly increase the power of self-mind control."

      "It's midnight already, but the lights in Shi Guang's dormitory are still on. He and three other students are sitting back to back. They're all wearing earphones and staring at a computer screen, talking to each other only in words like \"charge\" or \"retreat\". Chen Jiasheng, 22, a senior majoring in electrical engineering and automation at Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics, is a gaming team leader. \" Online gaming is not just about gaming, it's a community in which we communicate with each other using our avatars ,\" said Chen. For university students like Chen, online gaming has become more than a fashion - it's part of life and a way of socializing.\nA 2012 research report on online gamers in China released by 17173.com, the country's leading game information portal, supports this concept. According to the report, university students aged between 19 and 25 make up 58 percent of online gamers, and the proportion is rising every year. \"Many of my friends spend more time hanging out in online gaming worlds than in reality,\" said Wang Jiaming, 21, a junior law major at China University of Political Sciences and Law. \"Personally I feel more powerful in virtual worlds than in real life. I'm more confident.\"\nAccording to Zhang Quan, 20, a student in the second year economics major at Renmin University of China, one of the distinguishing features of online games compared with offline games is the gaming experience. Offline games test a gamer's skill at using a keyboard to beat _ . \"Online games are technically more accessible as you don't have to master these skills,\" said Zhang.\nBut most online games are based on avatars controlled by another human - they are unavoidably more tricky and unpredictable by a computer. \"On the surface we are playing games, but actually it's real people we are dealing with,\" added Zhang. \"The only difference is that in these games we communicate with each other in different settings, like wars, magic battles and fantasy worlds.\"\nBy engaging in this interactive gaming experience, gamers become team players and promote their social skills. Chen has even made friends by playing in a team with strangers online. \"We coordinated our movements and cooperated with each other to win a battle in the cyberspace. The game was virtual but the brotherhood was real. Most of us are good friends in real life,\" said Chen."

First, more and more people have their own computers and their computers can be joined with the Internet. So it is possible for many of them to do shopping through the Internet. Second, shopping through the Internet can save them some money and a lot of time. Third, they don't need to go to the shop themselves.  Because of these good facts, few people refuse it.\nOn the other hand, some people don't like this new way of shopping. They are worried about the safety of shopping online. Customers can only see the pictures of a product on the Internet.  And they can't enjoy the pleasure of buying things in a large supermarket or a wonderful shopping center.

      "I've often wondered if I might do more good as a travel agent rather than as a psychologist. It seems that I have been more dramatically affected by certain kinds of travel experiences than I ever have.\nMy trip to Iceland is a fine example of that. The plan was to spend two days in a remote mountain hut in Iceland. I was working on a photographic book about winter in Iceland and needed to capture images of this amazing region of high mountain peaks, smoky volcanoes, and lakes with floating icebergs.\nThe moment after we arrived, the weather turned extreme making visibility impossible. It snowed so much and the wind blew so hard that we couldn't leave the tiny hut. To stay warm, we walked around in circles much of the day inside the tiny hut. We tried to call for help but the radio did not work. Day after day, we watched our supplies of food and fuel grow dangerously short. We got acute cabin fever   and started going for walks and ski expeditions outside. Even when the weather finally broke, nobody came to get us even though it was three days beyond our scheduled pickup. By the time the rescue team came to pull us out, we had all given up hope.\nFrom then on, the world looks different to me, as does my life. It would have taken me years of psychotherapy to get to the same point.\nAlmost everyone has a story to tell, and interestingly, most of these experiences were not altogether pleasant at the time. In fact, it appears that the most constructive life-changing journeys were those that involved some sorts of awful and uncomfortable events that forced the person to develop new resources, increase confidence, and solve problems in new ways."

Dictionary editors decided the words are used so commonly that they had to be defined this year.\nAnother important addition to the dictionary this year was , as in \"I  NY.\" This is the first graphic ( ) symbol ever defined in the Oxford English Dictionary.The editors added  as a verb under the definition of \"heart\", meaning \"to love\".\nSome slang words -- informal language used more commonly in speech than in writing -- were also added, like wassup, a shortened way to say \"What's up\". Even words that have been in use for many years like biker and happy camper were finally added to the dictionary.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary now defines more than 600,000 words.That adds up to more than 21,730 pages!

      "Although men and women have been growing crops for thousands of years, they have not always had enough to eat. Even today, many people in the world go hungry, and even die of hunger. If we are to grow enough for everybody, we have to grow more crops and better crops.\nPlants need the right food in order to grow. In particular, they need three chemical substances   in the soil: nitrogen  , phosphorus   and potassium  . They also need smaller amounts of other chemical substances like calcium. If there is too little of any of these substances in the soil, plants can't grow well.\nWhen a plant grows, it takes up these basic substances from the soil and builds them into itself. If we remove the plant from the soil and use it for food, we are taking some of these substances away, and this means that future plants will find less of them in the soil. In time, the soil would become too poor for plants to grow in it at all.\nTo prevent _  we must put basic substances back. One way of doing this is putting manure   on the soil. This contains the remains of plants that have been eaten, and, if we add it to the soil, we are returning some of the basic substances. In Europe and in prefix = st1 /Japan, manure from animals has for long been used in this way. Unfortunately much of the animal waste inIndiais used as fuel because there is not enough wood to burn. This means there is less manure for the crops.\nEven when we use manure, we can not put back into the soil more of the basic substances than have been taken out. Often the soil does not have enough of them in the first place, and so we must provide extra supplies. We can use chemical fertilizers  . Experiments in Indiahave shown that, if we use a fertilizer containing a mixture of nitrogen and phosphorus, we get half as much rice again from the crops on any one piece of land."

      "Emily Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts. She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, but only for one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. The people with whom she did come in contact, however, had an enormous impact on her poetry. She was particularly stirred by the Reverend Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia. While it is certain that he was an important figure in her life, it is not clear that their relationship was romantic--she called him \"my closest earthly friend.\" \nBy the 1860s, Dickinson lived in almost complete isolation from the outside world, but actively maintained many correspondences   and read widely. She spent a great deal of this time with her family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for one term. Her brother, Austin, who attended law school and became an attorney  , lived next door with his wife, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson's younger sister, Lavinia, also lived at home for her entire life in similar isolation. Lavinia and Austin were not only family, but intellectual companions for Dickinson during her lifetime. \nWhile Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\nHer first collection of poetry was published in 1890. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary techniques, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets."

Her mother bought the necklace for her on condition that she had to do some homework to pay it off. Jenny agreed. She worked very hard every day, and soon Jenny paid off the necklace. Jenny loved it so much that she wore it everywhere except when she was in the shower. Her mother had told her it would turn her neck green!\nJenny had a very loving daddy. When Jenny went to bed, he would read Jenny her favorite story.\nOne night when he finished the story, he said, \"Jenny, could you give me your necklace?\"\n\"Oh! Daddy, not my necklace!\" Jenny said. \"But you can have Rosy, my favorite doll. Remember her? You gave her to me last year for my birthday. Okay? \"\n\"Oh no, darling, that's okay.\" Her father brushed her cheek with a kiss. \"Good night, little one.\nA week later, her father once again asked Jenny for the necklace after her favorite story. \"Oh, Daddy, not my necklace! But you can have Ribbons, my toy horse. Do you remember her? She's my favorite.\"\n\"No, that's okay,\" her father said and brushed her cheek again with a kiss. \"God bless you, little one. Sweet dreams. \"\nSeveral days later, when Jenny's father came in to read her a story, Jenny was sitting on her bed and her lip was trembling. \"Here, Daddy,\" she said, holding out her hand. She opened it and her beloved pearl necklace was inside. She let it slip into her father's hand.\nWith one hand her father held the plastic pearl necklace and with the other he pulled out of his pocket a blue box.

      "Travel to China is a lifetime experience and a better way to understand China. Only when you are there, you may start to appreciate and understand what a difference to live in a nation with a population of 1.3 billion.\nChina offers variety choices for visitors. If you are interested in Chinese history, Chinese culture and Chinese scenery, your trip will be very fulfilled and very interesting. If you want to enjoy a peaceful sunshine beach holiday, there are plenty of tourist areas along the coastal line, which have unspoiled beaches and luxury hotels for visitors. In Hainan Island, the beautiful Sanya beaches are opened the whole year around and there is no winter in this island. If you want excitements and nightlife, stay in big cities. There are many places every night for international gathering. If you are adventurers, go to remote areas to watch wild life or visit minorities  to see how they live in the hillsides or desert. If you are sporty, take a cycle trip along the countryside, enjoy the rural  life and meet with Chinese people long the route.\nYou may have heard or read a lot about China from books, newspapers, magazines and TV programs. Some of them are true but most of them are out of date, incorrect or even false. China is different from many of your previous experiences and may shock you in many ways. This is what China is!\nThis country is changing and progressing every day. Yet it is still a developing country. After the economic reform, most of the developments concentrate in major cities and remote areas  are still very backward. China is a very populated nation and people have to cope with the crowded environment. Foreign visitors may not get used to the mentality of the people and sometimes become frustrated with the situation, which they never experienced before. Basically Chinese are reserve, peaceful and nice. They are very polite too but in their own way. When a foreigner is willing to take a more positive attitude to recognize the difference, the trip will become worthwhile or you may ruin your trip completely by unreasonable expectation and misjudgment of the people in general."

      "On a Saturday night at home while relaxing with friends, a dog showed up at the house. In an attempt to find the legal owner and return the dog, we knocked on the door of the legal owner and an old man opened the door. This was the start of an interesting week.\nThe old man sat down, made himself at home, and gifted us the dog. After a brief visit, he left, and we were now the proud owners of this dog. It takes experience and knowledge to know that our lifestyle can't satisfy the needs of this dog; the owner that gifted us the dog was mismatched for him as well.\nThree attempts to return the dog to his old owner failed. (I think he was avoiding us.) Because our lifestyle didn't allow us to give this poor dog the attention he needed, he disturbed the neighbors. They got involved. After we shared the story, they gained a new perspective and wisely stepped in to help us find a solution.\nOne week later it was decided that dog would be picked up from us by the old neighbor. He would then return it to the previous owner who was more equipped to care for it.\nWhen faced with unexpected challenges in life, it helps to see everyone's perspective. We have to look at one another's perspective to solve a problem with honesty, experience and knowledge. That's the sign of a leader. Although the old neighbor typically has little to do with leadership, it did bring a neighborhood together to understand one another and work as a team to solve a problem."

      "Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men--about two-thirds of both genders, yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online.\nAmerican men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.\nOnline women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.\n\"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'\" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, \"For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way.\"\nAbout two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.\nThe surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet."

      "In a recent study, participants were asked to drink beer from either a straight-sided glass, or a curved \"beer glass\". People took about almost twice as long to finish when drinking alcohol from the straight-sided glass, compared with the curved glass. There was no difference in drinking rates from the glasses when the drink was nonalcoholic.\nPeople may drink their alcohol faster from curved glasses because it is more difficult to accurately judge the halfway point of these glasses, the researchers concluded. As a result, drinkers may be less able to measure how much they have consumed. \"People often talk of 'pacing themselves' when drinking alcohol as a means of controlling levels of drunkenness, but I think the important point to take from our research is that the ability to pace effectively may be compromised when drinking from certain types of glasses,\" said study researcher Angela Attwood of the University of Bristol's School of Experimental Psychology in the United Kingdom.\nIn another experiment, participants completed a computer task in which they were shown pictures of two glasses containing varying volumes of liquid, and asked to judge whether each glass was more, or less, than half-full. The researchers found people made greater errors in judging the halfway point of the curved glass.\n\"The participants who showed the greatest error in these judgments also tended to show the greatest changes in their drinking rates,\" the researchers said. \"The speed at which people drink alcohol influences their level of intoxication  , and the number of drinks they consume on an occasion. Therefore, slowing down is likely to have a positive impact for the individual, and also at a population level.\""

      "My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag.\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October.\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients.\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice.\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes.\n\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\" I insisted. \"I can hardly do dishes in return.\"\n\"Oh, no, Lucy.\" Nicole said. \"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\"\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me.\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness.\n\"Thank you\" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate."

      "Most people will praise many technological gadgets  that they use in their everyday lives. Technology is developing at a very fast rate, and what most people did not even think could be real a few years ago is now becoming a reality. Although many will use and advertise modern technology for many of its achievements and advancements, what many don't realize is that it has affected and continues to affect society and people in general in a negative way.\nNewspaper companies, as we all know, have been hit very hard by the advancements in technology. Big newspapers have been forced to either lay off a percentage of their work force or shut down altogether because news is readily available for free on the Internet. Music does not have to be purchased at a music store any more because MP3 files are readily available on the Internet as well, thus causing big music store chains to shut their doors for good. The movie industry has also been hit hard because DVD sales have decreased since people can pay for and download their favorite movies online.\nTechnology has its benefits, but when you take a look at how people communicate with one another, you will quickly see that it has a negative impact. Modern technology has allowed people to communicate with just about anyone they want to at any given time. The fact remains that people do not _ personally with one another as often as they used to. This has created a barrier for face-to-face communication among people because they no longer have to hold a meeting in an office or they no longer have to call friends or family members together to wish them a happy birthday or congratulate them on their recent success.\nAs a result, people don't feel the urgent need to step outside of their home to find entertainment, such as participating in a dynamic game of basketball with friends, meeting a friend at a coffee shop, etc."

      "To me,life without music would not be exciting.I realize that this is not true for everybody.Many people get along quite well without going to the concert,and listening to the record. But music plays an important part in everyone's life,whether he realizes it or not.Try to imagine,for example,what films or TV plays would be like without music.Would the feelings,the moving plot,and the greatest interests,be so interesting or dramatic? I'm not sure about it.\nNow we have been speaking of music in its more common meaning--the kind of music we hear in the concert hall.We discover them in our everyday life too--in the rhythm of the sea,the _ of a bird in the woods and so on.So music surely has meaning for everyone,in some way or other.  And,of course,it has special meaning for those who have spent all their lives working on playing or writing music.\nIt is well said,\"Through music a child enters a world of beauty,expresses himself from his heart,feels the joy of doing things alone,learns to take care of others,develops his mind and makes his body strong.\""

      "In 1857 Louis Pasteur accepted a position at the Ecole Normale Superieure, a prestigious school in Paris.There, he continued the research on fermentation  that he had started earlier.\nUltimately, his research led to the process of pasteurization , which uses heat to kill harmful germs in a variety of food products.Later, Pasteur took on industry-related cases such as a disease affecting the silk industry.Beginning in 1865, Pasteur spent three years investigating the bacteria that were the culprits and developing ways to prevent their spread.\nIn 1866 Pasteur lost two daughters to typhoid fever.Two years later he became partially paralyzed as a result of grief and stress.But despite these difficulties, Pasteur pressed on to even greater accomplishments.\nIn the late 1870s, Pasteur began research in the emerging scientific field of immunization and developed a vaccine  for the deadly disease rabies.Following this success, the Pasteur Institute was founded to support Pasteur's work.Pasteur headed the institute until his death in 1895.Since then, the institute has continued to grow.Today, the institute's headquarters in Paris contain over 130 laboratories along with extensive teaching facilities and the institute's own medical center.Over the years, the institute has also extended through the establishment of around thirty research centers in other countries.At each one, researchers help local authorities monitor public health and provide medical treatment.\nUnlike many research organizations, the Pasteur Institute is not government funded.Instead it relies on financial gifts that it receives from institutions and ordinary people.This insures the institute's independence and enables it to respond quickly when health needs arise."

      "About one-third of a typical home's heat loss occurs through the doors and windows. Energy-efficient doors are insulated  and seal tightly to prevent air from leaking through or around them. If your doors are in good shape and you don't want to replace them, make sure they seal tightly and have door sweeps at the bottom to prevent air leaks. Installing insulated storm doors provides an additional barrier to leaking air. Most homes have many more windows than doors. Replacing older windows with new energy-efficient ones can reduce air leaks and utility bills. The best windows shut tightly and are constructed of two or more pieces of glass separated by a gas that does not conduct heat well. If you cannot replace older windows, there are several things you can do to make them more energy efficient. First, caulk(...) any cracks around the windows and make sure they seal tightly. Add storm windows or sheets of clear plastic to the outside to create additional air barriers. You can also hang insulated window curtain on the inside--during the winter, open them on sunny days and close them at night. During the summer, close them during the day to keep out the sun."

      "As I sat beside the window of our classroom that afternoon, my heart sank further with each passing car. This was a day I'd looked forward to for weeks: Miss Pace's fourth-grade, end-of-the-year party. I had happily volunteered my mother when Miss Pace looked for cookie volunteers. Mom's chocolate chips were well-known, and I knew they'd be a hit with my classmates. But two o'clock passed, and there was no sign of her. Most of the other mothers had already come and gone, dropping off their sweet offerings. The three o'clock bell soon took me away from my thoughts and I took my book bag from my desk. I decided I would slam the front door, and refuse to return her hug.\nBut when I arrived, she wasn't at home. I was lying face-down on my bed upstairs when I heard her come through the front door. \"Robbie,\" she called out a bit urgently. \"Where are you?\" I could then hear her rushing anxiously from room to room, wondering where I could be. I remained silent. Coming through the door, she said: \"I'm so sorry, honey,\" she said. \"I just forgot. I got busy and forgot.\" Then my mother did something completely unexpected. She began to laugh! How could she laugh at a time like this? I rolled over and faced her, ready to let her see my rage  . But my mother wasn't laughing at all. She was crying. \"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I let you down. I let my little boy down.\"\nI was moved by her tears. I tried to remember her kind words from times past when I'd skinned knees or cut myself, times when she knew just the right thing to say. \"It's okay, Mom. We didn't even need those cookies. There was plenty of stuff to eat. Don't cry. It's all right. Really.\" We didn't say another word. We just held each other. When we came to the point where I would usually pull away, I decided that, this time, I could hold on, perhaps, just a little bit longer."

Despite the obvious challenges---the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, the threat from terrorists in Nigeria----Africa's major new tendency is of a continent on the rise.\nAccording to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa's GDP growth rate of 5% over the past 15 years---almost double the global average--is expected to continue well into the next decade. Consulting film A. T. Kearney predicts that by 2040 sub-Saharan Africa would be \" the biggest, fastest, strongest and the most attractive region for retain in the world.\"\nBut the fruits of Africa's success, if not managed well, could damage this great economic and political awakening. Greater prosperity has meant Africans are living longer and healthier. At the same time, the birthrate remains high, at an average of 5.2 births per woman in Africa, compared with 1.6 in Europe and 2.1 in Asia. The young ages 15-24 make up about 37% of Africa's labor force but occupy 60% of the continent's total jobless, and a quarter of all young people haven't received any education, according to a 2011 report from the African Development Bank.\nThe young could be the engine that drives Africa for good or it could be its downfall if they deny education and opportunities. The World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab reminded Africa that 18 million jobs will have to be created every year just to _ Africa's current job seekers.\nWhat is also required is great investment in both education and employment, so that the young can start building businesses and developing the technologies to provide opportunities for the coming boom generation.

      "It was the end of my junior year, the weekend before prom  . I was riding with some friends, and a bottle was passed around the car. Everyone was taking swigs . When the bottle got to me, I thought:\"What should I do?\"I took a swig. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I had to drive home later that night.\nI went back to my car, got in and drove off. At a stop sign I saw a policeman sitting in the parking lot across the street. His headlights were turned on, and I knew he was going to follow me. Then he flashed his lights at me. All I could think was: \"Oh no, that swig!\"\nI pulled over and waited for him to come to my door. It felt like forever. \"Can I see your license and registration, please, Miss?\" I gave them to him. He took them and went back to his car for a while. When he returned, he asked if I had been drinking.\n\"No,\" I said. He asked me to step out of my car.\n\"Walk heel to toe down the white line, please.\" I passed the test. Next he had me stand on my left foot, lift my right foot and hold it for 30 seconds. I'm not the most coordinated   person and I can't even walk and chew gum at the same time, so, needless to say, I didn't pass. Then he asked me to take a breathalyzer test.\nThat was where I messed up. I told him I didn't want to and didn't understand why I had to. The officer asked me three more times, and I continued to refuse. He told me to turn around and place my hands behind my back. He arrested me right then and there.\nThe policeman drove me to a police station 20 minutes from my home. He called my parents and told them where I was.\nI went to court two months after that, charged with refusing to obey an officer. I got a $700 (4,340 yuan) fine and 40 hours of community service. I'll be on probation   for a year, and I'll have to take the driving test again. I lost my license for a whole year.\nThis was a huge learning experience for me. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to make a stupid decision. I want everyone reading this to know that it's not right to drink and drive. It definitely isn't worth losing your license over."

      "Fifteen people were killed and 38 others injured in a road accident early Wednesday morning in Enshi,Central China's Hubei Province.The bus,travelling from Wanzhou in Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality to Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong Province,had 53 passengers on board,three more than permitted.\nAt around 1 am on Wednesday,the bus increased speed gradually on a curve and plunged more than 30 metres into a valley below.Thirteen people,including one of the two drivers,died at once.Two others died on the way to hospital.\nAlthough the cause of the accident is still unclear,the local police said the driver paid no attention to the official warning signs on the expressway.It hit a section which had been closed as a result of snow.Because of the freezing weather and icy roads,the expressway had been closed by police since Tuesday morning.But the bus drivers took the dangerous route,paying no attention to the warnings.\nThe rescue team,which included more than 30 medical workers and 120 local villagers,joined together and rushed to the scene at the news of the accident.By 5 am,all of the injured had been sent to three local hospitals for emergency treatment.A hospital source said most of the patients were in a stable condition but a few were still in danger.\nAccording to a 2002 national public opinion poll,traffic accidents ranked as people's third biggest security concern."

      "While you may be doing everything right, ignoring just one or two steps in the process may keep you from getting a job, especially in this fierce market. Here is a checklist that covers some of the major links in the job-search chain.\nTHE RESUME --- Make sure it is up-to-date and tailored to the types of jobs you are seeking for. Have someone else look at your resume. If you cannot afford a career coach, give your resume to friends or family members to _ Have copies of your resume printed so that you are ready to hand them out at interviews.\nCOVERING LETTERS --- Maybe you've set up a few basic styles in advance, but that's not enough. Each covering letter should be designed to suit the job for which you are applying.\nTHE WARDROBE  --- Check your wardrobe to ensure that you have the appropriate professional dress, including shoes, ready for interview.\nNETWORKING --- Don't isolate yourself from others for days. Network through e-mail messages, phone calls, appointments and meetings keep you in touch with the outside world and prevent you from becoming depressed.\nAPPLICATION --- A glance at huge online job sites isn't usually the best way to find a job. You are more likely to succeed through the people you know via networking.\nTHE FOLLOW--UP --- It is quite common to apply for job and never hear back from the company. Take measures, such as following up with a phone call a week or so after you apply. If you know someone at the company, check whether that person will put in a good word for you.\nINTERVIEWS --- If you've got plenty of interviews but no return calls or job offers, take a look at your interviewing skills. This is one area where investing in a career coach may pay off. But if you can't afford one, try to find a job group or service that conducts free mock  interviews.\nSUPPORT SYSTEMS --- Finally, recognize that looking for job is rather difficult. Even at the best of times, a job hunt is often about rejection, and that can be hard to endure. Staying in touch with family, friends, professional networks and fellow job seekers can help you to maintain a positive attitude and a sense of perspective."

      "Washington Sightseeing Guide\nWhite House - Public tours of the White House have been offered since Thomas Jefferson was president, but you can't just drop in. Visits to the White House are in high demand, and you must make your request through your member of Congress  up to six months, and no fewer than 21 days, before your visit. Be sure to check the White House tour-info Web site to make sure about the personal identification you'll need. And before the day of your visit, call 202-456-7041 to confirm the tour schedule.\nLincoln's Cottage - Lincoln's Cottage, the hilltop home where President Lincoln lived during part of the Civil War, is simply furnished but features lighting effects and actors' recordings that reveal Lincoln's thoughts on slavery and the war. \"In the library you can actually see the ghost lines of where the library shelves would have been,\" says cottage director Erin Carlson Mast. \"We haven't re-created the bookshelves because that was such an amazing moment of discovery for us that we wanted to preserve that so people can have that moment of discovery themselves.\" \nLibrary of Congress - The Library of Congress is housed in three buildings: the Thomas Jefferson Building, James Madison Memorial Building and the John Adams Building. Although trying to see all of it in one day is possible, it's probably best to do a little thinking ahead and figure out which areas you'd really like to explore (i.e. when your feet start to hurt, you won't feel so bad about not catching everything). The most popular visitor destination is the Thomas Jefferson Building, but there are things worth seeing - murals , sculptures, performances - elsewhere in the complex."

      "The kings of ancient Egypt built strong tombs to keep their bodies safe after death and to hold their treasures. The Great Pyramid was built thousands of years ago for a king called Khufu. It is located on the west bank of Nile River not far from Cairo. In fact all the pyramids along the Nile are on its west bank. The ancient Egyptians compared the rising of the sun to the beginning of life and the setting of the sun to the end of life. This is why their dead bodies were buried on the west bank of the Nile. The people of Mexico also built pyramids. They did not build the pyramids for tombs. They used to build a pyramid and then a temple on top of it. The pyramids of Mexico are not as high as the pyramids of Egypt, but they are big. Each of the pyramids has a wide stairway that goes from the bottom to the top.\nThe biggest pyramid in Mexico is almost 2000 years old. Scientists think it took 10,000 men more than ten yeas to build it. On the top they build a temple of the sun. The temple is no longer there but people still called it the Pyramid of the Sun.Near it is another huge pyramid, the Pyramid\nof the Moon."

      "People in Britain often talk about their homes: their mortgages  , the interest rates, and rising prices. Here's a guide to some of the words and phrases you might come across.\nIt's a good idea in the UK to arrange a mortgage with a bank before you start looking. This is when the bank tells you how much money they will lend you so you have a good idea of how much you can afford.\nThe next step is to go to an estate agent and see what sort of properties they have available in your budget range and in your area. If you see something you like, the estate agent will arrange for you to view the property, so that you can see the house or flat for yourself.\nIf you see something that takes your eye, you put in an offer. The vendor   can accept or decline this offer, and if the vendor accepts it, you can move forward with the sale. However, as you don't pay any money at this point, the offer isn't legally binding  , and in theory, you can pull out of the offer at any time that you like.\nYour next step will probably be to get a structural survey done. A qualified surveyor will inspect the house and write a report that illustrates any structural problems, like damp or drainage problems.\nIf you still want to go ahead with the sale, you need to appoint a lawyer to do the legal paperwork, if you already own a house you might also be busy trying to sell it Many house owners prefer to sell to first-time buyers (those people who don't already own a home), as they are not in a chain (waiting for other people to buyer house before they can buy their next house).\nFinally, once the contracts are signed and exchanged, you complete on your house. You get the keys and you can move in whenever you want. Then you might want to throw a house-warming party. Congratulation!"

      "Soon Tommy's parents, who had recently separated, would arrive for a conference on his failing schoolwork and bad behavior. Neither parent knew that I had called the other.\nTommy, an only child, had always been happy, cooperative and an excellent student. How could I convince his father and mother that his recent failing grades represented a broken-hearted child's reaction to his parents' separation and pending   divorce?\nTommy's mother entered and took one of the chairs. Soon the father arrived. Good! At least they were concerned enough to be here in time. They ignored each other.\nAs I gave a detailed account of Tommy's behavior and schoolwork, I prayed for the right words to bring these two together to help them see what they were doing to their son. But somehow the words wouldn't come. Perhaps if they saw one of his dirty, carelessly done papers?\nI found a sheet in the back of his desk. Writing covered both sides: not the assignment, but a single sentence scribbled   over and over.\nSilently I gave it to Tommy's mother. She read it and then handed it to her husband. Then his face softened.\nAt last he folded the paper carefully, placed it in his pocket, and reached for his wife's hand. She wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled up at him. He helped her with her coat and they left together.\nIn his own way God had given me the words to reunite that family. He had guided me to the sheet of yellow copy paper covered with the pain out pouring of a small boy's troubled heart.\nThe words are \"Dear Mom...Dear Daddy... I love you...\""

      "You must have been troubled by when to say \"I love you\" because it is one of the greatest puzzles in our life.\nWhat if you say it first and your partner doesn't love you back? Or if they do say it but you don't feel they mean it? Being the first to declare your love can be never racking   and risky and can leave you feeling as vulnerable as a turtle with no shell. But is the person who says it first really in a position of weakness? Doesn't it pay to hold back, play it cool and wait until the other half has shown their hand faster?\n\"A really good relationship should be about being fair and being equal,\" says psychologist Sidney Crown. \"But love is seldom equal.\" \"All relationships go through power struggles but,\" he says, \"if a love imbalance continues for years, the rot will set in.\" That feeling of \"I've always loved you more\" may be subverted (,) for a time, but it never goes away completely and it often emerges in squabbling  . In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most powerful. \"The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings,\" says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \"The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative.\" In fact, the person who says \"I love you\" first may also be the one who says  \"I'm bored with you' first.\" Hall believes that much depends on how \"I love you\" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they're drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is \"Please don' t be unfaithful to me\" ? By saying \"I love you\", they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, wouldn't it just be more honest to say that. Collins agrees that intention is everything. \"It's not what is said, but how it's said. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker.\""

      "The American population was the tallest in the world from about the American Revolution to World WarII -- that's a long time. The U.S. had a very resource rich environment, with  _ , fish and wildlife. In fact we have data on disadvantaged people in America, such as slaves. They were obviously among the most mistreated populations in the world, but given the resource abundance,and given the fact that the slave owners needed their work, they had to be fed  ly fairly well. So the slaves were taller than European peasants. It's no wonder that Europeans were just flooding to America.\nAmericans today are no longer the tallest people in the world. After World WarII,many Western and Northern European countries began to adopt favorable social policies. There is universal health insurance in most of these societies -- that, of course, makes a difference in health care. You can also consider income inequality in the U.S., since people who are at the low end of the totem pole   have considerable adversity making ends meet. I suspect the difference in height between Americans and Europeans is due to both diet and health care.\nAmericans today suffer from an additional problem: obesity  . If children are too well nourished, then they're not able to grow best. There are certain hormones   that control the start of the adolescent   growth and the start of adolescence. Nutrition is one of the factors, along with genetic and hormonal ones which are associated with the start of puberty  . And if puberty comes too early, then the youth will peak out sooner, and will not become as tall in adulthood as someone who had better nutrition.Also, the overload of carbohydrates and fats in a fastfood diet may hinder   the consumption of micronutrients necessary to growth."

      "Some time ago,I was diagnosed with breast cancer and reacted in the way most people would.The first thing came to mind was a \"death sentence\".  However,I found out later it was truly \"an awakening\" for me,especially after being diagnosed with colon cancer a few years later,but still alive to tell about them both.I began to question God.Why was I chosen to suffer this double challenge?What had I done in life so bad to have this placed upon me?I was unhappy with the way I look and the intolerant pain I had to experience each day,but instead of sighing over my fate,I decided to look on the positive sides of it.\nI knew that I was about to face a new beginning,new hope,do and see more with a whole new perspective on life.I also began thinking of the individuals that are no longer among us and how there will always be someone worse off than I am.Who am I to complain?I still have my life.\nDuring my treatments,I experienced something of a miracle that I had to write down.I took that experience and turned it into a poem and I called it \"Peace\".I took that poem along with many others I had composed during my breast cancer period and submitted them for publication.The book of poems was accepted and published under the title \"True Simple Poems of Life,Faith and Survival\".\nI continue to write and hope that my poetry may encourage other unfortunate people and my writing continues to give me strength.I've had another inspirational children's book published called \"If Only I Could Fly,Said Mattiebee\".\nI would never have become a writer,producing inspirational stories,if I had not gone through all that I did.I'm a true example that you can survive cancer,not once,but twice,providing that you catch it in time.It won't all be easy,but you must have faith and allow that faith to direct your path.\nI truly believe when you survive a terrible tragedy or a horrible disease like cancer,it's for a reason--you have a purpose,and I want to live and find out exactly what that is for me."

      "\"Time is a problem for children,\" states a news report for a new Swiss watch. Children in some countries \"learn time slowly\" because \"they don't wear watches\" and \"parents don't really know how to teach them time.\" The children grow up with this _ and become adults-and then can't get to work on time. Is there an answer to this problem? Of course-it's the Flick Flak, made by a famous Swiss watch company.\nThe Flick Flak is being marketed as something teaching watch for children aged 4 to 10. The watch itself does not teach children how to tell time, of course; it merely \"takes their imagination\" by presenting the \"hour\" hand as a beautiful red girl named Flak and the \"minute\" hand as a tall blue boy named Flick. Flick points to related \"blue\" minutes on the dial, while Flak points to \"red\" hour numbers. The characters and colors combined with parental help, are supposed to teach young children how to tell time.\nThe watch comes equipped with a standard battery and a nylon band  . Peter Lipkin, the United States sales manager for the Flick Flak, calls it \"childproof: if it gets dirty you can throw the whole watch in the washing machine.\" The product is being sold in select department stores in Europe, Asia and the United States for a suggested price of $25. Parents who buy the watch may discover that it is one thing to tell time; it's quite another for them to be on time."

      "I had worried myself sick over Simon's mother coming to see me. I was a new teacher, and I gave an honest account of the students' work. In Simon's case,the grades were awfully low. He couldn't read his own handwriting. But he was a bright student. He discussed adult subjects with nearly adult comprehension. His work in no way reflected his abilities.\nSo when Simon's mother entered the room, my palms   were sweating. I was completely unprepared for her kisses on both my cheeks. \"I came to thank you,\" she said, surprising me beyond speech. Because of me, Simon had become a different person. He talked of how he loved me, he had begun to make friends, and for the first time in his twelve years, he had recently spent an afternoon at a friend's house. She wanted to tell me how grateful she was for the self-respect I had developed in her son. She kissed me again and left.\nI sat, stunned, for about half an hour,wondering what had just happened. How did I make such a life changing difference to that boy without even knowing it?What I finally came to remember was one day, several months before,when some students were giving reports in the front of the class, Jeanne spoke quietly,and to encourage her to raise her voice, I had said, \"Speak up. Simon's the expert on this. He is the only one you have to convince, and he can't hear you in the back of the room.\" That was it. From that day on, Simon had sat up straighter, paid more attention, smiled more,and became happy. And it was all because he happened to be the last kid in the last row. The boy who most needed praise was the one who took the last seat that day.\nIt taught me the most valuable lesson over the years of my teaching career, and I'm thankful that it came early and positively.

      "The best way to come first is to go last. An analysis of almost 50 years of competitions--including Eurovision Song Contests and world skating championships--has found that contestants are more likely to win if they are among the last to appear before the judges. \n  The study by an American university appears to provide scientific proof that the best man, or woman, does not always win. \n  It found that, on average, the last competitor to appear in the Eurovision Song Contest was more than twice as likely to win as the one who went on first. \n  The first rounds of figure-skating championships, for which the running order is selected at random, showed more dramatic results. The final skater had a 14 percent chance of victory, making him or her more than four times as likely to win as the first skater. \n  The study showed a gradual _ of chances for competitors who appeared earlier in the running order. A contestant who appears first in a contest is two percent less likely to win than one who appears second. A contestant who appears second is two percent less likely to win than one who appears third, and so on.\n  The findings are published in the March issue of Acta Psychologica, a scientific journal.\n  Robert Hardman, a senior lecturer in psychology at London Metropolitan University who specializes in the science of decision-making, said that the results were interesting. He suggested that the effect was caused by the limitations of the human memory. \n  \"When people make comparisons, they aren't really able to make a lot of fine-grade discrimination. When contestants appear at the beginning of a contest, judges have little to compare them to and are perhaps wary  of the scores they give,\" he said. \n  \"Later on, when judges are able to compare the contestants to those that have gone before, they might give more extreme marks because they feel more confident about their judgments.\""

      "It is true that people with better education are usually able to get better paying jobs. In other words, they have more chances to choose a good job while people with little or no education don't. It seems that the purpose of education is to make people get jobs. But this isn't accepted by all people.\nSome people may think that a person should spend the best years of his life to get education only for a way of living. This was probably one of the earliest reasons of education. In fact, if education is just a way of making a living, people don't need to spend so much time in school. People can get education for a living in a short time. Subjects like history and geography need not be taught to everyone. Even language and mathematics need not be taught in detail , either. Here it is clear that education is much more than teaching a man to get a way of living.\nEducation is well-rounded and it is mainly for improving a man. It is not only to teach him to speak, read and write, but also to develop his creative thinking and other abilities. After that, it is to make him a wise man and thankfully enjoy the achievements of human. Education is to make a man lead a better life. Educated people are expected to be able to listen to good music, read good books, watch plays and most of them take an interest in the world.\nI would agree that making a good living is an important reason for education, but certainly not the most important or the main reason."

      "The Beatles were the most influential band in pop history. In their 8year, 12album history, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr altered   popular culture dramatically. And it wasn't just the suits and changing lengths of hair the four Liverpool boys wore that had such an impact, but what they seemed to stand for. The world saw them as the voice of a new generation, one with a very different attitude to life.\n Their influence was at its height in the 1960s, but their music continues to stir listeners today. However, up until recently one aspect of the Beatles was struck in Yesterday: The music had never been remastered  . But on September 9 that situation came to an end, with the release of the entire band's music in a digital makeover. It is probably the biggest reissue   in pop music history, said British newspaper theFinancialTimes.\n The albums were remastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, the location where the band produced much of their work. The cover of their last album, AbbeyRoadof1969, featured the four young men striding   across a zebra crossing on Abbey Road itself. It is one of the most famous of all Beatles images.\n Recently, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album, hundreds of Beatles lovers gathered there to show their appreciation.\n Pop groups come and go. The boy band pursued by screaming fans one year will be forgotten the next. But the Beatles are one of the few groups whose music seems to have endured  . Why? Paul McCartney's biographer Barry Miles has an explanation: \"They were the first rock band... and they just happened to be the best. They were the first band to play stadiums, to have their own products. They were groundbreaking in every way,\" he says."

      "Although there is no formal process of selection, in larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment .\nAlthough leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades  of research have failed to produce evidence that there are any \"natural leaders\". It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; or rather, any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.\nResearch suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \"get things done\". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.\nInstrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group's goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect."

      "Governments all over the world make public reports about the condition of their economies. Most countries, including the United States, have used a measure called the gross national product  or GNP. It includes all goods and services produced by citizens of the country anywhere in the world.\nRecently the American Commerce Department has started using a new method to measure production. It is known as the gross domestic product or GDP. It counts only goods and services that have been produced within the nation's borders. Money earned by foreign companies operating in the United States is included in the GDP, but money earned by American companies operating in other countries is not.\nEconomic experts generally approve of the change. They say that the gross domestic product provides a truer measure of the economy. They also note that most other industrial countries use this method. Therefore it will be easier to study the economies of different countries. Some officials also hope the new system will help them make better economic policy decisions. It will provide them with a clearer understanding of economic activity in the U.S. . The new measure is less likely to be affected by sudden changes in foreign oil prices or in the value of the American dollar in other countries.\nEconomic experts believe that the change from GNP to GDP will immediately reduce the value of American production by at least 40,000 million dollars a year. But that is really a very small change in the American economy - less than 1% . The Commerce Department reports the unofficial gross domestic product once every three months. The government also continues to report GNP as it has four times a year since 1941."

Ever since then, he has been an extremely happy second-grader. He is very typical of a nine-year-old. He likes to tell jokes, play new games, and he likes to play tricks on people, just like children at his age. I love spending time with him. We go to movies whenever there is a good one and look after him every chance I get.\nI say that Marcus helps to appreciate the simple thing in life. He doesn't have his sight and that causes me to realize how lucky I am to be able to see, to walk, and to talk. I can do everything I need to.

      "Weekends are normally a time for shopping and last Saturday was no exception. My son Henry and I were shopping in a neighborhood market. Henry was busy weighing each new bag of vegetables I selected. I gave him a bag of potatoes and he walked over to the scale and waited in line. Suddenly, a man rushed over from behind, and stepped before him, hitting him out of the way. Henry looked shocked and scared. Seeing this I left my shopping cart and walked over to Henry, saying loudly, \"Are you OK, honey? I saw what that man did to you. That was very, very wrong.\"\nWhen the man finished weighing his bag, his sudden turning around made all his onions fall to the ground. The three of us stood there, frozen for a moment. And then I bent down on my hands and knees and started collecting onions. After I handed the onions to the man, he accepted them and put them into his bag. After Henry and I picked up all the onions, the man walked away without saying anything. We didn't discuss the event until we got back in the car.\nOn the way back home, Henry said through tears, \"Mommy, I've a frustrating day. That man cut right in front of me. And we had to help him pick up his onions! Why did we do that? That didn't make any sense!\"\nI took a deep breath and said, \"Henry, that man seemed to have a very bad mood today. We should forgive him. I was also angry with the man for treating you rudely. I really wanted to kick him. But doing that doesn't make any sense. If we hadn't helped him, we might have felt good for a moment, but then I bet we would have felt really sorry for a long time. You and I have a lot of love to share. Maybe that man doesn't have much. People who behave badly still need love.\"\nA cheerful smile appeared on Henry's face. It was a smile of promise kept. It was the best smile I had ever seen. It was a good moment. It may have been my best mommy moment ever."

      "The British National Health Service (NHS) was set up in 1948 and was designed to provide equal basic health care, free of charge, for everybody in the country. Before this time health care had to be paid for by individuals.\nNowadays central government is directly responsible for the NHS although it is administered by local health authorities. About 83 percent of the cost of the health service is paid for by general taxation and the rest is met from the National Insurance contributions paid by those in work. There are charges for prescription and dental care but many people, such as children, pregnant women, pensioners, and those on Income Support, are exempt from payment.\nMost people are registered with a local doctor (a GP, or General Practitioner) who is increasingly likely to be part of a health centre which serves the community.\nAs the population of Britain gets older, the hospital service now treats more patients than before, although patients spend less time in hospital. NHS hospitals--many of which were built in the nineteenth century--provide nearly half a million beds and have over 480, 000 medical staff. The NHS is the biggest employer in Europe although Britain actually spends less per person on health care than most of her European neighbours.\nDuring the 1980s there was considerable restructuring of the Health Service with an increased emphasis on managerial efficiency and the privatization of some services (for example, cleaning). At the end of the 1980s the government introduced proposals for further reform of the NHS, including allowing some hospitals to be self-governing, and encouraging GPs to compete for patients. Patients would be able to choose and change their family doctor more easily and GPs would have more financial responsibility. The political questions continue of how much money should be provided to support the NHS and where it should come from."

      "Warren Buffett , probably the world's most successful investor , has said that anything good that happened to him could be traced back to the fact that he was born in the right country , the United States , at the right time (1930) . In 1988 , when The World light-heartedly ranked 50 countries according to where would be the best place to be born in 1988 , America indeed came top . But which country will be the best for a baby born in 2015 ?\nTo answer this , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) , has this time turned deadly serious . It attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy , safe and prosperous life in the years ahead . Its quality-of-life index links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys - how happy people say they are - to objective determinants of the quality of life . Being rich helps more than anything else , but it is not all that counts ; things like crime , trust in public institutions and the health of family life matter too . In all , the index takes 11 significant factors into account .\nDespite the global economic crisis , times have in certain respects never been so good . Output growth rates have been decreasing across the world , but income levels are at or near historic highs , Life expectancy continues to increase steadily and political freedoms have become better known across the globe .\nWhat does all this mean for where a baby might be luckiest to be born in 2015 ? After calculation , the EIU has Switzerland comfortably in the top spot , with Australia second . Small economies occupy the top ten . Half of these are European , but only one , the Netherlands , is from the euro zone . The largest European economies ( Germany , France and Britain ) do not do particularly well . America , where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation , stays in 16th place . Among the 80 countries covered , Nigeria comes last .\nSome people will , of course , find more holes in all this than there are in a big Swiss cheese . For example , in the film \" The Third Man \" , Harry Lime famously says that Italy for 30 years had war , terror and murder under the Borgias but in that time produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance ; Switzerland had 500 yeas of peace and democracy -- and produced clocks and watches .\nHowever , there is surely a lot to be said for birth stability in today's uncertain times ."

      "Two men, Alan and Henry, both seriously ill, shared a hospital room. Alan was allowed to sit up in his bed and his bed was next to the room's only window. Henry had to spend all his time flat on his back.\nThe men talked for hours, of their wives, families, their homes and their jobs. And every afternoon when Alan, in the bed next to the window, could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Lovers walked arm in arm among flowers. Trees and skyline could be seen in the distance. As he described all this, Henry, on the other side of the room, would close his eyes and imagine the scene.\nOne warm afternoon Alan described a parade   passing by. Although Henry could not hear the band, he could see it in his mind. Unexpectedly, an _ though: entered his head: why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything while I never got to see anything? It doesn't seem fair. Henry felt ashamed at first. But as the days passed and he missed seeing more sight, his envy grew and soon let him down. He began to find himself unable to sleep. He should be by that window ---- and that thought now controlled his life.\nLate one night, as he lay staring at the ceiling. Alan began to cough. He was choking. Henry watched in the dim room as the struggling man tried hard to reach for the button to call for help. Listening from across the room, he never moved, never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running. In less than five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped, along with the sound of breathing. Now, there was only silence ---- deathly silence.\nAs soon as it seemed appropriate, Henry asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.\nSlowly, painfully, he struggled to take his first look. Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it all himself. He looked out, but faced a black wall."

      "I was raised on a farm in the Fraser Valley along with five sisters and one brother. When I was 15, I got addicted to drinking at weekends and then dropped out of school. By the time I was 17, I continued to drink heavily. I couldn't find a job to support myself. So, I had no other choice but to join the army. I retired and went back home three years later, still a heavy drinker. When I was 22, I met Sue whose father was also a heavy drinker, so my behavior didn't surprise her. We were soon married and later had two daughters.\nI started my first business when I was in my mid-twenties. A few years later, I bought a large chicken farm. Even with this success, though, my drinking was always a problem. It affected my marriage and family so much that I knew I had to make up my mind to stop drinking. So I tried great efforts. But two years later, I began drinking again.\nWhen I was in my mid-thirties, I sold both of my businesses, and bought the big house on the hill. I was not at all happy, although I had everything that was supposed to make me happy. I sold our big house on the hill and bought a large land, where I built a new house. Our marriage was in big trouble, and my finances would _ . For the first time in many years, I had to go to work for someone as an employee. I took a job as a heavy equipment operator in a road building camp.\nMy marriage still came apart when I was 38, and my kids had to go through our divorce. I spent 6 months in giving up drinking on a school camp. Nearly a year later, I met my childhood neighbor girl, June. We were married not long afterwards. My kids learned to trust me again and I have two stepchildren that also love me.\nHappy life continued about ten years. Everything was going so well when I felt there was something wrong with my body. I went to see a doctor, and the medical examination came out that I had ALS . Record shows that people with ALS generally survive between two to five years after symptoms appear. I've probably had the symptoms for one-and-a-half years already, so I don't know how much time I have left....God knows..."

      "Sir William Osler has a few words for you: \"In the Life of a young man, the most essential thing for happiness is the gift of friendship.\" Truer words were never spoken. For what more could you ask than comradeship during the peaks and valleys of life? To whom else but a close, valuable friend can you show off your successes and complain about your failures or losses?\nWhat is a \"good friend\"? How is he best described? Well, it has been my observation that although many will cry with you, few can sincerely rejoice   with you. Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet. Much other matters far more: relying, sharing, giving, getting, enjoying; a sympathetic ear always there; criticism when it can help; praise -- even if only because it would help. With not many people on this earth will you find this much in common. When you find one, hang on to him, for a good friend found is a rare treasure."

More than 215 million people now call America \"home'',but most of them can trace their families back to other parts of the world.If you look at the names on shop windows,you will see that Americans come from many different lands.The idea that these people,who once were strangers to the United States, have lost the customs and cultures of their original countries and have become \"American''is really not true. In fact,what exists in America is more often a kind of \"side-by-side'' living in which groups of people from other countries often have kept many of their customs and habits. They join the general American society only in certain areas of their lives--such as in schools,business,and sports-but they keep many of their own native customs and manners socially and at home.This living \"side-by-side\"has both advantages and disadvantages.Sometimes it may cause disagreements to develop between  groups whose ways of life are very different from one another.However, there are also great advantages that come from the variety of cultures brought by settlers from other lands.There is great freedom of choice among ideas and dress,food,and social customs in America.Everyone can find some part of his or her familiar world in the United States, in Churches,music,food,national groups,or newspapers."

      "The size of the British Isles often leads people to think that the languages spoken in its countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat the same. At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.\nExperts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent. Both the words and the pronunciation of an individual reflect his or her social position.\nIt is agreed that in England, the kind of English spoken by a person plays a leading role that generally is not important in North America. The importance of accents and their cultural and social relationships are well represented in films and on television in Britain. The film My Fair Lady based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion is often said to be a wonderful example of how social class and the accent were, and still are, linked in Britain."

      "I clearly remember my mom telling me to drink milk every day--one glass in the morning and another at night. I also remember loving it while my sister thought quite the opposite--she would _ pour her milk into the sink or water the plants with it! I guess I should thank my mom for making us drink a lot of milk, so rich in calcium , during those important years.\nToday, calcium shortage is one of the main concerns of women in their 30s or even early 20s. The great fear is that when we reach our 50s or 60s, osteoprosis will set in. That is why you can see a lot of advertisements for products supposedly containing a lot of calcium.\nBecause calcium is not that easy to acquire from the food we normally eat, busy women these days should take calcium supplements . There are a lot of different forms of these---calcium carbonate ,oyster shell or bone-meal-based calcium supplements.\nYou have to be careful when choosing which kind to take. This is because calcium is not easily absorbed by the body. So the fact that you are taking supplements doesn't mean that the body is actually benefiting from them. Different supplements may have different instructions on dosage and manner of intake. You can ask your doctor to help you determine which supplement is the best for your needs."

      "It is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more. But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses."

      "A sandstorm, also known as a dust storm, is exactly what it sounds like. A very strong windstorm especially in the desert carries clouds of sand or dust that greatly reduces visibility. This wind is usually caused by convection currents  , which are created by intense heating of the ground, and is usually strong enough to move entire sand dunes. Air is unstable when heated, and this instability in the air will cause higher winds to mix with winds in the lower atmosphere, producing strong surface winds.\nSandstorms can disturb people's travel, and can sometimes destroy whole roads, and dry flat areas. Similar dust storms can be found on the planet Mars, and are thought to be seasonal. Today, the destruction of forests and too much farming of farmland can lead to sandstorms. Too much use of water resources can also cause sandstorms.\nIn the United States of America, sandstorms are rare because of the lack of large deserts and more importantly the development of proper agricultural techniques. The last recorded destructive sandstorm in American history was the Dust Bowl, which occurred on July 16, 1971 and was widely recorded by meteorologists  .\nTo protect themselves from sandstorms, some people wear protective suits. Special equipment can be fixed in some cars to prevent sand from getting into the engine. Sandstorms can cause coughs, and the sand and dust has also been known to carry \"infectious diseases\". Sand particles, unlike dust ones, will block air passages, and cause a person who breathes them in to choke. Dust particles may cause an allergic   reaction."

      "It's never a real problem for us when the weather gets cold. We can put on more clothes, stay next to a fireplace, turn on the air conditioner or simply travel to a warmer city to spend the winter - people have many different ways of dealing with the cold.\nBut things are not as easy for plants. Unlike humans, plants can't move to escape the cold or generate heat ( ) to keep themselves warm. So how do they manage to survive the freezing winter?\nIt turns out that plants have their own strategies   too, said a study published on Dec 22 in the journal Nature.\nAccording to researcher Amy Zanne of George Washington University, US, the cold is a big challenge for plants. Their living tissues   can be damaged when they freeze. \"It's like a plant's equivalent to frostbite ( ),\" Zanne told Science Daily. Also, the process of freezing and thawing    can cause air bubbles   to form in the plant's water transport system. \"If enough of these air bubbles come together as water thaws they can block the flow of water from the roots to the leaves and kill the plant,\" she explained.\nTo live through cold weather, plants have developed three traits   , according to the study. Some plants, such as oak trees , avoid freezing damage by dropping their leaves before the winter chill sets in - effectively shutting off the flow of water between roots and leaves - and growing new leaves and water transport cells when the warm spring returns.\nOther plants, pine trees  for example, protect themselves by narrowing their water transport cells, which makes it easier for cells to travel among air bubbles.\nThe third strategy is also the most extreme - some plants die on the ground in winter and start growing as new plants from seeds when conditions get warmer.\nHowever, the study also found that these smart strategies were developed very slowly - over millions\nof years of evolution ( ). This leads scientists to worry that plants may not be able to deal with human-caused climate change, which has only started occurring over the past few decades.\nScientists are hoping that this study can help people find possible ways to save plants from the threat\nof climate change."

      "It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997, to support the Red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines. Within hours of arriving in Angola, television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines. \"I knew the statistics,\"she said. \"But putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me; like when I met Sandra, a 13- year-old girl who had lost her leg, and people like her.  \"\nThe Princess concluded with a simple message. \"We must stop landmines.\" And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message.  \nBut, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as very \"ill-informed\"and \" a loose cannon  .\"  \nThe Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,\" This is a distraction   we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\"  \nOpposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government.  \nTo try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.   \nFor the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause. She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people and their problems."

      "Let us take a serious look at what the results might be if such a suggestion were accepted. Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.\nOn evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.\nWith free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.\nAt first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball."

      "Alexis De Tocqueville,the French political scientist,,historian,philosopher and politician.Is most famous for a four-volume book he wrote called Democracy in America.He came to America in 1831 to study the American form of democracy'and what it might mean to the rest of the world.After a visit of only nine months,,he wrote a remarkable book which is regarded as a classic.De Tocqueville had unusual powers of observation.He described not only the democratic system of government and how it operated,but also its effect on how Americans think, feel, and act, Many scholars believe he had a deeper understanding of traditional American beliefs and values than anyone else who has written about. the United States.What is so remarkable is that\nmany of these characteristics which he observed nearly 200years ago are still visible and\nmeaningful today.His observations are also important because the timing of his visit,the 1830s,was before America was industrialized.This was the era of the small farmer,the small businessman,and the settling of the western frontier.It was the period of history when the traditional values of the new country were newly established.In just a generation,some 40 years since the adoption of the U.S:Constitution.the new form of government had--already produced a society of people with unique values.He was,however,a fair observer and saw both the good and bad sides of these qualities.\nThe first part of Democracy m America was written in 1831--32 and published in 1835.A highly positive and optimistic account of American government and society,the book was very well received.He attempted to get a glimpse of the core of American society.all the while promoting his own philosophy:the equaling of the classes and the unavoidable depth of aristocratic privilege The rest of the book he labored on for four years.and in 1840 the second part was published.This was substantially more pessimistic than the first,warning of the dangers despotism  and governmental centralization,and applying his ideas and criticisms more directly to France.As a result, it was not received as well as the first part,except in England where it was highly thought of."

      "So you're between the ages of 13 and 24. What makes you happy?\n    A worried, weary parent might imagine the answer to sound something like this: Sex, drugs, a little rock 'n' roll  . Maybe some cash, or at least the car keys.\n    It turns out the real answer is quite different. Spending time with family is the top answer to that open-ended question, according to an extensive survey--more than 100 questions asked of 1,280 people ages 13-24 -- conducted by The Associated Press and MTV on the nature of happiness among America's young people.\n    Next is spending time with friends, followed by time with a significant other. And even better for parents: Nearly three quarters of young people say their relationship with their parents makes them happy.\n   \"They're my foundation,\" says Kristiana St.John, 17, a high-school student from Queens in New York. \"My mom tells me that even if I do something stupid, she's still going to love me no matter what. Just knowing that makes me feel very happy and blessed.\"\n    You might think money would be clearly tied to a general sense of happiness. But almost no one says \"money\" when asked what makes them happy, though people with the highest family incomes are generally happier with life. However, having highly educated parents is a stronger predictor of happiness than income.\n    From the body to the soul: Close to half say religion and spirituality are very important. And more than half say they believe there is a higher power that has an influence over things that make them happy. Beyond religion, simply belonging to an organized religious group makes people happier.\nAnd parents, here's some more for you: Most young people in school say it makes them happy. Overwhelmingly  , young people think marriage would make them happy and want to be married some day. Most also want to have kids.\nFinally, when asked to name their heroes, nearly half of respondents mentioned one or both of their parents. The winner, by a nose: Mom."

      "In high school, George Lucas didn't do much work because he spent all his time dreaming about racing cars.\nJust a few days before graduation, George was driving home from the library in his Fiat; he prepared for a left turn by looking in the minor. But as he started the turn, he heard the sound of another car, a blowing horn , and the speeding Chevy hit the driver side of his car. The little Fiat turned over four or five times before it was stopped by a big tree. Luckily, George did not die in the accident, but his recovery was slow and he needed months of physical treatment. He would never be able to race ears now.\nThe accident really changed George's life. He decided there must be some reason he survived, and made up his mind to get his act together and make something out of his life. He decided to go to university and developed an interest in reading and writing. He got on quite well in his studies. He didn't quite forget about racing cars. At that time instead of driving race cars, he began filming them.\nYou may have seen one or all of George Lucas's most famous films from the Star Wars series or the Indiana Jones trilogy. Not only has George produced movies, but also he has helped invent and develop new technologies to modernize the movie industry.\nToday, Lucas, who earns as much as $3.0 billion, is one of the American film industry's most successful directors and producers."

Instead, people will choose a program from a \"menu\" and a computer will send the program directly to the television. Today, we can use the World Wide Web to read newspaper stories and see pictures on a computer thousands of kilometers away. By 2050, music, films, programs, newspapers, and books will come to us by computer.\nCars will run on new, clean fuels and they will go very fast. Cars will have computers to control the speed and there won't be any accidents. Today, many cars have computers that tell drivers exactly where they are. By 2050, the computer will control the car and drive it to your destination. Space planes will take people halfway around the world in 2 hours. Today, the United States Space Shuttle can go into space and land on Earth again. By 2050, space planes will fly all over the world and people will fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo in just 2 hours.\nRobots will have replaced people in factories. Many factories already use robots. Big computers prefer robots--they don't ask for pay rises or go on strike, and they work 24 hours a day. By 2050, we will see robots everywhere--in factories, schools, offices, hospitals, shops and homes.\nMedical technology will have conquered many diseases. Today, there are devices that connect directly to the brain to help people hear. By 2050, we will be able to help blind and deaf people to see and hear again.\nScientist will have discovered how to control genes . Scientists have already produced clones of animals. By 2050, scientists will be able to produce clones of people, and decide how they look, how they behave and how clever they are. Scientists will be able to do these things, but should they?"

      "When in doubt, cut that out! Yeah, yea, Doubting Thomas may have had a point in his day, and life may not be what you want it to be, but if you constantly doubt yourself, how can you accomplish anything?\nWhere is your confidence? What possible good can come from taking the negative aspect of any situation and growing it into acceptance?\nPurpose of achievement is to attain a goal. So, if you set your goals and strive to get there, it should be assumed that you are moving toward your goal no matter what you are doing, right?\nWhen watching a football game, one of those great high school starter games, set to determine who starts when the real games begin, I noticed the coach called \"defense\" only when the team was \"protecting\" their goal. As long as the team was fighting for more ground they played \"offense  \". Along the same lines, I've heard the phrase, \"a strong defense requires a good offense.\" Simply put, if you concentrate more on gaining ground than on protecting your goals, your accomplishments will be greater. Time spent protecting your goals is wasted time, when you could be working toward attaining your goals rather than preventing others from reaching their goal.\nIn business, if you waste your time focusing on what your competitor is doing rather than working toward meeting your goals, you won't get very far.\nFocus your attention on where you're going. Don't waste time worrying about where your competition is. You will gain ground while they are watching you. Smile as you reach your destination."

      "Any list of the world's top ten most famous paintings will surely include da Vinci's Mona Lisa.Part of the painting's attraction is its mystery .\nThose lucky enough to have a view of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre often stare in awe , surprised by the smile that seems to flicker .Staring at a reproduction of the work produces the same effect.Now she's smiling, then she's not.\nWhat's the deal with Mona Lisa's smile?\nHarvard scientist Margaret Livingstone is pretty sure she's solved the puzzle.After careful studies on human brains, Livingstone reasoned that the famous painting's flickering smile is caused by the way human beings see.\nOur eyes use two separate regions  to see.One is central vision(;), used to see colors and pick out details such as fine print.The other is the vision around, used to observe lights, shadows, black and white contrasts.\nWhen we look at a person's face, according to Livingstone, we usually focus centrally on the eyes.Staring at Mona Lisa's eyes, our less accurate vision notices the mouth, picking up shadows from the cheekbones.The shadows play tricks, looking like a smile.But when we look directly at the mouth, our central vision doesn't see the shadows, and so the smile suddenly disappears.As our eyes observe different parts of the painting, Mona's smile seems to show up or disappear.\nDid da Vinci intend to create this flickering smile effect? Perhaps.In any case, he was talented enough to paint shadows so good as to puzzle viewers for centuries.Meanwhile, Mona Lisa will keep smiling.And not."

      "Thousands of people began pouring into Pennsylvania from other states. They wanted to buy lottery tickets. The tickets cost only $0.9 each. But that small spending could bring them a reward of $90 million. That was the second largest lottery jackpot in history.\nMore than 87 million tickets were bought for the Pennsylvania lottery drawing. Those who bought tickets had to choose seven numbers from 1 to 80. The chance of winning was one in 9.6 million. But that little chance certainly didn't affect ticket sales. In the last few days before the drawing, tickets were selling at the unbelievable rate of 500 per second.\nExperts say many people buy lottery tickets because they just want to have a piece of the action. Others say the lottery is a stock market for poor people. It allows them to dream about wealth they'll probably never have.\nBut many people believe lotteries are no better than legalized  gambling. Some critics note that most people who play are poor and may not be able to afford the tickets. There are also many addicts who take the game seriously. They may pour their life savings into lottery tickets. Some clubs have been formed to help them kick the habit.\nPoliticians like lotteries because they provide money that would otherwise have to come from new taxes. The profits from lotteries are usually used to pay for education or programs for senior citizens. But critics say this arrangement just allows states to legalize vice , under the name of social progress.\nNo matter whether you regard state lotteries right or not, you cannot refuse to accept their extreme popularity with many Americans."

She began studying medical reports in the library and found an article in a magazine about a well-known heart doctor. Dr. Michael DeBekey of Houston, Texas. He had saved the life of someone with the same illness. The article said Dr. DeBekey's fees were very high; Aunt Edith couldn't possible pay them. But could he tell her of someone whose fee she could pay?\n       So Aunt Edith wrote to him. She simply listed her reasons for wanting to live her three children who would be on their own in three or four more years, and among them a little girl always dreamed of traveling and seeing the world. There wasn't a word of self-pity, only warmth and humor and the joy of living. She mailed the letter, not really expecting an answer.\n       A few days later, my doorbell rang.

      "The summer beach season is prime time for shark attacks. It seems like sharks are attacking all the time .But that is something of an illusion. The number of attacks is very small.\nHow does a shark hunt? Muscles and fins  give the shark its speed and maneuverability in the water. A shark's front fins act like the wings of a plane and let it \"fly\" through the water. The tail acts like a high-power propeller .\nBut the big thing that gives the shark its edge in the ocean is its sensory package. The package includes the shark' eyes ,ears ,skin, nose and mouth, as well as electric sensing.\nA shark' nose is probably its most important sense.  If you were to put a single drop of blood in a swimming pool ,a great white shark could smell that. And they can tell the direction that the smell is coming from.\nSharks handle their electric sensing using cell located in the head .Whenever something moves using its muscles , a shark can detect the electrical impulses flowing to those muscles. A shark can electrically \"see\" anything that has muscles even if it is hiding or the water is not clear.\nSharks even have vibration sensors in their skin. Even something moves near  the shark ,tubes pick up the pressure changes and hairs inside the tubes send signals to the brain . This extra sense allows a shark to turn quickly and attack again.\nWhen you put all these different senses together ,it makes the shark a nearly ideal hunter. A shark can detect prey from miles away and then use eyes ,electrosensing and movement sensing to home in .\nStrangely, sharks do not seem to use these senses to\npeople. The very low number of sharks tells us that sharks do not hunt people on a regular basis. On the other hand , people love to hunt sharks. Millions of sharks die every year. Without protection ,extinction is a definite possibility."

      "When I was in my fourth year of teaching, I was also (and am still) a high school track and field coach  . One year, I had a student, John,  who entered my class when he was a junior  . John changed to our school from Greece, and seemed to be interested in athletics, so I encouraged him to join our track team. I explained to him that even though he had never taken part in it before, I did believe that he could do well in any event, and I would be willing to coach him at whichever ones interested him. He accepted the offer, and began to work hard at every practice.\nAbout a month later, I had found out from other sources that John was a first-class tennis player, winning various junior awards in his home country. I went to him asking, \"John, I really appreciate that you came out for the track team, but why didn't you play tennis instead? It seems that would interest you a lot more, since you're so good at it.\"\nJohn answered, \"Well, I like tennis, but you told me that you believed in me, and that you thought I could do well in track, so I wanted to try it for that reason.\"\nFrom then on, I often remember my student's reply. I told it to a friend and she suggested I write it down to share somewhere with more teachers. No matter how critical   students can be of themselves, I've found that a simple \"I trust that you can do it!\" can go a long way!"

It's about an Italian immigrant who goes to America , but he becomes a failure.\n\"In many ways it's very close to my life the way the story has been written,\" said Bennett. \"My father, an Italian ,was ill and died when I was nine.

      "To many students, high school is just a basic routine. You go to class in the morning, take a break for lunch and go home in the afternoon.\nThis isn't quite that simple for pupils at Royal West Academy. As if classes and homework weren't already enough, students are also required to complete a range of extracurricular activities, or ECAs.\nThe range of ECAs being offered at the school is various, including everything from guitar and jewelry-making clubs, fund-raising marches, to student committees, swimming and tennis.\n\"I love ECAs. I'm so happy we have them,\" said grade 11 student Adrienne, who is a soccer player and member of the graduation committee. \"They motivate the students, and they're a great bonding experience. I think that without them, not half as many students would be joining up for the soccer team.\"\nRequiring students to complete ECAs is a sign of the times. That's because young people are preparing for the future in ways that weren't considered necessary before. This is an era when ECAs are seen as important. Whether it's for leadership experience, sports, craft skills or volunteer these things are seen as rounding out the individual and improving their future.\nECAs can also help students discover their likes and dislikes. But as the old song says, you can't always get what you want, especially when so many students are all trying to sign up for the most popular activities.\nECAs can cut into study and homework time if you're not careful.

It looked as if I had drunk too much wine, and suddenly the world began to sway and then went black. All I heard was \"Oh my god, she's falling.\" The next thing I remembered was that the EMT  was asking me my name. I was taken to the hospital by an ambulance. It turned out that I was too tired. The EMT came to check on me before I left. \n   He told me that a gentleman at the station waiting for the train saw me fall on the track when the train was coming in. He immediately got to my side and made sure that everyone kept back. He got the conductor's attention and the train stopped, and told others in the station to call 911. I was told that he stayed with me until the ambulance arrived. I asked the EMT if he had the gentleman's name or address but he said no, he said the gentleman left the hospital without a word.\n   I don't know who this gentleman is but if he reads this article and remembers a young lady fainting at the train station, I'd like him to get in touch with me and I will say \"Thank you\" to him to his face.

      "Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\""

      "The first time I heard the actual London Bridge was in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, I thought it was a joke. A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard."

In spite of this, he managed to get to the university, but it was so expensive to study there that during the holiday he found it necessary to get two jobs at the same time so as to make enough money to pay for his studies.\nOne summer he managed to get a job in a butcher's shop during the day-time, and another in a hospital at night. In the shop, he learnt to cut meat quite nicely, so the butcher often left him to do all the serving  while he went to the back room to do the accounts . In the hospital , on the other hand, he was , of course , allowed  to do the simplest jobs, like helping to lift people and to carry them from one part of the hospital to another.

The woman was already feeling frightened at the thought of the operation before he came to get her, but when she saw Tom, that finished her.\n\"No! No!\" she cried. \"Not my butcher!

      "\"Have you ever found a treasure?\" I once asked my father.He smiled a big smile and told me this story.\n\"Once when I was about ten years old,\" my father told me, \"I went treasure hunting with my older sister.She had heard some people talking about a treasure box hidden in a hillside cave.One day we went there and spent two or three hours looking for the entrance to the cave.Then, as I was trying to squeeze between two big stones, I suddenly fell into a hole.It was the mouth of a tunnel that led to the cave.My sister and I crawled through into it.It was very dark but we had brought a flashlight and we were shocked to see that there was a large wooden box ahead of us.We ran to the box and pulled it open.It was filled with silver and gold coins.I started to count them but my sister told me to stop.\"This is only money ,\"she said,\"This is not a real treasure.If you want money , all you have to do is to work for it\".\nI was going to argue with her when I suddenly noticed a big metal box on the other side of the cave.The box was filled with statues.Some statues were made of ivory or gold, with diamonds for eyes and rubies for lips.I took one of the gold statues out of the box.'Don't do that!' yelled my sister.'This is only beauty and art.It is not a real treasure.There must be something better here.'\nWe searched and searched, but there was nothing else in the cave.Then the battery in the flashlight started to die.We got scared and crawled back.I wiggled through but my sister got stuck half way between the stones.I tried to pull her out but I couldn't.I ran up and down the street knocking on doors but nobody would come.\nThe only one who would help was a girl about my age.She got a rope and a spade and a water bottle.About an hour later, we got my sister out of the stones.I became good friends with the girl who had helped us.She was very responsible, faithful, kind and loving.When we finished college I realized that she was the woman I wanted to marry.That's your mom.I thought I had found the best treasure in the world.\""

      "Four million children are caught up in the war in Syria. Thirteen-year-old Rabia is one of them. Tall and thin, she sits shaking in a yellow T-shirt at the Al Marj settlement, close to the Lebanese-Syrian border.\nHome for Rabia was once a two-story house near Damascus. Now it is a tent shared with her nine family members.\nRabia's face is covered with dirt, and she is tired and cold. She has just finished work, picking up potatoes that fell from a truck. Her typical day starts at 4 a.m., and she works a double _ that lasts about 16 hours, putting potatoes into bags. The only choice for her is that she can choose the first eight hours or the second eight hours. For this, she gets paid about $8 a day.\nWorking means Rabia misses school. Back in her village, she was the best in her class and good at everything. Her favorite subjects were Arabic literature and math. But, like many children now living in the settlements -- there are no official refugee camps in Lebanon -- that was Rabia's old life. Life before war, before her family moved five times to escape the bombs, before leaving behind her bedroom, her toys and her friends without packing a bag, before \"half the people I know\" were dead.\nThe old life was full of laughter with her sister, Wala. But Wala, 14, got married two days ago to an 18-year-old Lebanese. Rabia is happy for her sister. Life in the settlement is tough -- the children have nowhere to play, the bathing is poor and sexual abuse is out of control. You can't blame parents -- often confused, illiterate and poor -- who want to marry off their daughters. They fear for their safety.\nIncreasing numbers of Rabia's girlfriends are getting married. Once in rural Syria, a girl got married at 16. According to UNICEF, the age is now dropping to 12 or 13. It is no secret that Lebanese men want to marry Syrian refugee girls, who work hard and don't ask for anything."

      "Have you grasped the information taught by your teacher in class? Have you understood what you saw on the screen? Maybe everyone has their own learning style.\nGenerally speaking, we gather information with our minds and bodies in different ways, such as seeing, hearing and doing. Then our brains deals with that information, organizing it and connecting it to things we are already aware of. In other words, our brains will deal with the information in different ways. Sometimes we think in pictures or words. Sometimes we remember details or the big pictures.\nFor different people, their learning styles are different too. One person may find it hard to make out the information in written forms but easy to know it immediately in an oral description. However, another person might find difficulties with the picture but the written message.\nNow scientists say there exist seven basic learning styles.\n*Linguistic: These people learn through listening, reading, speaking and writing.\n*Logical: These people learn with formula   and principles  .\n*Visual: These people learn by seeing what they are studying.\n*Musical: These people learn well when information is presented through music.\n*Kinesthetic: These people learn from movement and physical activities.\n*Intrapersonal: These people learn best by linking new information directly with their own experiences.\n*Interpersonal: These people learn well by working with others.\nTherefore, if you know what learning style is your strength, you can balance your weakness, and get a more successful learning experience."

      "Food waste has been a chronic problem for restaurants and grocery stores -- with millions of tons lost along the way as crops are hauled hundreds of miles, stored for weeks in refrigerators and prepared on busy restaurant assembly lines. But the historically high price of products is making it an even bigger drag on the bottom line.\nRestaurants, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are compensating for the rising costs of waste in novel ways. Some are tracking their trash with software systems, making food in smaller packages or trying to compost (......) and cut down on trash-hauling costs.\n\"We have all come to work with this big elephant in the middle of kitchen, and the elephant is this 'It's okay to waste' belief system,\" said Andrew Shackman, president of LeanPath, a company that helps restaurants cut back food waste.\nThe interest in cutting food waste \"has just rocketed in the last six to nine months,\" he said.\nRoughly 30 percent of food in the United States goes to waste, costing some $48 billion annually, according to a Stockholm International Water Institute study. A University of Arizona study estimated that 40 to 50 percent of food in the United States is wasted. Wholesale food costs have risen more than 8 percent this year, the biggest jump in decades, according to the National Restaurant Association.\nFreshman students at Virginia Tech were surprised this year when the two of the campus' biggest dining halls to find there were no trays.\n\"You have to go back and get your dishware and your drink, but it's not that different,\" said Caitlin Mewborn, a freshman. \"It's not a big trouble. You take less food, and you don't eat more than you should.\"\nGetting rid of trays has cut food waste by 38 percent at the dining halls, said Denny Cochrane, manager of Virginia Tech's sustainability program. Before the program began, students often grabbed whatever looked good at the buffet  , only to find at the table that their eyes were bigger than their stomachs, he said."

      "TIJUANA, Mexico - A powerful earthquake swayed   buildings from Los Angeles to Tijuana, killing two people in Mexico, blacking out cities and forcing the evacuation   of hospitals and nursing homes. One California city closed off its downtown due to unstable buildings.\nThe 7.2-magnitude quake centered just south of the US border near Mexicali was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in decades.\n\"It sounds like it's felt by at least 20 million people,\" USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said. \"Most of Southern California felt this earthquake.\"\nSunday afternoon's earthquake hit hardest in Mexicali, a commerce center along Mexico's border with California, where authorities said the quake was followed by at least 20 smaller aftershocks, including ones of magnitudes 5.1, 4.5 and 4.3.\n\"It has not stopped trembling in Mexicali,\" said Baja California state Civil Protection Director Alfredo Escobedo on Monday.\nEscobedo said one man was killed when his home collapsed just outside of Mexicali and another died when he rushed into the street in panic and was struck by a car. At least 100 people were injured in the city, most of them struck by falling objects. Power was out in virtually the entire city.\nSusan Warmbier was putting away groceries in the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista when her husband asked, \"Is the house moving?\"\nElsewhere in San Diego, there were reports of shattered windows, broken pipes and water main breaks in private buildings, but no reports of injuries, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Maurice Luque said. Coronado Bridge over San Diego Bay was briefly closed as a precaution.\nAcross the border in Tijuana, Mexico, the quake caused buildings to sway and knocked out power in some areas. No tsunami warning was issued, but hundreds of people on Tijuana's crowded beach feared the worst and fled when they felt the ground shake."

      "You never played the video dance game? Now such games are used to help lose weight!\nLike many other teenage boys, Jones loves sports. But at 5 feet, 175 pounds, he found his weight in trouble. His doctor wanted him to lose 50 pounds so that he may be a good football game player by the end of the summer.\nJones chose the popular Dance Revolution video game at home to increase his activity. He had lost about 10 pounds by changing his diet. Now, after two weeks' playing the game, he has lost another 10!\nA health study is being done by an insurance company. The company hopes that the game will lead to better health and lower costs. \"Obesity claims last year cost us $ 77 million. We have to cut those costs,\" said a member of the insurance group. The company provides a game console  , a dance mat and software for the six-month, $ 60,000 study.\n _ It is widely supported by physical education and health professionals.\nIn West Virginia, 43% of the nearly 6,000 children examined for heart disease risk were considered over-weighted; more than 25% were too fat. \"We are in a crisis of childhood obesity not only in West Virginia but in America,\" said a researcher.\nResearchers are now looking at the potential for improving effects by using the game. A teacher in West Virginia has been using the video games in her classes since last fall. She reported that the game does improve heart health as well as eye-hand coordination  , and her students take the video game as a great alternative to jumping rope or ball games.\nThe US Education Department is putting the game in 20 schools to control childhood obesity. Well, are you going to try such to dance away your extra weight?"

      "Computers.Love them or hate them, it is impossible to escape from them in the modern age.They are so much a part of our everyday lives--from instant messaging to e-mails.With many people preferring to use e-mail rather than traditional regular mail, it has become very important to be aware of how we express ourselves when using e-mail.The requirement of etiquette is obviously needed.\n         Grammar and spelling\n         Firstly, if you are dealing with a formal e-mail, pay close attention to grammar and spelling.Don't forget to run your spell-check (program) at the end of the document, but don't treat it as the final word.Carefully re-read it yourself, as sometimes even spell and grammar checking programs come up with some strange explanations.Remember, your first e-mail to a potential employer or college could be your last -- you won't want to spoil your first impression by making basic errors.\n         E-mail addresses\n         Also, for official e-mails, carefully consider your existing e-mail address.A funny e-mail address (such as pinkfluffycutiepie@...com) may be fine for using with your friends, but what impression do you think this address might give to an employer or college admissions officer? Consider using one address for personal e-mails and a different one for formal use.\nUpper case \n         Take care also NOT TO TYPE UNNECESSARILY IN UPPER CASE, as this is the e-mail version of shouting.\nPersonal information\n         You should  _ too about giving away too much personal information over the Internet.It may feel much more comfortable to \"talk\" using instant messages as there are no uncomfortable silences or awkward moments, but never forget that--unless the person you are speaking to is a friend or family member--you really know nothing about them, so be careful.Further to this, NEVER agree to meet a stranger that you have spoken to online, as it can be extremely dangerous.\nMy final message though is--have fun! The Internet is exciting, useful and informative.But, as with so many things that we believe we can't live without, it is a much better servant than a master."

      "In 1789 the prefix = st1 /U.S.government passed a law which said that the land of the American Indians could never be taken from them without their agreement. One hundred years later, however, the Indians only had a very small part of the land that originally belonged to them. How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died. Between 1843 and 1854 the Indian population in one area of the country went down from 100,000 to 30,000.\nMore land was needed for the increasing number of white settlers. In Washington, the old respect for the rights of the Indians disappeared. The old promises to the Indians were broken; the government began to move groups of Indians from their original homelands to other poorer parts of the country. Some Indians reacted angrily and violently to this treatment. They began to attack white settlers, and the Indian war began. For 30 years, until the late 1880s, different groups of Indians fought against the injustices of the white man. They had a few famous successes, but the result of the struggle was never in doubt. There were too many white soldiers, and they were too powerful. Many Indians were killed; the survivors were moved from their homelands to different areas of the country. It was a terrible chapter in the history of a country that promised freedom and equality to everyone."

      "Dear Dean,\nIt is my understanding that this college has received a large donation to be used to improve the quality of life for students: expand the bookstore or add computers to the lab. I strongly argue in favor of the addition of more computers.\nWe have to think about a greater goal and a more practical way to enhance the quality of life for students. Do we want our college to be known as a place with a great bookstore where you can find CDs and gifts, or as a place where the students can research in their field using the best tools provided by technology?\nAs a learning institution, this college has the responsibility to offer its students the best technology to help them prepare for their future, since many students will be expected to be familiar with the latest software and other tools when they go on to work.\nWhile they are in college, students find they are expected to use computers. They are asked to create PowerPoint presentations and research many topics on the Internet. Being able to do projects using the computer also gives students the opportunity to find information that without a computer would be much more difficult to find. Since students are competing for good grades, those who have limited access to computers are at a great disadvantage.\nIf there are more new and faster computers accessible, students will be able to complete their work more efficiently. No more will they have to wait in line, paper and disk in hand, while scanning the room for an empty chair and computer. No longer will they have to sit and wait while an outdated computer struggles to follow their commands.\nThe more computers are used in society, the more colleges will depend on them as a tool of teaching and learning. Making computers more accessible to students _ their learning process by making it much easier and more engaging , and eventually improves their quality of life."

      "SAN ANTONIO --  For Tira Starr, an eighth grader at Anson Jones Middle School, the plastic nametag hanging around her neck that she has decorated with a smiley face and a purple bat sticker offers a way to reflect her personal interest. For administrators, it is something else entirely: a device that lets them use radio frequency technology--with scanners tucked behind walls and ceilings--to track her whereabouts. \nAnson Jones is the first school in San Antonio's Northside Independent School District to roll out the new nametags, which are part of a pilot program   intended to ensure that the district receives all of the state dollars. \nIn Texas, school finance is a numbers game: schools receive money based on the number of students counted in their homeroom classes each morning. At Anson Jones, as at other schools, many students were in school but not in homeroom, so they were not counted and the district lost money, said Pascual Gonzalez, a spokesman for the district. \n\"We were leaving money on the table,\" he said, adding that the district expects a $2 million return on an initial investment of $261,000 in the technology at two pilot schools. \nBut the radio frequency identification nametags have prompted concerns from civil liberties groups and electronic privacy watchdogs, which fear a Big Brother atmosphere in Texas public schools. \nMatthew Simpson, a policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said the technology was easy to acquire, meaning people outside a school might be able to monitor a student if they obtained the student's unique tracking number. \nMr. Simpson said the technology was originally designed for shipping goods and for cattle. \"It was never intended for people,\" he said. \nBut students and educators at Anson Jones say they are excited about the practical advantages -- getting to eat lunch faster by scanning their bar codes in the lunch line, or being able to locate a child quickly in an emergency. \nNorthside is not the first district to use the tracking devices. Two Houston-area districts began the program several years ago. The Spring district, for example, started using the technology in 2004 as a way to track elementary students getting on and off buses. It expanded the program to high school students three years ago and has so far recovered $400,000, said Karen Garrison, a spokeswoman for the district. \n\"Our system still focuses on safety but has the added benefit of recovering average daily attendance funding,\" Ms. Garrison said. \nWendy Reyes, the principal of Anson Jones, said only one parent had complained about the program at her school. On the first day of classes at Jay High School, home to the other pilot program school in Northside, several parents staged a protest across the street from the school, though most did not have students in the district. \nMany students, teachers and parents at the middle school feel the technology's benefits outweigh privacy concerns, Ms. Reyes said."

      "Many of us have heard of the saying: everything is possible if you can just believe. But few of us really know the power of faith and perseverance .  South African swimmer Natalie du Tiot embodies those virtues.\nDu Tiot, 24, became the first swimmer to compete in both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics  in Beijing. Although she finished 16thin the tough 10km marathon in the able-bodied Games, she has collected three golds in the Paralympics so far.\nOne of the most successful disabled athletes of all time, Natalie du Tiot was already a promising swimmer when she lost her leg in a motorcycle accident in 2001, at just 17.\n\"There are a lot of dark moments,\" she said, \"There are some days when I cry. But I try to remember that better days are ahead. You just go on.\"\nWithin a few months, she was back in the swimming pool.\nShe still completes and still succeeds. The only difference is she has switched to longer events--from 200m and 400m individual medley to 800m and 1,500m freestyle--to make up for her loss of speed with only one leg. But she made no adjustment to her mental look .\n\"Going out in the water, it feels as if there's nothing wrong with me. It doesn't matter if you look different. You're still the same as everybody else because you have the same dream.\"\nShe is the owner of many world records, and she also won gold when competing against able-bodied swimmers in the 1,500m freestyle at the All African Games in 2007.\nBut there is no magic recipe  for success. It all comes down to hard work and determination. \"She is stubborn, which is good and bad,\" said her coach Karoly Von Toros. \"Good for the swimming, but bad for the coach.\"\nThere is a poem that hangs on her wall that reads:\nThe tragedy  of life does not lie in not reaching your goals;\nThe tragedy of life lies in not having goals to reach for."

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.\nIt's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.\nMany people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.\nThe following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.\nThe nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"\nThe angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.\nSo, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on."

      "The Worst Part\nMom is usually home on Sunday but this week she was going to a big golf game and I was all alone in the house. I was mad at Mom for divorcing Dad.\nI kept looking at the telephone until I couldn't stand it any longer. I picked up the receiver and dialed Dad's number over in Bakersfield. I even remembered to dial 1 first because it was long distance. \"You promised to phone me this week but you didn't,\" I said, feeling I had to talk to him.\n\"Take it easy, kid,\" he said. \"I just didn't get around to it. I was going to call this evening. The week isn't over yet.\"\nI thought about that.www.ks5u.com\n\"Something on your mind?\" he asked.\n\"I hoped you would call, so I waited and waited.\" Then I was sorry I said it.\n\"There was heavy snow in the morning,\" he said, \"I had to chain up on highway 80 and lost time.\"\nI know putting chains on eight big wheels in the snow is no fun.I felt a little better, as long as we were talking. \"How is Bandit?\" I asked.\nThere was a funny silence. For a minute I thought the line was dead. Then I knew something must have happened to my dog.\n\"Well, kid--\", he began. \"My name is Leigh!\" I almost yelled. \"I'm not just some kid you met on the street!\"\n\"Keep your shirt on, Leigh,\" he said. \"When I had to stop along with some other truckers to put on chains, I left Bandit out of the cab, I thought he would get back ... I have sent out a call to CB radio, but I didn't get an answer yet.\" I was about to say I understood when there came the bad part, the really bad part.

      "Language changes all the time. The words used by young people in the UK can be very different to those used by adults. These extremely informal words and expressions are known as \"slang\". Here are a few examples:\n*Instead of using different tag question like isn't it? Can't you or don't they? People use \"innit\".e.g. It's hot here, isn't it?=\"It's\" hot here, innit!\n*Instead of saying very, really or completely, they use \"well\". e.g. I'm well tired.\n* \"Whatever\" means \"I don't care\". e.g. A: But the teacher says we can't leave until we've finished. B:Whatever. I'm going.\nNobody uses slang and not everybody likes it. A school in Sheffield, in the north of England, recently instructed its pupils to stop using slang words. The head teacher says that if young people learn to speak 'correctly' this will help them get a good job.\nWhen British people use slang, it's no surprise that some students say they can't understand native speakers. But perhaps learners don't need to worry about communicating with native speakers so much. Research shows that most of the English spoken in the world today is spoken between non-native speakers of the language. In fact, when we think about \"International English\", there is no such thing as a native or non-native speaker.\nHow important is it to understand these slang words and expressions? If you watch films or TV, chat online in English, then understanding slang can be very useful. But you probably won't see much slang in your English exam though. With over seven billion people living on our planet today, it's easy to think one person's actions won't make a difference, however, from personal experience, I can say: each of us is capable of making a difference, however small, to someone's life."

      "LONDON: What could possibly be wrong with planting trees? The advantages are obvious; they  firm the soil, soak up   extra water and take carbon dioxide   out of the atmosphere.\nHowever, it now turns out that planting trees could add to global warming.\nTree roots do a great job of keeping soil firmly on the ground and out of the wind's power. The problem is that some of those dust clouds play an important part in soaking up carbon dioxide.\nHuge dust storms blow out over the oceans from dry parts of North Africa and central Asia. Tons of dust are lifted and left as a thin film over the ocean surface. The dust fuels oceanic life.\nDust from China is carried east and left in the Pacific Ocean. If a tree-planting programme there is successful and the dust supply reduced, the net result may be that less carbon dioxide gets locked away in the ocean.\nAndy Ridgwell, an environmental scientist from the University of East Anglia, has spent the past few years studying dust and says his work \"shows clearly the complexity of the system and the importance of not tinkering  with it without understanding the results. For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface.\"\nAn American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. \"We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, \" says Jackson.\nIn wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground. Countries that plan to _ global warming by planting trees may have to think again. Solutions  to environmental problems are often more complex than they first appear, and understanding the Earth's climate is a very great challenge."

      "1. Penguins Mate for Life\nDuring the mid-2000s, films like \"Happy Feet\" made penguins all the rage, and young lovers went around spreading the facts like \"penguins mate for life.\" While the idea is sweet, it's not exactly true.\nPenguins usually stick with their partners through the mating season, but when it's time to mate again, they choose whomever is convenient, not necessarily their old flame.\n2. Vincent Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear\nThis is not entirely true. It was not his entire ear - just the tip of the lobe  - and some say he didn't even do it. Van Gogh lived with artist Paul Gauguin, who had quite a violent temper, and many believe Gauguin actually did the cutting.\nEither way, Van Gogh did reportedly send the tip to a prostitute.\n3. Napoleon Bonaparte was Short\nEveryone knows Napoleon Bonaparte was a tiny man - after all, his nickname was \"le Petit Corporal.\" His reputation for being short even inspired the phenomenon known as the \"Napoleon complex.\"\nIn reality, Napoleon stood around 5 feet and 7 inches tall, which was very average back in the day. Many believe his nickname was meant as a term of endearment, not a reference to his height.\n4. Ben Franklin Preferred a Turkey to a Bald Eagle\nThe bald eagle is certainly a well-known representation of America, but legend has it that if Ben Franklin had his way, a turkey would have been much better. In reality, Franklin wrote a letter to his daughter mocking the eagle symbol used in a seal  by the Society of the Cincinnati, a private military group.\nHe said it looked like a turkey and may as well be one.\n5. You Have Five Senses\nIf you remember learning about the senses in elementary school, you know humans possess five: sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. Most scientists agree, however, that you have more like 10-20 senses, including pain, hunger, thirst, temperature, and more.\n6. George Washington had Wooden Teeth\nGeorge Washington is known for three things: being the first president, chopping down a cherry tree, and having wooden teeth. At least one of these is certainly not true. While Washington did have bad teeth, his dentures  were not wooden.\n7. Einstein was a Bad Student\nIf you ever made bad grades and pulled the old \"Albert Einstein used to make bad grades\" card with your parents or teachers, you are lucky you got away with it. In reality, Einstein was at the top of his class and mastered calculus when he was barely a teenager.\nThe reputation he developed for being a bad student had more to do with his behavior. He liked to talk back to his teachers."

      "For my brother and I, mowing  yards during the summer is a good way to earn pocket change. Dad was our salesman. He traded our service to neighbors at a low price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $10 per yard. However, I later found out our competitors were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work.\nOne afternoon we were cutting our neighbor's yard. When I was finishing up, I was tired and sweaty. I pictured the tall glass of icy drink I would have to cool down soon. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece. I thought about the poor change I was getting paid for cutting grass so high that it almost broke the mower. I ignored him and kept walking. Dad called me out, \"You missed a piece.\"\nI frowned  , hoping he would let me slide and go home. He kept pointing. So angry, I went back to cut that piece of grass. I said to myself, \"That one piece isn't hurting anyone. Why won't he just let it go?\"\nBut when I became an adult, I understood his message: When you are running a business, the work you do says a great deal about you. If you want to be seen as a businessman with honesty, you must deliver a quality product. That single piece of grass meant the job was not done.\nOther neighbors took notice of the good work we did and we soon got more business. We started out with one client , but by the end of the summer we had five.\nThe lesson my dad taught me stayed with me: If you say you are going to perform a job at a certain time, keep your word. Give your customers the kind of service you would like to receive. It shows how sincere you are and how much pride you take in your work."

      "Full-time university students spend all their time studying. They don't do other work. Their course usually lasts for three or four years. Medical students have to follow a course lasting for six or seven years. Then they graduate as doctor. In prefix = st1 /Britain, full-time university students have three terms of about ten weeks in each year. During these terms they go to lectures or they study by themselves. Their vacations are long, but of course they can use them to study at home.\n  Some universities, like Oxford and Cambridge in England, are residential. This means that during the university terms the students live in universities.\n  Other universities are non-residential. Some of the students at these universities can live in a university hotel, but many live at home or in lodgings and have to travel daily to their lectures. Large cities often have universities of this kind, sometimes the students have to spend a lot of time on their journeys.\n  Full-time students are also called internal students, because they spend all their times at universities. There are also external students who cannot attend the university full-time but who are studying for its examinations. They are part-time students. They have to do other work during the day, usually to earn their living, and they study in the evening.\n  External students are often older than full-time internal students. Sometimes they can attend lectures in the evening, but many of them have to study by correspondence .they write at home the work that is set by their tutors .Then have to pass their work to their tutors post corrections and advice back to them.\n  In some countries,\" Universities of the Air\" can now help students to receive degrees. After special lectures on radio or television, these students have to send set work for correction by correspondence .However, for a few weeks each year they can attend special vacation course at universities."

Others have trouble getting on well with people like their parents and classmates.\nLi Wen, a student from No.2 High School, could not follow his teachers in class and, therefore, was doing badly in his lessons. He was in such low spirits for a long time that he started to cut his finger with a knife.\nAnother student, 16-year-old Yang Fang from No.1 High School, was afraid of exams.

      "Early this morning, I got up to make cookies for my neighbor. But actually she hardly greeted me when we saw each other.\nLast Monday, she called the firefighters when my house began to fog up while I was out. Luckily, nothing serious had happened. When I thanked her and apologized for causing the trouble, she just asked if my cats were all right and stepped into her house. I felt strangely safe, knowing that even though we don't get along, she'd done the right thing. So, the yummy cookies.\nLast winter, my neighbor carelessly let it out that she was holding a _ towards me because of an incident we'd had four years ago. I had particularly apologized and asked if there was anything I could do to improve our relationship. She would not accept my apology.\nIt had taken me a lot of courage to apologize and ask that question. Her refusal to make amends   really saddened me. After that, I decided I'd just leave her be. So I was really scared she was going to refuse my offer again. I know some people have a hard time understanding how the possibility of rejection can make an adult so afraid, but that's just the way I felt.\nThen, I reminded myself of how good I had felt yesterday when I'd done some acts of kindness after telling myself: Feel the fear, and do it anyway! So I put the cookies on a beautiful plate, opened my apartment door--and there she was, standing in the hallway. But when she saw me, she went back inside. I went after her and quickly said, \"I'm sorry, I've got something for you! I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you were paying attention on Monday.\" When she heard me speaking, she turned around. As I held the plate towards her, her eyebrows winged up and she took the plate. I was so happy and excited.\nBack in my place, I did a \"happy dance\", because I had dared to be kind even though I hadn't been sure my kindness would be welcome. I do hope that our relationship will slowly get better. I know I was and still am biased   towards her at times, but even if we don't make amends, I want to be able to be kind without depending on other people's behaviors and reactions."

      "One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons \"capitals of industry\" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel \"robber barons\", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth.\nThe early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.\nAs the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business.\nThere were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines.\nOver the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations."

      "The pupils of the remote Beau-Roc primary school in Haiti are chanting (singing the same words again and again).One of them plays a guitar made from an empty oil tin.Their headmistress, Emile Jean-Noel, is one of the few women school headteachers in the country.\nToday, over 70% of Haitian population live without proper food, water, schools, or housing. To reduce the hunger that prevents learning and to encourage parents to send their children to school, meals are provided by the World Food Programme.\n\"We are so cut off that we have many difficulties,\" comments Emile, adding that finding chalk, school books and other materials is practically impossible.Emile tries to encourage people around her to make use of available resources.Her efforts are bearing fruit.One of her successes was convincing local women to contribute to their children' s schooling and increase their income by selling embroidery  and other handicrafts.\nRecent political instability has meant that the country has not invested   in education for ten years.Only 44% of children go to school and less than half of them finish primary school. Less than a third of these children go on to secondary school.In rural areas it is not rare to find 17 and 18 year olds in primary school- Beau-Roc has only 4 teachers for 260 pupils.Emile works constantly to improve her pupils' environment.Under her direction, a local worker is now constructing a store house for the food delivered regularly by the WFP.\nNot only is Emile' s salary small, but she receives it irregularly.For her, transport is a real headache.She lives five kilometers away and has to take the tap tap, a privately-owned bus, costing more than she can afford.\n\"The decision to be a rural teacher in Haiti should not be taken lightly\" , Emile comments. \"With all the sacrifices and risks it requires, only _ should do it.\" However, Emile loves her job.\"I always feel at home with the children and, because the parents understand what I'm doing, I try to give my best.\""

      "\"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\"\n--Albert Einstein\nIf you have a kid with special needs in the school system, chances are you have come across that saying hanging on a classroom wall. My five-year-old daughter Syona has cerebral palsy (a medical condition affecting someone's control over their movement ) and it means, combined with her communication challenges and sight problems, that standard assessments (and by \"standard\", I mean the ones used to assess kids with special needs ) aren't always an accurate measure of her abilities.\nBy now you have probably heard about Chris Ulmer, the 26-year-old teacher in Jacksonville, Florida, who starts his special education class by calling up each student individually to give them much admiration and a high-five (a gesture of greeting or congratulation). I couldn't help but be reminded of Syona's teacher and how she supports each kid in a very similar way. Ulmer recently shared a video of his teaching experience. \"I have seen their confidence and self-worth increase rapidly, \" he said. All I could think was: How lucky these students are to have such inspirational teachers.\nSyona's teacher has an attitude that can best be summarized in one word: awesome. Her teacher doesn't focus on what can't be done--she focuses on what can be done. Over the past several months, my husband Dilip and I have seen Syona's confidence increase tenfold. She uses words she wouldn't have thought of using before. She recently told me about her classmate's trip to Ecuador and was very proud when I understood her on the first try.\nI actually wonder what the influence would be if we did something similar to what Ulmer does with his students in our home. We've recently started our day by reminding each other of the good qualities we all possess. If we are reminded of our strengths on a regular basis, we will become increasingly confident about progress and success.\nUlmer's reach as a teacher goes far beyond the walls of his classroom. In fact, he teaches all of us to take a moment and truly appreciate the strengths of an important person in our lives."

      "Office workers should know that long periods of sitting at your desk may be a killer. Scientists have shown a new threat from this lifestyle that they call  \"muscular inactivity  \".\nSitting still for long periods of time leads to the buildup of substances   in the blood that are harmful to health. And exercise alone won't drive them away.\nMillions of people spend their days between car,office desk and the sofa in front of the TV. While the bad influences are well rocognized,it has been thought that they can be changed by regular trips to the gym or swimming pool.\nNow researchers say that is not enough. In addition to regular exercise,office workers need to keep moving while they work,by making regular trips to the printer,coffee machine or to chat with workmates.\nElin EkblomBak,an expert on health,says research shows long periods of sitting and lack    of \"whole body muscular movement\"  are strongly linked to obesity,heart disease and cancer,and a higher risk of death,regardless of   whether they take enough exercise.\n\"Everyone knows about the health benefits of regular exercise. But what we haven't realized before is that longperiod sitting down carries an extra risk that cannot be dealt with by taking exercise,\" Dr EkblomBak said,adding that sitting still should be recognized as a risk to health.\n\"It is important to have a fiveminute break from desk work every 45 minutes. Don't email workmates--walk across the office to give them the message. Take a coffee break or put the printer in the next room. I am a desk worker and I try to do it. It is not difficult but sometimes you get lost in your work and you forget about it.\"\nHowever,more studies are needed to confirm the ill effects of sitting for too long and ways of fighting them. But at present they conclude that  \"keep moving\"  should be added to the advice to \"keep exercising.\""

      "Robots that can chat,find misplaced glasses,draw aeroplanes and play with your children are drawing thousands of visitors' attention during an expo in Tokyo as Japan adapts to changes in society.\nRobots,such as the soundsensitive Chapit,answer simple questions and even joke with people to help the lonely fight loneliness and stay active in old age.\n\"Many older people in Japan live alone and have no one to talk to,\" said Kazuya Kitamura,a representative of the expo organizer.\"Communication robots accompany people and don't mind listening to the same stories over and over again.\"\nWhile Chapit,a relatively simple robot,managed to _ a corporate partner,many researchers,such as Kiyoshi Matsumoto,a professor at the University of Tokyo,struggle to interest sponsors for more expensive projects.\nMatsumoto's \"Personal Mobility Robot\",equipped with four cameras and a sensor to recognize the user's centre of gravity,is designed to help the elderly move around without pressing buttons,using joysticks  or rotating  wheels as in traditional wheelchairs.\nThe robot can also help find misplaced glasses by identifying them with a sensor.\n\"We have developed a robot that can assist many people,but because of the high cost,we still haven't found a sponsor,\"said Matsumoto,who added that the cost of the machine,if massproduced,would be comparable to that of a car.\n\"In the current economic environment there are few companies willing to invest in such a costly project,\" he said.\nOther robots,such as the awardwinning \"DiGRO\" can support busy parents who have little time to play with their children.\nThe robot can use the Internet to find a simple image and then draw pictures,keeping children company while their parents work.\nJapan has one of the world's fastestageing societies and the government predicts that by 2050 the proportion of people over 65 will reach 40 percent."

      "Those who have suffered from _ know the sinking feeling of watching the clock tick.Now a new study in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggests that lying in bed awake may actually contribute to the problem of sleeplessness.\nThe study of 79 adults(average age 72)with insomnia aimed to determine whether brief behavioral interventions for insomnia would help.Traditional behavioral therapy requires at least half a dozen hour-long sessions with a therapist -- a costly commitment many patients either can't make or don't have access to.Other options include sleep-aiding medications or supplements.In the current study,the 39 participants in the behavioral therapy group received a 45- to 60-minute instructing session,plus a 30-minute follow-up session and two 20-minute phone calls.\nDoctors offered the following behavioral interventions for improving sleep: reduce time in bed; get up at the same time every day,regardless of sleep duration; don't go to bed unless sleepy; and don't stay in bed unless asleep.\nThe other 40 participants in the study were given printed educational materials about insomnia,which included the same instructions given to the intervention group,but without the individualized sessions with a therapist.Two weeks later,the latter group also got a 10-minute follow-up phone call.\nAt the end of four weeks,the behavioral treatment group was significantly more likely to show improvements in sleep than the printed-materials group.By that time,55% of those who received behavioral treatment no longer met the criteria for insomnia,compared with 13% of the group that got educational brochures.\nThe good news comes at the same time as a report on the health effects of insomnia from the U.K.'s Mental Health Foundation.The report,Sleep Matters,suggests a link between insomnia and poor relationships,low energy levels and an inability to concentrate.Poor sleep has already been linked to depression,immune deficiency and heart disease."

      "It's official, not making your bed keeps you healthy. Dust mites   present in everyone's home can cause asthma, but they can not live in the dry conditions of an unmade bed.\nThe average bed is home to one and a half million mites, and they cause a number of common allergies  , as they chomp away on human skin in the night; and then produce the allergens which we inhale  .\nDust mites grow in the warm humid conditions prevalent in the occupied bed, but they cannot multiply without moisture. So leaving the bed unmade during the day means that the water is not retained by the sheets, which means that the mites dehydrate   and die.\nResearcher Dr. Stephen Pretlove who has developed a computer model to track how changes in the home can reduce a numbers of dust mites said, \"We know that mites can only survive by taking in water from the atmosphere using small glands on the outside of their body.\"\nIn the next stage of their research, the scientists are putting mite pockets into beds in 36 houses around the United Kingdom. This will test the _ of the computer model and will investigate how people's daily routines affect mite populations.\nBuilding features such as heating ventilation   and insulation   will also be adjustable to monitor how the mites cope and react to different atmospheres.\nDr. Pretlove said the research had potential to reduce the PS700 million spent treating mite-induced illnesses each year in the UK.\n\"Our findings could help building designers create healthy homes and health care workers point out environments most at risk from mites.\"\nDr. Matt Hallsworth, of the charity Asthma UK, said, \"House-dust mite allergen can be an important trigger for many people with asthma, but at present many people find they are inevitable.\""

      "My grandfather came from Hungary and was the only one in his family who settled down in the United States. The rest of his family remained in Europe. When World War I broke out, he seemed to have become another man, downhearted. Such obvious change was not born out of concern for his welfare, but out of fear: if his only son, my uncle, had to go to war, it would be cousin fighting against cousin.\nOne day in 1918, my Uncle Milton received his draft notice. My grandparents were very upset. But my mother, at the age of 10, felt on top of the world about her soldier brother going off to war. Realizing how he was regarded by his little sister and all of her friends, my uncle bought them all service pins, which meant that they had a loved one in the service. All the little girls were delighted.\nThe moment came when my uncle and the other soldiers, without any training but all in uniforms, boarded the train. The band played and the crowd cheered. Although no one noticed. I'm sure my grandmother had a tear in her eye for the only son. The train slowly pulled out, but not about a thousand yards when it suddenly paused. Everyone stared in wonder as the train slowly returned to the station. There was a dead silence before the doors opened and the men started to step out. Someone shouted, \"The war is over!\" For a moment, nobody moved, but then the people heard someone bark orders at the soldiers. The men lined up in two lines, walked down the steps, and with the band playing, marched down the street, as returning heroes, to be welcomed home. My mother said it was a great day, but she was just a little disappointed that it didn't last a tiny bit longer."

      "Why do people travel? Well, many people travel because they want to see other countries and visit places that are famous, interesting or beautiful. People also travel to meet new friends, to try new kind of food, to experience life in other parts of the world or simply to get away from cold weather. Yet there are other reasons why people travel. Many of today's travelers are looking for an unusual experience and adventure travel is becoming more and more popular. Here is a quick look at two popular activities: hiking and rafting.\nHIKING\nHiking is a great way to travel. You will get close to nature and take exercise at the same time. Hiking is easy to do and doesn't have to be very expensive. You can hike close to home or travel to other places. The basic equipment you need for hiking is simple: good shoes, clothes and a backpack. You can hike in the mountains, in a forest or along a river. You can also go for a hike in the city.\nHiking is fun and exciting, but you shouldn't forget safety. Here are some basic tips for successful hiking: 1. Don't hike alone. 2. Tell someone where you are going; 3. Bring water and a good map; 4. Watch out for dangers, such as spiders, snakes, or poisonous plants; 5. Wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun; 6.Bring a mobile phone if you have one.\nRAFTING\nAnother exciting adventure is rafting. A raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams. Rafting is a good way to experience nature. If you want a normal rafting trip, choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers. The name \"whitewater\" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly.\nAs with hiking, you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes. You also need to learn the basic skills of rafting, such as how to handle the raft, how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft. You should not go rafting unless you know how to swim, and you should always wear a life jacket."

      "(China Daily,,)\nA winner of the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards, Professor Vivian Wing-wah Yam says she could not have done it without the backing of her family. \nThe road to scientific discovery is tougher for women than for men and Professor Vivian Wing-wah Yam says she couldn't have succeeded without such a supportive family. The 47-year-old from Hong Kong University was one of five women scientists, from each continent, to receive the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards at a ceremony on March 3, at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. It is the 13th edition of the award since 1998.\nYam's long and fruitful research on solving the energy problem won her the prize for Asia and the Pacific. There are several renewable and sustainable  energy solutions, like solar power, which could provide an unlimited source of energy. Some problems must be resolved, however, such as the low efficiency of solar cells and their high supply costs. Yam and her colleagues hope to overcome these problems by developing and testing new photoactive  materials.\nShe became the third Chinese women scientist honored with the so-called \"woman's Nobel Prize\" award, after Professor Li Fanghua from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Professor Ye Ruyu from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2004.\n\"People think chemists are bad guys, but we are the good guys,\" Yam said in a humorous aside before explaining her research project on photoactive materials in an earlier speech at L'Institut de France. For Yam, chemistry is science, but also an art. Amazed by the universe, nature and color1 in her childhood, Yam decided on a career in chemistry. \"One of the beauties of chemistry is the ability to create new molecules and chemical species. I have always associated chemists with artists, creating new things with innovative  ideas,\" Yam said.\nAs a mother of two daughters, 12 and 14, Yam said she is lucky to have been supported by her family. She was inspired as a child by her father, a professor in the Civil Engineering Faculty at Hong Kong University. Yam added her husband, Mak Shingtat, a PhD in chemistry, who accompanied Yam to the awards ceremony, was also fully supportive of her work. \"I can't imagine how my career could move on without his understanding and support,\" she said. \"I often stay late at night in the laboratory. He always waits for me outside.\"\nYam received her bachelor and PhD degrees from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). She taught at City Polytechnic of Hong Kong before joining HKU as a faculty member, and headed the chemistry department for two terms from 2000 to 2005. At 38, she was the youngest member elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She is also a Fellow of TWAS, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, and was awarded the State Natural Science Award and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Centenary Medal. 2011 is the 100th anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize, coinciding  with the International Year of Chemistry. Today, Curie is still a role model for women in science.\nAlthough the participation of women in science, is promoted by UNESCO, notably through L'Oreal-UNESCO, there are still too few women doing high-level science, says UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova. The latest UNESCO report shows less than 40 percent of countries provide girls and boys equal access to education.\nEach year, the L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award _ 15 young women from all over the world, especially developing countries, to encourage and finance their studies. More than 200 young women scientists are currently supported. \"I do not think there is a difference between men and women in terms of their intellectual abilities and research capabilities ,\" Yam said. \"As long as one has the passion, dedication and determination to pursue research wholeheartedly, one can excel regardless of one's gender or background.\"\nYam said some young women, who require stability and security, often have to give up their research because of family pressures. \"The only way for women to succeed in science is to get the mental and material support from family and society. There is a day-care center at my university, and my husband and mother-in-law help a lot with the housework, so I am able to spend my time on research,\" she said. \"I have two young daughters, and it is too early to tell whether or not they want to pursue careers in science. But, I will encourage them to always defend their ideas. To remain determined, and to never be afraid of failure - this is the advice that they will need to succeed in realizing their dreams.\" \nYam also acknowledged her colleague's support, at the awards ceremony. \"This (award) not only recognizes me, but my colleagues and students and my country, China.\""

      "Fluency  in another language is one of the most important aims of a newcomer to another country. In addition, understanding the culture and learning to communicate comfortably with people of that culture are as important as learning the rules of the language. Language learning and culture learning go together and may take a long time.\nSometimes people feel that they understand a culture after a few weeks or months. People do learn a lot when they first begin living in another culture, but this is only the first stage of learning. It usually involves  things like learning everyday activities and some basic customs.\nTo really understand another culture, people have to go beyond the first stage, This is challenge because it is often difficult to know what to learn. Much of what we call \"culture\" is hard to see.\nCulture is like an iceberg. Picture in your mind a huge iceberg in the ocean. The only part of the iceberg that you see is the tip. You don't see the rest of the iceberg because it is hidden from sight in the water. It is easy to forget that it is there. Most of the iceberg is deep within the ocean, just as much of a culture is deep within its people.\nWhen you meet someone from another culture, certain culture differences are obvious: You hear another language or you hear your own language spoken with an accent. You see different foods, clothes and sometimes physical characteristics of people. You observe new customs or habits, such as the use of chopsticks, and, bowing or kissing on both cheeks as a greeting. These differences are interesting and important, but they are usually not too difficult to understand. They are visible so they are seen easily and quickly.\nThe part of culture that is like the underwater part of the iceberg _ assumptions , communication styles, values, and beliefs about what is right and wrong. The hidden part of culture affects much of a person's way of thinking and communicating. It is the meaning behind his or her verbal   and nonverbal language. Learning to communicate well with people from another culture involves becoming aware of the hidden part of culture."

      "In the United States, 30 percent of the people have a \"weight problem\". To many people the cause is obvious  : they eat too much. But scientific evidence   does little to support this idea. Going back to America of 1910, we find that people were thinner than today, yet they at e more food. In those days people worked harder physically, walked more, used machines much less, and didn't watch television.\nSeveral modern studies, moreover, have shown that fatter people don't eat more on average than thinner people. A 1979 study of 3,545 London office workers showed that fat people eat less than slim   people.\nStudies also show that slim people are more active than fat people. A study by a research group at Stanford University found the following interesting facts:\nThe more the man ran, the greater loss of the body fat.\nThe more they ran, the greater increase in food intake.\nThus, those who ran the most ate the most, yet lost the greatest amount of body fat."

      "Methods of training animals have changed greatly in recent years. Zoo keepers have always had problems getting the animals to leave their cages in order for the cages to be cleaned, and also training them to move indoors when appropriate. Another problem was that many of the large animals became _ and bored. In the last twenty years, scientists have done research on dolphins and whales, training them to obey commands. The scientists found they could get animals to obey by rewarding them with food and affection when they responded correctly.\nProper training allows the animals to receive the care they need. It was very difficult to get untrained animals, especially the larger ones, to stay still when they needed medical attention. Now they can be trained, on command, to remain still and even to allow blood samples to be taken and shots administered. All this is accomplished through positive reinforcement, without the use of any force. Affection training, as this process is called, has been used with great success on a wide variety of zoo animals. Animal behavior experts have taught zoo keepers to train bears, tigers, monkeys, and many other species to behave in a way that provides for better animal-keeper interaction. This training also keeps the animals from becoming bored and inactive.\nAlthough some people proclaim  that this training is inhumance and cruel to animals, results have shown that captive animals who previously were not doing well flourish under the new training procedures."

Schwartz could keep her pet with the help of a veterinarian and conservation officers.\n\"It makes me feel good,\"said Schwartz of the announcement.\"She is my life.and I've had her since the day she's been born.\"\nThe relationship began when a friend found the orphaned fawn   along a nearby logging road,more than a kilometer away from her current home,said Schwartz. The friend brought the fawn over because she knew Schwartz had raised a deer before.\nSchwartz named the fawn Bimbo,based on a Gene Autry song that was playing inside her home at the time,and began feeding the animal goat's milk.\nDays turned into months and years, and now Bimbo's a part of the family."

      "Selfies   have become an increasingly common way to capture memorable moments. When it comes to taking selfies , knowing the following tips can directly affect the quality of your final product. .\nThe use of light is vital to improving image quality. Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast. Some apps offer useful filters, which can change your skin tone and eliminate pimples   on your face."

      "Scientists in Mexico have just begun a new study of one of the world's biggest pyramids: the Pyramid of the Sun, north of Mexico City. They're putting lots of small, high-tech machines under the pyramid to try to unlock some of its secrets. For thousands of years, people have tried to uncover the secrets of the pyramids.\nThe people who built the pyramids made lots of secret doors and rooms to stop robbers from finding the treasures inside. However, there always have been some smart thieves in history. Now, almost all of Egypt's pyramids have been robbed, including the Great Pyramid of Khufu, which is the largest pyramid in the world. It is the only one of the ancient wonders of the world that is still standing.\nIn AD 820, an Arab king named Abdullah AL Manum got a group of workers to dig their way into the Great Pyramid and have a look. Inside the pyramid, they found three rooms --- the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber. But to their surprise, the men didn't find the treasures they wanted. The Queen's and King's Chambers were both empty! Where were the King's mummy and his treasures? Had someone already taken them away? The huge stone doors at the pyramid's entrance were still closed when AL Manum's men went inside. How had the thieves got in and out?\nSince then, many people have gone inside the Great Pyramid to have a look or to try to take things. But still, no other chambers or walkways have been found.\nIn 2002, an American team made the most recent visit to the Great Pyramid. Scientists sent a robot into the pyramid, but they only found a mysterious locked stone door."

      "The chimp didn't feel well. She fell over, ignoring the other wild chimps. Finally, the sick chimp crawled over to a bush, picked some leaves and swallowed them. By the next afternoon, the chimp was as good as new!\nBiologists watching the chimp were surprised. Somehow, the plant had cured the chimp! Did the chimp know the plant would make her feel better? Or was it just a lucky accident?\nMany scientists don't think it has anything to do with luck. They're discovering that some animals seem to use plants to cure themselves. And these animals are leading scientists to new plants that could cure humans!\nDr. Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard University, agrees that animals may know something we don't know about forest plants.\nWrangham got to know chimps and their diets while studying them for three years in Tanzania. \"You must know a lot about an animal's feeding habits to know what it doesn't consider food,\" Wrangham explains. Every morning, he saw that most chimps ate fruit near their nests. Later on, they ate on leaves.\nWhen he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, Wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. Another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves.\n\"They swallowed the leaves whole,\" explains Wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. \"They seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths. They closed their eyes, wrinkled their noses and swallowed slowly. \"\nWrangham wondered what could be so good about something tasting so bad. He had a chemist analyze the leaves. He discovered that the leaves contain a red oil that kills different viruses . Later tests showed that the oil might even fight cancer and the AIDS virus!\nWhy don't the chimps chew the leaves? \"Rubbing the leaves between the tongue and the inside of the mouth might allow the chemicals to enter the bloodstream directly,\" he suggests, \"instead of going to the stomach, where they might get destroyed by acids. The chimps seem to know what they're doing.\""

      "The vast, rural stretches of the United States have, in many ways, defined the American spirit. Up until the 20th century, the majority of Americans lived in the countryside, in what's called --Middle America or the Heartland.\nBut research has shown that growing up in America's Heartland can put students at a disadvantage when it comes to their college education. This, in turn, can hinder (to make it difficult for something to develop or succeed) their social mobility.\nA 2015 study released by the US Department of Education investigated the gap between urban and rural college students, by concentrating on a group of high school graduates from Indiana.\nUS' national statistics had previously shown that only 27 percent of rural students enroll in college, compared to 37 percent of city kids.\nWhat the study found was that urban and rural students left high school with similar academic backgrounds. Yet, the rural students were more inclined to settle for two-year colleges or less selective universities, even though they had the potential to attend to better schools.\nThe researchers say distance heavily influenced the students' decisions. The farther rural graduates high schools were from colleges, the more likely rural graduates were to enroll in a two-year college or to undermatch with a college, the report read. Many of the rural students indicated that living close to family was a priority.\nBut the researchers also noted that resources were scarcer for the rural students. Selective universities tended to concentrate their recruitment efforts on dense, urban centers, where there were more students to meet.\nA rural teen's educational opportunities may also depend on gender. Casey Quinlan, writing for The Atlantic, notes that rural women are more likely to marry sooner. Early marriage occurs most frequently among young adults with low educational background, Quinlan said, citing a 2010 study.\nBut the problem of social mobility isn't limited to the rural population. The United States has one of the highest rates of income inequality among developed nations. And by some measures, rural residents might have an advantage.\nStanford University's 2015 Poverty and Inequality Report found that poverty was hardest to escape in the American South, and in places with high racial segregation. It concluded that urban areas actually--tend to have lower rates of social mobility than rural areas.\nThe successful children growing up in rural areas do not just ' _ ' but also generally move out. That is, they typically move to large metropolitan areas, often out of their state of birth, the report explained.\nRural areas are also hoping to give their residents a boost up the social ladder. In Kansas, graduates can get $15,000 (95,297 yuan) to pay off their student debt if they move to a rural county. They keep more money in their pockets and get to enjoy more economic freedom as a result."

Fifty-two percent of parents have not chosen not to tell their children just how wealthy they are,and 15 percent have given away nothing about the family wealth. One in three parents said they had never thought to do it.\nThey are worried that their children would become lazy, spend money freely,make bad decisions and even become a target for attractive women who use their looks to get money from rich men.\nOnly 34 percent strongly agreed that their children would be able to handle any inheritance they plan to leave them.\n\"There is an expectation about the wealthy parents that _ have a responsibility to pass down their fortune to the next generation,\" said Sallie Krawcheck,president of the Global Wealth and Investment Management of the Bank of America. \"Our research, however, uncovered changing views of what one generation owes the next.\"\nThe trend is led by the world's richest man Bill Gates, who promised in 2008 that he would leave his $58 billion fortune to the charity started by him and his wife, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ,and not to his children.\n\" We want to give it back to society in the way that it will have the most positive effect,\" he said.\nOf his plans for his children , Gates said: \"I will give the kids some money but not a meaningful percentage... they will need to work but they will feel reasonably taken care of.\""

      "prefix = st1 /Wuthering Heights has a difficult narrative structure. The story begins in 1801. It is first narrated by Lockwood, a visitor staying in Thrushcross Grange, one of the two houses, where we can meet different characters in the novel. Lockwood is a narrow, dull man who is basically afraid of feeling; as a result, he is a bad man who lives emotionally through a dirty interest in the lives of others. It is this side of his character that leads into the main narrative stream of the novel. His interest in what he sees and experiences on his visits to Wuthering Heights leads him to encourage  Nelly Dean, the house-keeper at the Grange, to provide him with the information concerning the people that he has met: Heathcliff, Cathy, Hareton, Joseph and, of course, the ghost of Catherine.\nNelly Dean's story forms the major part of the narrative. While Nelly is meant to be an objective narrator, she has a lot to do with what has happened over the past twenty-five years that have led to the present state of affairs. Therefore, as readers, we need to realize how Nelly presents events and characters and her own role in determining the course of events.\nThe final part of the novel concerns the immediate future and provides us with the results of Lockwood's visit to the Heights and the appearance of Catherine's ghost. It is narrated by both Lockwood and Nelly.\nFinally, Isabella, the one time wife of Heathcliff, through a letter, narrates one middle part of the novel.\nAlthough this narrative structure may, at first, be very difficult, it is necessary because in the world of the novel, time order of the years is not so important; the events of twenty-five years ago are as much a part of the present as those in which Lockwood finds himself in 1801."

      "The engineer Camilla Olivetti was 40 years old when he started the company in 1908. At his factory in Ivrea, he designed and produced the first Italian typewriter. Today the company's head office is still in Ivrea, near Turin, but the company is much larger than it was in those days and there are offices all around the world,\nBy 1930 there was a staff of 700 and the company turned out 13.000 machines a year. Some went to customers in Italy, but Olivetti exported more typewriters to other countries.\nCamillo's son, Adriano, started working for the company in 1924 and later he became the boss. He introduced a standard speed for the production line and he employed technology and design specialist. The company developed new and better typewriters and then calculators . In 1959 it produced the ELEA computer system. This was the first mainframe  computer designed and made in Italy.\nAfter Adriano died in 1960, the company had a period of financial problem. Other companies, especially the Japanese, made faster progress in electronic technology than the Italian company.\nIn 1978, Carlo de Benedetti became the new boss. Olivetti increased its marketing and service networks and made agreements with other companies to design and produce more advanced office equipment. Soon it became one of the world's leading companies in information technology and communications. There are now five independent companies in the Olivetti group--one for personal computers, one for other office equipment, one for systems and service, and two for telecommunications."

      "Knowing that Mrs. Mallard suffered from a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.\nIt was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of \"killed.\" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and hurried to send the sad message.\nShe did not hear the story as many women have heard the same. She wept at once, with wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone.\nThere stood, facing the open window, a comfortable armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul.\nShe could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver   with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves .\nThere was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? It was too hard to name. But she felt it, coming out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the smells, the color that filled the air.\nNow her chest rose and fell violently. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips. She said it over and over under the breath: \"free, free, free!\"\nShe did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, gentle hands folded in death; the face that had never looked at her except with love, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.\nThere would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers.\nAnd yet she had loved him--sometimes. What did it matter! What could love count for in the face of her realization.\n\"Free! Body and soul free!\" she kept whispering.\nJosephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole. \"Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill.\"\n\"Go away. I am not making myself ill.\"\nHer fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her, all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long.\nShe arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister's begging. She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory. She held her sister's waist, and together they walked down the stairs.\nSomeone was opening the front door with a key. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's sharp cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.\nWhen the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills."

      "People in the United States love their dogs and treat them well. They take their dogs for walks, let them play outside and give them good food and medical care. However, dogs without owners to care for lead a different kind of life. The expression, to lead a dog's life, describes a person who has an unhappy existence.\nSome people say we live in a dog-eat-dog world. That means many people are competing for the same things, like good jobs. They say that to be successful, a person has to work like a dog. This means they have to work very, very hard. Such hard work can make people dog-tired. And, the situation would be even worse if they became sick as a dog.\nStill, people say every dog has its day. This means that every person enjoys a successful period during his or her life. To be successful, people often have to learn new skills. Yet, some people say that you can never teach an old dog new tricks. They believe that older people do not like to learn new things and will not change the way they do things.\nSome people are compared to dogs in bad ways. People who are unkind or uncaring can be described meaner than a junkyard dog. Junkyard dogs live in places where people throw away things they do not want. Mean dogs are often used to guard this property. They bark or attack people who try to enter the property. However, sometimes a person who appears to be mean and threatening is really not so bad. We say his bark is worse than his bite.\nHusbands and wives use this doghouse term when they are angry at each other. For example, a woman might get angry at her husband for coming home late or forgetting their wedding anniversary. She might tell him that he is in the doghouse. She may not treat him nicely until he apologizes. However, the husband may decide that it is best to leave things alone and not create more problems. He might decide to let sleeping dogs lie.\nDog expressions also are used to describe the weather. The dog days of summer are the hottest days of the year. A rainstorm may cool the weather. But we do not want it to rain too hard. We do not want it to rain cats and dogs."

      "Children seem to care so much about their names. A study showed that 25% of young children feel they couldn't live any more if you took away their name. Another study shows that about one third of all young people wish their parents had given them a different name.\nIn many cultures, there are special ideas about how to choose a name. For example, many people choose a name that has been in their family for many years. It tells the child where he or she has come from.\nChoosing a good name isn't easy. Many parents search books that tell them the meanings of names. They could choose a name that carries a message. For example, Edith means \"valuable gift\". Amanda means \"love\". And Fara means \"joy\".\nNames like these tell family and friends how happy they are with their new baby. Other names can say something about the events during the birth of the child. In Africa, a first born son may have the name Mosi and the name Ama means \"born on Saturday\".\nBut can our names influence our lives? Some experts say that they can, but others disagree. Is every girl called Malak like an angel? Is every boy called Curitis polite? And is every girl called Mahira quick and full of energy? No parent can tell what kind of person their child will grow up to be. Just because parents name a boy Fahim, it doesn't mean he will be clever. All they can do is to hope."

      "It is named a kind of wooden Eiffel Tower, because of the fact that there was a large wooden platform far out in the lake on which stood an improbably high diving board. It was, I'm sure, the county's tallest wooden structure and no one had ever been known to jump from it.\nSo it was quite a shock when our teacher, Mr. David, announced that he would dive off the high board that very afternoon.\nWord of his questionable plan was already spreading through town as Mr. David swam out to the platform. He was just _ when he got there but even from such a distance the high board seemed almost to touch the clouds. Once at the top, he paced the enormously long board, then took some deep breaths and finally stood at edge. He was going to do it.\nSeveral hundred people had gathered at the shore to watch. Mr. David stood for quite a long time, then he raised his arms, took one massive bounce and launched himself into a perfect dive. It was beautiful. He fell with perfect style for what seemed minutes. The crowd fell silent. The only sound to be heard was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air toward the water far, far below.\nBut about three quarters of the way down he seemed to have second thoughts and began suddenly to panic, waving his arms and legs like someone having a bad dream. When he was perhaps thirty feet above the water, he gave up on waving and spread his arms and legs wide, apparently hoping that it would somehow slow his fall.\nIt didn't.\nHe hit the water at over six hundred miles an hour. The impact was so loud that it made birds fly out of their trees three miles away. I don't think he entered the water at all. He just bounced off it, about fifteen feet back into the air. After that, he lay still on the surface, spinning like an autumn leaf.\nHe was brought to shore by two passing fishermen in a rowboat and placed on an old blanket where he spent the rest of the afternoon. Occasionally he accepted small sips of water, but otherwise was too shocked to speak. From head to toe, he was covered with deep red bruises.\n...\nIt was the best day of my life."

      "At the moment, it may be difficult to imagine, but many people believe that, by the year 2100, we will live on the planet Mars. Our own planet, Earth, is becoming more and more crowed and polluted. Luckily, we can start again and build a better world on Mars. Here is what life could be like.\nFirst of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!\nSecondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.\nThere is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.\nLife on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space. Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible. Many people believe that robot will do most of our work, so we have more time for our hobbies.\nThere will probably be no school on Mars. Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet. They can study, do their homework and take exams in online schools. Each student will also have their own online teacher called \"e-teacher\".\nHowever, in some ways, life on Mars may not be better than that on the earth today. Food will not be the same -- meals will probably be in the form of pills and will not be as delicious as they are today, Also, space travel will make many people feel ill. The spaceship will travel fast but the journey to Mars will probably be very uncomfortable."

      "Faced with a life-changing tragedy, it would be easy for Martha Clements to focus on the negative. But that's not her way. Five years after losing her vision, Clements is back doing what she loves. \n\"It is long, Kathy,\" Clements says, running her hands down the length of her client's hair. Kathy Braga is letting it grow. It now hangs below her shoulders and down her back, and all she wants is a trim , so she asks Clements to show her how much an inch would be. Clements pulls a ruler from a drawer and holds it up to Braga's hair in front near her face. \"Right here. An inch will be right here at your chin.\"\nClements was in this career for about 10 years before losing her vision. Now, when she begins cutting, it's easy to forget that Clements is completely blind. She carefully compares the length of each strand of hair. Though confident of her sense of touch, she at times asks her client to be her eyes and check her work.\nAfter a careful inspection, Braga gives her approval. And after Clements blows her hair dry, she remarks, \"You made me younger. I love it.\"\nClements had been doing Braga's hair for years before she became blind. Braga is proud to say she was Clements' first customer after she lost her vision.\n\"She sat me in the kitchen. It was dark, and she said ,' Are you ready?' I said, 'I'm ready.' And that is when she took this thing, and she said, ' Look and see if there is hair on the ground,' and I said ,' Yes, there is .' And she said, 'Okay, I have the right end of the thing.\" \nClements was 42 years old when she suffered a pulmonary embolism   that cost her sight. \"I was dead for 20 minutes first and then half an hour, and the lack of oxygen killed my optical  nerve.\" The last thing Clements remembered that day was the ambulance coming to get her. \"I couldn't breathe. The next thing I remembered was waking up three days later, blind, in the hospital.\"\nHer ribs had been broken, when they treated her. Her shoulder was dislocated. She had to undergo nine months of physical treatment.\n\"It was the hardest time in my life,\" she says. \"Everything changed in my life: distance, smell, and sound. My kids didn't sound the same. My husband didn't sound the same too. I didn't know my home. It took me three months to find the coffee table.\"\n Once a month, a teacher from the Virginia Center for the Blind came to her home in Woodbridge, about 40 kilometers from Washington. But Clements was eager to learn more. So in 2008, she left her husband and sons, to go to the Virginia School for the Blind in Richmond for a nine-month program. \"My plan was to be able to do for my family again, to do what I like to do, cook, clean, make phone calls.\"\n She learned basic skills like how to walk with a cane, how to listen and how to eat different foods. There were classes in Braille, computer skills and using different gadgets designed for the blind. Graduates of the program are expected to leave with not only life skills, but a marketable skill as well.\n\"My teacher asked me why I wouldn't do hair. I said, ' Hello. Blind. No, no, no.' I was scared  to think I could even do it.\"\nBut gradually, Clements gained confidence and by the time she graduated, had styled 100 heads of hair at the school. \"People from headquarters came, people from the library, students, secretaries, teachers, and friends came. Everybody came and let me do their hair,\" Clements says.\nThree days a week she leaves home to volunteer at the House of Mercy, a Catholic service organization that provides clothing, food and other support to the poor.\nKellie Ross, executive director of the House of Mercy, remembered when Clements first showed up with her friend, Kathy Braga, to offer her help.\nAt first, she had no idea Clements was blind. \"As she started to walk I realized she couldn't see, \" Ross recalls. \"She could have taken that tragic experience of losing her sight and gone inward, but instead she used that experience to help other people who are suffering.\"\nClements says she feels blessed to day, five years after her brush with death. \"I thank the Lord every day for my blindness, because I'm alive,\" she says. \"I could have been dead. I'm alive. I'm healthy, and that is what matters.\""

      "Emily Post was an American writer who became famous for writing the book on correct etiquette  for social behavior in the United States. Before that, she wrote several novels and short stories which sold moderately well in the early 1900s. Then a publisher asked Ms. Post to write a book on suggested etiquette. Many people during this time had  _ through the boom in the American economy just after World War I, but these people were not raised in \"polite society\"; therefore, they did not necessarily have the proper manners. Ms. Post's book was planned to help these new upper-middle class people pass smoothly into their new social circle. She wrote the book, and it became a great success. In fact, it continued to sell well for the next 20 years. Ms. Post began writing a weekly advice column for newspapers, and the column was published in papers across the country. She even had her own radio show for several years. Ms. Post died in 1960, but her book on etiquette is still published with occasional updates under the title \"The Emily Post Book of Etiquette\". Americans continue to turn to this book for advice on the proper behaviour in a variety of social situations.\nOne area in which people in the United States can count on words of wisdom from Ms. Post is in giving gifts. Everyone has to give gifts at some time or another, and Ms. Post explains just what to do in each situation. Whether the occasion is a birthday party for a friend,  , or coworker, there are some basic rules the gift-giver and the receiver should follow.\nGiving money is a common concern among gift-givers. \"When is it proper? When is it rude? Some people see a gift of money as a sign of a gift-giver who is too lazy to go out and find a proper gift. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes money is more appreciated than a gift that the receiver does not need or cannot use. For example, elderly people who must live on a limited income may find a small gift of money as a wonderful present. For those who are uncomfortable giving cash, gift certificates to popular stores may serve as an equally acceptable gift.\nGiving flowers can be a wonderful gift for both men and women. For occasions such as funerals and dinner parties, flowers are often required. When attending a dinner party, a host or hostess may not have the time to run off and find a vase for fresh-cut flowers brought by a thoughtful guest. Bringing the flowers in a prepared vase can save the host or hostess the trouble. Flowers may also be sent ahead of time in order to give the hostess or host time to arrange and display the flowers before the party begins. If a gift of flowers seems too feminine for a man to receive, a plant is another option the gift-giver may consider.\nIn some cases, the person throwing the party may specify  that no gift is needed or wanted. It is common sense that guests should abide  by the wishes of the host or hostess. Guests who ignore the host or hostess and bring a gift may appear rude. The giving of a gift in these situations will only embarrass the host or hostess and the other guests who honored the request of no gifts. Make sure that you are not one of the rule-breakers. Be sure to follow the host's or hostess's suggestion."

      "Researchers at the University of Bedforshire have developed a new technique for powering electronic device . The system, developed by Professor Ben Allen at the Centre for Wireless Research, uses radio waves as power.\nBelieved to be a world first, the team claims it could eventually get rid of the need for conventional batteries. The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.\nProfessor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.\nThe new technique uses the \"waste\" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university's research into \"power harvesting\". Professor Allen said that as radio waves have energy---like light waves, sound waves or wind waves---in theory, these waves could be used to create power.\n\"The new area of power harvesting technology promises to reduce our reliance on conventional batteries,\" he said. \"It's really exciting way of taking power from sources other than what we would normally think of.\"\nThe team is now waiting for the results of the patent application to secure recognition of the technique. Professor Allen said that the team's achievements had all been done in their \"spare time\". \"Our next stage is to try and raise some real funds so that we can take this work forward and make a working pattern and maybe partner up with the right people and take this to a full product in due course,\" he said.\n\"Power harvesting has a really important part in our future, because, just in this country, we leave somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of batteries in landfill sites every single year-that is poisonous chemicals going into the ground.\"\nHe added that development of the product could also be \"commercially  beneficial\". \"The market for this is several billion pounds. We've seen market predictions for 2020 which have these kinds of figures, so there's a lot of commercial potential in this area,\" he said.\nPro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Bedfordshire, Professor Carsten Maple said, \"This type of work is a reflection of the university's growing reputation and experience in carrying out creating research.\""

      "I arrived in the classroom,ready to share my knowledge and experience with 76 students who would be my English literature class. Having taught in the US for 17 years,I have no doubt about my ability to hold their attention and to impress on them my admiration for the literature of my mother tongue.\n    I was shocked when the monitor shouted, \"stand up!\" The entire class rose as I entered the room and l was somewhat confused about how to get them to sit down again,but once the embarrassment  was over, I quickly regained my calmness and admiration. I went back to my office with the rosy glow which came from a strong sense of achievement.\n    My students kept diaries. However, as I read them the rosy glow was gradually replaced by a strong sense of sadness.The first diary said, \"Our literature teacher didn't teach us anything today perhaps her next lecture will be better.\" Greatly surprised.I read diary after diary, each expressing a similar theme. \"Didn't I teach them anything? I described the entire Western  _ and laid the historical background for all the works we will study in class,\" I complained. \"How should they say I didn't teach them anything?\"\n    It was a long term, and it gradually became clear that my ideas about education were not the same as those of my students. I thought a teacher's job was to raise interesting questions and provide enough background so that students could draw their own conclusions. My students thought a teacher's job was to provide exact information as directly and clearly as possible. What a difference!\n    However, I also learned a lot,and the experience with my Chinese students has made me a better American teacher, knowing how to teach in a different culture."

      "It goes without saying that human intelligence is very advanced as opposed to plants and other living creatures. People's capacity to fully understand, reason, organize, solve problems, display emotional intelligence, learn, communicate and think abstractly is outstanding. It is believed to be much more emphasized   nowadays, when bright folks are normally one level higher than everyone else.\nNowadays many people are of the view that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is an excellent assistance in pulling through life. Statistics reveal that whatever activity enabling the brain to function and operate, no matter whether in the form of difficulties or other obstacles   that can be overcome by this specific body area, has a positive effect on it.\nSo every time you are making full use of your mind for right answers in a quick crossword or if you are answering difficult riddles, you might be, in fact, raising the probabilities of increasing your intelligence. You could play effective brain games like crosswords, chess, riddles, puzzles, Internet games, word games and other games. These are useful in raising your intelligence primarily because they let you think in a different way as you make an effort to uncover answers to certain problems. Aside from this, this form of brain training continually encourages the brain to function and widen its capacity to concentrate and learn.\nNeedless to say, you've to make sure that you make the most of these brain exercises by not cheating yourself. Lastly, if you progress to a much more complicated level, try your best to answer difficult problems with no hints or clues so that you are able to further force your brain to work on its own."

But as a tour guide, his time with his family is destined to be very limited.\nAli Dede Coskuner said, \"Tour guide is no timing; you don't have fixed time to work.

And his smiling face always makes him an _ host for his guests.\nAccording to Ali, there are about 10 thousand tour guides throughout Turkey, with only five thousand who are active. Because of certain legal loopholes , not all the tour guides are licensed professionals, which results in some unfair competition. At the same time, tour guiding in Turkey is still not recognized as a profession, so guides are not included in the country's insurance system."

All you have to do is to sit around and wait for your meals.There's catch, however.You have to stay in a chicken cage with a stranger for a whole week.There are no books or television or radio for amusement.You can't leave until the week is up.And a camera will be recording your every move.\nTwo people actually took the job.The idea came from Rob Thompson, a video artist.He wanted to make a film about the way animals are treated.His goal was to raise people's awareness of the living conditions of animals that are raised for food.He decided to pay $ 5000 out of his own savings to two people who were willing to lie like chicken for a week.\nTo Rob's surprise, quite a few people answered his advertisement.He had interviews and selected Eric, a 24-year-old restaurant worker, and Pam, a 27-year-old chemist.The plan was for them to spend seven days together in a chicken cage that was six feet long and three feet wide.A camera would record their experience, which would take place in an art museum.\nThe week was long and difficult.They slept on a hard wooden floor.They couldn't stand up without banging their heads.They ate vegetarian mash and drank water from a garden hosepipe .Their only privacy was a toilet surrounded by a curtain.There were no sinks, mirrors, or toothbrushes in the cage.Their only inspiration was the two framed checks that hung on the wall outside the cage.Visitors who came here were warned, \"Do not food the humans.\"\nFinally it was over, Pam and Eric emerged from their cage.They had survived the week, and they each had a $2,500 check in their hands.When Rob Thompson opened the cage, Eric came out, changed into clean clothes, and ate a chocolate bar right away.\"It's great to be able to stand up,\" he said.Pam just changed her clothes and left.After a week of visitors and reporters watching her, she didn't want to talk to anyone."

      "Before a new type airplane goes service, every part of it is tested again and again. But there are two tests that are more of into important than the others.\nThe first is called the \"tank test\". A modern airplane must fly very high in the sky. Air must be pumped into the plane so that the passengers can breathe. The metal structure of the plane has to be very strong for this reason. When the plane is filled with air, the air presses against the skin of the plane inside. The pressure on a small window is like a huge foot that is trying to get out. If a small part of the plane were to fail, the plane would explode in the sky. To test the structure of the plane, the plane is lowered into a huge tank or container of water. Then it is filled with air. The pressure inside the plane is greater than it ever will be when it is high up in the air. Finally, there is an explosion. This does not cause so much damage inside the water tank as it would anywhere else. Engineers can discover which part of the plane has broken. Then that part is made stronger.\nThe most dangerous test happens when the new plane is going through test flights in the air. The test must find out exactly what happens when the engines  are all shut off at once. The plane begins to fall like a stone. It is the pilot's job to find out how he can get control of the plane again. These two tests are examples of how planes are made safe before they ever carry passengers."

      "Almost every machine with moving parts has wheels,yet no one knows exactly when the first wheel was invented or what it was used for.We do know,however,that they existed over 5,500 years ago in ancient Asia.\nThe oldest known transport wheel was discovered in 2002 in Slovenia.It is over 5,100 years old.Evidence suggests that wheels for transport didn't become popular for a while,though.This could be because animals did a perfectly good job of carrying farming tools and humans around.\nBut it could also be because of a difficult situation.While wheels need to roll on smooth surfaces,roads with smooth surfaces weren't going to be constructed until there was plenty of demand for them.Eventually,road surfaces did become smoother,but this difficult situation appeared again a few centuries later.There had been no important changes in wheel and vehicle design before the arrival of modern road design.\nIn the mid1700s,a Frenchman came up with a new design of road--a base layer  of large stones covered with a thin layer of smaller stones.A Scotsman improved on this design in the 1820s and a strong,lasting road surface became a reality.At around the same time,metal hubs (the central part of a wheel)came into being,followed by the pneumatic tyre  in 1846.Alloy wheels were invented in 1967,sixty years after the appearance of tarmacked roads .As wheel design took off,vehicles got faster and faster.

If you are sitting at a table with people you don't know, it is impolite to light up a cigarette without asking if it will trouble them.\nAt American restaurant and coffee shops you are usually served cold water before you order. You may find the bread and butter is free, and if you order coffee, you may get a free refill .\nMost cities and towns have no rules about opening and closing time for stores or restaurants, though they usually do make rules for bars. Especially in large cities, stores may be open 24 hours a day.\nServing in restaurant is often large, too large for many people. If you can't finish your meal but would like to enjoy the food later, ask your waitress or waiter for a \"doggie bag\". It may have a picture of a dog on it, but everyone knows you're taking the food for yourself. Supper and dinner are both words for the evening meal. Some people have \"Sunday dinner\". This is an especially big noon meal.\nTips are not usually added to the check. They are not included in the price of the meal, either. A tip of about 15% of the price of a meal is expected and you should leave it on the table when you leave. In some restaurants, a check is brought on a plate and you put your money there.

      "3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back In 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.\nBut since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. Although sound was added to movies in the late 1920s, it took audiences time to get used to the new technology. But in the end, sound and color became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.\nSome say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch , a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.\nBut James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.\nWho knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, 'Tm hoping 3D gets to a point where people dorft notice it. Because then it just becomes another tool and helps tell a story.\""

      "A mother from Colorado who doctors said had died while giving birth to her son, has said it is a Christmas miracle that both she and the boy are alive.\nTracey Hermanstorfer's heart stopped beating and her son Coltyn appeared lifeless after the Caesarean section on Christmas Eve. However a few minutes after he was born, both began breathing again. Dr Stephanie Martin told Good Morning America she could not explain how the pair survived. Mrs Hermanstorfer and her husband Mike told the American television show that their baby was now healthy and that they were doing \"good\" following the drama at Colorado Springs Memorial Hospital.\nThe couple, who already had two children, had to go into the hospital seven weeks earlier than planned. Her husband, 37, said his wife was tired after receiving an epidural during the labour but after closing her eyes, she \"wasn't waking up\".She stopped breathing and she is believed to have suffered a heart attack before her heart stopped beating entirely.\nDr Martin said she was called in and that the outlook was grim since in most situations like this,\"despite the best efforts of the team\", the mother was often unable to be revived. In that case doctors then tried to focus on delivering the baby but when he was born he was \"completely lifeless\".\nMr Hermanstorfer told the Associated Press news agency,\"I had everything in the world taken from me, and in an hour and a half I had everything given to me.\"\nDr Martin said she did not have a \"great explanation\" for why Mrs Hermanstorfer's heartbeat returned. \"Somewhere between four and five minutes she had been without heart rate and had stopped breathing a minute or two prior to her heart stopping,\" she said. The doctors were then able to bring the baby back to life, and the mother was alive after that.\nDespite tests, she said doctors were still not sure about what had happened. However Mrs Hermanstorfer and her husband Mike have said they believed it was down to a miracle. She said:\"I got a second chance in life.\""

      "Egypt: Bridging the Gap between School English and Real English\nTeaching English in Egypt in general and in my town Damietta in particular, is mainly directed towards helping students to pass their final exams. Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students."

      "The bar-tailed godwit  has just broken its own record for the world's longest non-stop flight, including humans in planes, according to a report made by Lund University Press. The bird can fly non-stop for eight days, while the most impressive man-made airplane can only remain in the sky for 82 hours without a stop.\nThe bar-tailed godwit's journey, from Alaska to New Zealand, covers over 6,835 miles. It completes this trip twice a year, in autumn going to New Zealand, and in spring back to Alaska. The tireless bird ends the trip without stopping once for food or rest. All other birds can only finish trips that are twice as short as what the bar-tailed godwit travels.\nOne reason for the bar-tailed godwit's success is that it has made the best use of its fuel, which is only 0.41 percent of its body weight over each hour of any given long flight. Hedenstrom, a professor from Lund University, says, \"This figure is extremely low compared with other birds.\" The bird also has a special body shape that helps it fly easily. It stores body fat and protein to manage its trips. It also travels fast, compared to other birds and animals.\nMany questions remain about this bird record holder that never gets lost in the air. Researchers wonder whether it has an inside compass  that helps it to know the direction. Please watch how beautiful bar-tailed godwits look as they come in for a landing, along with other birds."

      "Going to the beach is many American's favorite activity. They went swimming in the ocean without giving a thought to what was underwater. But those days are long gone. In the summer of 1988, many of the beaches had to be closed because garbage from hospitals was found in the water. The garbage included glass bottles with samples of blood, and people were afraid they might get AIDS from the blood. At some beaches, sewage was found in the water. Americans were shocked by this state of affairs. People didn't think of the underwater garbage because it was out of sight.\nSome of the most polluted waters still look beautiful. San Francisco Bay is a good example of a beautiful bay that's full of chemicals. Scientists discovered pollution in some lakes and rivers when they found fish with rotting skin. People are told not to eat too much fish because of pollution. Most American cities put their garbage in the ground. But New York and a few other cities put their garbage in the ocean. Boston Harbor is so polluted that scientists say it won't recover until the next century. The government has ordered the city to build a sewage treatment plant, Cleaning up oceans won't be easy, but people can no longer ignore this challenge."

With a social worker mother, the Sutton children. had inherited her commitment to service, and knew never to take their good fortune at Christmas for granted. This year, Kinzie, her seven-year-old daughter was thrilled that Santa Claus would make a special visit to a 22-year-old mother named Ashley who worked in a factory raising her 12-month-old son by herself.\nThe phone rang on Sunday. A representative from a local organization was calling to say that the aid Ann had requested for Ashley had fallen through. No Santa Claus, no presents, nothing.\nAnn saw the cheer fade away from her children's faces at the news.  Without a word, Kinzie ran into her bedroom. She returned,  her face set with determination.\nOpening up her piggy bank, she put all the coins onto the table:  $3.30.  Everything she had.\n\"Mom,\" she told Ann, \"I know it's not much. But maybe this will buy a present for the baby.\"\nAt a breakfast meeting the next day, Ann told her coworkers about her daughter story. To her surprise, staff members began to open their purses. and empty  their pockets to help Kinzie .On Christmas Eve, Ann drove through the pouring rain to the small trailer where the Ashley's lived. Then she began to unload the gifts from the car, handing them to Ashley one by one.\nAshley was very moved. Reflecting on a little girl's generosity, Ashley says she'll one day be able to do something similar for someone else in need.  \"Kinzie could have used that money for herself, but she gave it away,\" Ashley says. \"She's the  type of kid I'd like my son to  grow up to be.\""

      "Now scientists believe that global warming affects hibernating animals, causing them to wake up earlier. While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect. Terry Root, an animal expert at Stanford University, said, \"I do think what we will be facing is the extinction of many species.\""

      "Everything in China is negotiable, so goes the saying, reminding foreign travelers to be on guard and avoid being overcharged. Foreign tourists are often advised to learn some bargaining skills so that they can avoid paying high prices. Generally speaking, bargaining is an art and an important part of people's life in China.\nBut the younger generation is gradually losing interest and the ability to negotiate a better deal. With fatter wallets, young people who never experienced war or shortages seldom bother to spend 10 minutes at a roadside shop cutting the price of a cell phone cover by 1 yuan. Saving for a rainy day and making good use of every penny---values held dear by older generations---no longer seem necessary. Naturally, bargaining is out, in an increasingly rich society. In this sense, bargaining is a product of poverty.\nBut in many countries, where residents' incomes are much lower than those in China, bargaining is not popular at all. I can still remember my failed bargaining attempts in Africa and Indonesia, where vendor  looked at me in surprise when I sought something at half the price. They shook their heads and stopped the negotiation. Latter I was told by friends who had been staying there for years that bargaining was not part of local commercial culture.\nDuring the years when the planned economy changed into the market economy, it was difficult for ordinary buyers to get a full picture of the product prices at a time when travel was inconvenient, and information spread slowly, adding to the information asymmetry . Afraid of being overcharged by vendors, buyers turned to the old wisdom of bargaining whenever and wherever they could.\nNowadays, the popularity of e-commerce has improved pricing transparence  to the extreme. With the click of a mouse, all kinds of information on a product can be found, with users' comments helping new consumers make decisions. With such transparency, overpricing becomes less frequent and bargaining is not a necessity for shoppers. In this sense, reduced bargaining activity can be seen as a sign of China's progress toward a more mature economy."

      "The preventive measures for forest fires include some preemptive methods that can help reduce the risks of fires and control their severity and spread,and thus, maintain ecological balance and protect resources.Close monitoring of forest fires caused by natural factors can help prevent their spread to a large extent.To contain forest fires,fire departments usually use water and chemical fire retardants that can be dropped from planes and helicopters.To control the spread of a wildfire.firefighters usually create a control line by removing all fuel from an area so that the fire cannot travel across it.\nControlled burns are often employed by government authorities to reduce fuel buildup,and clean up the fallen leaves,and thus,prevent the spread of forest fires to a vast area.Regular controlled burns can also help maintain biodiversity ,as the smoke and heat produced in the process can facilitate the growth of seeds of certain plant species.Apart from these,responsible human behavior can help reduce the number of forest fires to a great extent.In fact,we can reduce the number of wildfires dramatically by not leaving behind any source of fire in the forest.\nForest fires can affect climate and weather to a great extent,besides causing severe damage to valuable trees.Wildfires can increase the level of greenhouse gases(water vapor, carbon dioxide,etc),and therefore increase pollution and global warming.However, they are also an important part of the ecosystem,and many plants depend on the heat and smoke generated by wildfires for their growth and reproduction.But large wildfires can cause extensive damage to the ecosystem,which again highlights the importance of effective control and prevention of forest fires*"

      "The man with the bullhorn encouraged the runners as they made their way up the hill. \"Two hours, fifteen minutes, forty seconds ...\"His deep, loud voice boomed toward us.\nIt was mile 17 of the marathon.\n\"Hey, great stride!\" a bearded viewer yelled to me. He clapped loudly. \"You're looking strong. Keep going--go, go, go!\"\nYou bet I'm looking strong, I thought, as I followed my younger sister, Laura. I just got started. She had been diligently clocking eight-minute miles since the race had begun downtown. Initially in the middle of a pack, which was several thousand people, she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so. We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St. Cecelia Bridge. Once we crossed, we would begin heading back into town, running along the east side of the Rincon River. Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her. Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk, and with no experience running in organized events, I figured I might be good for two or three miles.\nUp ahead, steel drums were playing. A group of drummers was beating their drums, chanting, and encouraging us with their music and smiles. Crossing the bridge, I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook. During my preview of the route, it had seemed like a babyish thing to do. But now it seemed like a fine idea, and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge.\n\"I read the handbook, too!\" said a woman behind me, who also let loose over the side of the bridge. We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters. It was quite a sight, but I had other things to occupy my attention, namely the back of Laura's sweater.\nEasing off the bridge, and heading south on Avila Boulevard, Laura and I found our pace together again. Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation. \"You keeping up okay?\" she asked. Being her older brother, and therefore unable to admit weakness, I nodded convincingly.\n\"Hey, Lee!\" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk. Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew, I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie-dyed clothing to a road race of this size. It made it a lot easier to be spotted!\nThe town marathon is a \"people's\" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair, with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere. I managed to run six miles before bowing out, and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours. I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon. The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant. If pressed, however, I'll admit that I only ran one-fourth of one.\nInspired by this year's experience, I plan to walk the course--really fast--next year. It's not because I'm jealous of my sister's accomplishment. This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does. Rather, Laura got free cookies at the finish line, and the promise of that will lead me to any goal."

      "This is the age of the quick action. We have instant satisfaction, fast food, speed reading, mobile phones; even the stress management books have titles like \"Stress Management in 60 Seconds\".\nCanadian Classics Professor Margaret Visser points out that the perception that we have \"no time\" is one of the most strict concepts of Western culture. Visser says that \"no time\" is used as an excuse and also as a spur ; it both stimulates us and forces us, just as a concept such as 'honour' did for the ancient Greeks. According to Visser, the feeling that Westerners have \"no time\" is abstract, quantitative, amoral , unarguable, bringing pressure on each person as an individual. At the same time, the \"no time\" excuse escapes\nby claiming to be a condition created entirely out of our good fortune.\nLife offers \"so many pleasures, so many choices\".\nThe fact that women now work outside the home has contributed to the \"no time\" trend. But more important, Visser says, is the fact that feeling rushed has become an important component  of our economy. Marketing of \"time-saving\" products causes people to buy more and work longer. So we eat out or buy prepared food to save time. The fax-it-to-my-car technology only contributes to the constant hurry. In our rushed and exhausted state, even the obligation  to sit down to casual meal with family seems like a pressure. In comparison with the decision to act on a sudden whimz   to consume a microwave mug of soup, the act of eating together and not getting up from the table until everyone else has finished seems an incredibly time-consuming event. Being in one's own personal hurry in the West is somehow \"free and preferable\""

      "Children have their own rules in playing games. They seldom need a judge and rarely trouble to keep scores. They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.\nGrown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.\nIt appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules. Those rules may be childish, but they make sure that every child has a chance to win."

      "Do you know of anyone who uses the truth to deceive   ? When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.\nFor example , some might say, \"I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! \"\nThis guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!\nHe didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.\nSome politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, \" During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !\" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , \"During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. \"\nAdvertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, \"Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache.\" It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.\nThis kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well."

      "The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history that has so far killed almost 1000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria in West Africa has caused fear around the world.\nThe outbreak is unprecedented both in infection numbers and in geographic scope. Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this month the outbreak \"is moving faster than our efforts to control it\", reported CNN. So far, the battle against the virus doesn't appear to be slowing down.\nThe Ebola virus is terrifying no matter where it strikes: It's a disease with no cure that causes headaches and fever, severe diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding and has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims.\nIt is understandable for people to be panicked, but those living outside Africa shouldn't be particularly concerned about contracting the virus, says aWashington Postarticle.\nThis is because transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with an infected person's blood, vomit or other bodily fluids during the period that he or she is contagious . It is something that is extremely unlikely for anyone but healthcare workers. The virus is not spread by coughing or sneezing.\nMedia outlets in the US and the UK are using terrifying headlines, wrongly claiming that people infected with the virus have traveled to their countries.\nJames Ball atThe Guardiansays the Ebola outbreak in Africa is tragic, but it is important to _ Other infectious diseases, including common influenza, are far, far deadlier."

      "When I first arrived in Taiwan to teach English, I had already taken several courses in university on Mandarin Chinese. I had done well in those courses and enjoyed them very much. I thought I would be able to have a conversation with Chinese speakers and improve my Chinese in the process.\nHowever, as soon as I settled in Taiwan I became afraid to speak. Seeing all of the signs written in Chinese, constantly overhearing long streams of spoken Chinese, and seeing the effortless fluency of some foreigners who had been there for a while, I began to doubt my own ability to speak Chinese. It's proved that things were different outside of the classroom.\nWhat really happened to me was what happens every day to Chinese language learners. I became afraid and nervous at the foreignness of the language. Something happened a few weeks later. I tried to spend a lot of time in public, and the sound of spoken Chinese was becoming more ordinary to me. Despite the fact that I had not been practicing my Chinese and I had not consulted my vocabulary flashcards. I begin to notice some words that I recognized from my courses in university. At first, I heard only one word. \"dianhua\"- telephone. After that, I begin hearing other words. Sometimes, I would hear a couple of words in one sentence.\nMore and more words began to stand out to me. I started studying Chinese characters and began to be able to read small blocks of text in the advertisements. When I really began speaking in Chinese to Chinese people I met, I began to learn Chinese fast and the smiles that I received in return were a fantastic reward for the work that I had done in learning the language. It was a great feeling to order food from a restaurant in Chinese, or to make a comment about the weather to the lady who works at the bank."

      "I vividly remember walking back to my house after collecting the afternoon mails. I saw a credit card statement, another credit card statement and our bank statements. It was in that moment that I felt a deep tension.\nI realized that even though I had married a man who I absolutely loved and adored, I really didn't have a clear sense of how he handled money and how the two of us were going to combine our different approaches to handling money in our marriage. I was more organized and detailed, but he was more of a _ type. I knew that getting on the same financial page was a key factor in creating a successful marriage and financial future.\nI asked my husband if he would be willing to set up a time each week to talk about our finances and develop a plan for getting rid of our credit card debt. My husband said he would be willing to do this. Admittedly, he was skeptical -- but willing.\nWe came to refer to our weekly meetings as our Financial Dates. We didn't really have a clue as to what we were doing. All we knew was that we needed to give our finances serious attention. Some Dates were filled with tense conversations. Other Dates were filled with laughter, joy and creativity. However, we kept showing up for our Dates and we never gave up. What started out as a means for survival became a powerful connecting thread in our relationship. Something shifted within us.\nInstead of our finances becoming a source of divisive tension that pulled us apart, they became\nthe glue that held us together as we became a unified team.\nI still recall the day that we excitedly crossed off our last credit card payment on the chart we had created. We had finally arrived. We were free. We had been given wings to fly.\nNow, whenever I feel huge stress I ask myself, \"How am I contributing to what is happening right now?\" This gives me the ultimate power to take action. Even though my husband and I don't have any guarantee against future challenges, I am left with something deep within that is unshakable and that can never be taken away -- the memory of our past successes and the power to integrate   these lessons in my day-to-day life."

      "We might like to think we're not influenced by other people, but a new study into the group-buying mechanisms  - like those used on coupon  sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial - reveals that telling buyers who come later to the offer how many have already signed up increases the number of purchasers.\nResearchers at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management wanted to understand why group buying sites that have entered the market recently have enjoyed greater success than those operating a decade ago, such as Mercata and MobShop.\nEarlier attempts typically left potential buyers waiting for days before confirming whether or not they had got the offer they had signed up for.\n\"We think one of the reasons group-buying has been successful recently is because of the short time horizon,\" says Rotman Professor Ming Hu, who co-wrote the study with Professor Mengze Shi and PhD student Jiahua Wu. \"It allows for a herding effect.\"\nAnother reason is the use of an information structure that discloses to later arrivals how many have already signed onto the deal.\nResearchers looked at two ways of designing the purchasing mechanism for a group buy:a simultaneous mechanism, where no one knows how many buyers have come before them, and asequential  mechanism, where a second group of buyers has the advantage of knowing the size of the first group.\nThe researchers' analytical  model shows the most successful mechanism is the sequential one because it _ uncertainty for those coming later to the deal, and improves the confidence of those who sign on early, as they're able to track the numbers of those who come after them.\n\"That boosts confidence,\" says Professor Hu, who teaches operations management. Deals for \"luxury\" services, versus everyday items, work better in a group buy scenario  because they offer consumers a greater benefit."

It is Cambodia's best-known tourist attraction and is famed for its beautiful architecture and reliefs. You'll need at least three days to fully discover the delights of this magnificent site.\nMachu Picchu, Peru\nMachu Picchu was built high in the Andes Mountains of South America by the Inca in the 15th century. Although well preserved its exact purpose is unknown. It is famous throughout the world not only for its incredible design but also for the natural beauty that surrounds it. Give yourself a week to explore this magnificent site.\nStonehenge, England\nThe entire Stonehenge site was constructed over thousands of years. But why and how it was built remains a mystery. As the weather can be pretty bleak in winter and the crowds huge in summer, we suggest autumn should be the best time to visit these monster rocks.\nPompeii, Italy\nWhen Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., Pompeii was buried under many layers of ash, preserving the city exactly as it was when the volcano erupted. Because so many objects were preserved, scientists and visitors are able to better understand daily life in the ancient Roman Empire."

      "As early as 1894, the newly-formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) considered ice skating as a possibility for the first modern Olympic Games which would be held in 1896.\nIn 1911, a member of the IOC suggested that winter sports should be staged as part of the 1912 Olympics in Helsinki. Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914. After 1920, the national governing bodies for winter sports in several countries began talking about the possibility of a separate Winter Olympics.\nThe town of Chamonix, in the French Alps, planned to hold a winter sports festival in 1924, at the same time Paris was to host the Olympics. The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an \"Olympic winter carnival\".\nThe festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating. Charles Jewtraw from the United States won the first gold medal, in the 500-meter speed skating, but the festival's hero was Claus Thunberg from Finland. He won five medals, three of which were gold, in speed skating.\nWeather has often been a major story at the Winter Olympics, and so it was at Chamonix. The festival opened with rain and unseasonably warm temperature that turned snow and ice to mud. Then temperature dropped as far as 25 below zero and the mud became ice.\nDespite  the weather, more than 10,000 people showed up. At its yearly meeting in 1925, the IOC recognized the Chamonix festival as the first Winter Olympics and decided that the Winter Games would be held every four years, just like the Summer Olympics."

      "Janelle was running late for work, so she just had time for a quick look at herself in the mirror as she was going out. What she saw there made her stop dead in her tracks.\nBeing a busy college student just one year removed from her teenage years, she wasn't exactly obsessive-compulsive  about the neatness of her clothes. But her boss at the restaurant where she works saw things a little differently. He had recently lectured the entire staff on the importance of appearance, and had specifically mentioned the need for servers to wear clean, unwrinkled blouses. As an assistant manager, Janelle felt it was important to set an example for the other employees. But if she stopped to iron the blouse normally, she would be late --and work without delay was an area of even greater concern to her boss.\nSo she grabbed her iron and plugged it in and set it for low heat. Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it. It seemed like a logical answer to an urgent problem.\nAnd it seemed to be working until Janelle tried to iron the collar and accidentally ironed her neck by mistake. Then it suddenly seemed like a really stupid idea and a really painful one as well. It took more time to treat her burn than it would have taken to iron her shirt properly. And she spent a miserable shift dealing with the pain of the burn.\nWe've all been there, haven't we? For me it was cutting my own hair. For a former roommate it was trying to pull his own wisdom teeth. For another college acquaintance, it was trying to change the oil in his car while the motor was still running.\n\"There's a right way and a wrong way of doing things,\" Dad used to tell me whenever I'd spoil the look of our yard by trying out a faster, easier and more creative way of pulling weeds or edging the lawn. \"If a thing is worth doing,\" he said, \"it's worth doing it right.\" There's a reason why certain things are done in certain ways.

      "A few months ago as I wandered through my parents' house, the same house I grew up in, I had a sudden, scary realization. When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I'd still be living in almost 30 years later.\n    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there's no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn't want to. I'm not sure where I'll be living in two years, or what kind of job I'll have. And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.\n    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they'd gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.\n    My friends and I - \"Generation Y\" - still aren't sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we're happy doing it. We'd rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.\n    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.\n    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn't apply to my generation.\n    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents' generation did.  \nBy Ariel Lewiton"

      "According to a recent study out of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, men with shaved heads are considered to be more manly, powerful, and successful than those with longer hair or thinning  hair. Besides, in some cases, they are considered to have greater leadership potential  . That may explain why the power-buzz look has become popular among business leaders in recent years.\nAlbert Mannes, Wharton management lecturer, said he was encouraged to do the research after noticing that he was treated with more respect when he shaved off his thinning hair.\nMannes did three experiments to test people's impression of men with shaved heads. In one of the experiments, he showed 344 subject photos of the same men in two versions: one showing the men with hair and the other showing them with their hair digitally removed, so their heads appear shaved. In all three tests, the subject report found the men with shaved heads are more dominant  than their hairy counterparts .\nThe study found that men with thinning hair were viewed as the least attractive and powerful. For those men, _ .\nNew York image consultant Julie Rath advised her clients to get closely cropped when they start thinning up top. \"There is something really strong, powerful and confident about laying it all bare ,\" she said, describing the thinning look as kind of raunchy .\nNot everyone needs a bare head. Rick Devine, 55, the CEO of Devine Capital Partners, advised executive candidates attracted by their clippers to keep their hair closely cropped, rather than completely shaved. \"It is way too much image risk,\" he said, \"The best thing you can do in a business meeting is to make your look not an issue.\""

He could, for instance, remember which brand of tea Mrs. Smith usually bought or what sort of washing-powder Mrs. Jones preferred. Not only was the shop a center of buying and selling, but also a social meeting place.\nA prosperous general store might have employed four or five assistants, and so there were very few problems in management as far as the staff was concerned. But now that the supermarket has replaced the general store, the job of the manager has changed completely. The modern supermarket manager has to cope with a staff as many as a hundred, apart from all the other everyday problems of running a large business.\nEvery morning, the manager must, like the commander of an army division, carry out an inspection of his store to make sure that everything is ready for the business of the day. He must see that everything is running smoothly. He will have to give advice and make decisions as problems arise, and he must know how to get his huge staff to work efficiently with their respective responsibilities.\nNo matter what he has to do throughout the day, however, the supermarket manager must be ready for any emergency that may arise.

      "During the years after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, structural engineers have been trying hard to solve a question that would otherwise have been completely unthinkable: Can building be designed to stand catastrophic blasts   by terrorists?\n       Soon after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, structural engineers from the University at Buffalo and the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) traveled to ground zero as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. They spent two days beginning the task of formulating   ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing.\n       \"Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,\" said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. \"Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,\" he added.\n       Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. \"This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column   there that used to be part of that building,\" explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. \"The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.\"\n       The visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing   system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris   to survive. \"Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance,\" he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\" said A. Whittaker. \"We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it.\"\n       A. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that \"earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.\""

      "Mobile phone users will be able to charge their devices wirelessly for the first time from 2015.\nFujitsu, the Japanese technology company, has created a system capable of charging quite a few portable electronic devices in the meanwhile, such as mobile phones, digital cameras and laptop computers without the need for cable connections. Electric cars users may also eventually be able to charge their vehicles wirelessly using the same technology according to Fujitsu, which presented a system at an Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers Conference at Osaka Prefecture University.\nClaiming to be the world's first of its kind, the technology works on the basis of the transmission of electricity using magnetic fields between the charger and the electronic device. The system enables wireless charging at distances of up to several metres, with the final aim of installing public \"charging spots\" on the streets in order to enable easy charging around the clock.\nScientists at Fujitsu Laboratories are planning to commercially sell products including the new wireless charging system as early as 2012 but did not make it clear how much they would cost. \"This technology makes it possible to add compact wireless charging functions into mobile phones and enabling several portable devices to be charged at the same time without any restrictions on their position in association with the charger,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe growing popularity of portable electronic devices ranging from iPads to e-readers is expected to fuel a boom in wireless recharging technology developments over the coming decade. \nMobile phone users in Japan can currently fill up their batteries using disposable portable plug-in battery-operated devices -- available at most train stations and convenience stores -- although phone companies warn any use for too long can damage the phones.\nThe new system displayed by Fujitsu, however, is significantly advanced and represents the next generation of portable recharging systems using highly tuned wireless technology. The company added, \"We are also looking at applying the results of this work to fields other than portable electronics, including power transmission between circuit boards or computer chips, and providing mobile charging systems for electric cars.\""

      "Body language is a very powerful tool of a communication, not only between people but in the animal world as well.\nIn many instances, we produce idioms which are all understandable by borrowing examples from animal communication.\nFor example, we know that a frightened cat will arch . From this starting-point we might hear the expression. \"He gets my back up!\" meaning \"He makes me angry.\"\nIn the same manner, we know that many animals, if challenged by attackers, will not turn and run away because this will encourage the attackers to attack them more forcefully. Instead, they will move backwards slowly to get out of harm's way, always facing their attacker. We call this action \"backing off\" and it can be used as well with humans as with animals.\nIn the case of humans, however, the back-off may not be physical but oral, as in using a kinder tone of voice and gentle words instead of fighting against the attackers."

      "Strange stones of prefix = st1 /Costa Rica\nOne of the strangest mysteries in archaeology was discovered in the Diquis River Delta, in southern Costa Rica. Since the 1930s, hundereds of stone balls have been found. They range in size from a few centimetres to over two metres. Who made these perfect spheres   and how they made them remains a mystery. Some researchers believe the stones were made by extreme heating followed by cooling. People could have  _ the spheres with sand or leather. The ancient Costa Ricans had no written language so there is no written record of just how they made the spheres, Almost all are made of granite  , a hard stone created by volcanoes. The granite quarries   were 25 to 30 miles away from the largest stones, which weigh more than 10 tons each. Nobody knows how people moved them. Many of the stones have been found near the remains of houses or graves. Some believed that the stones contained hidden treasures and a few have been smashed but nothing has been found inside. Despite these losses, the National Museum of Costa Rica has recorded 130 spheres. However, many stones are not included because they have been removed from their original sites and used as ornaments  in homes, gardens and churches. Clearly, there are also many stones that lie undiscovered."

      "Virgin Galactic said its first passenger flights wouldn't occur before 2013. Richard Branson's space tourism venture said it hoped to launch the service in two years, but even that date wasn't fixed. The firm's commercial director, Stephen Attenborough, told the BBC that its customers?safety was vital. Test flights are currently under way, with rocket-powered tests scheduled to start next year.\nAlmost 500 people have bought tickets. Richard had originally hoped the first commercial spacecraft, Spaceship Two, would take off as early as 2007. However, Mr. Attenborough stressed there never was an official date set for the first launch.\nStephen Attenborough criticized some press reports, particularly an article in the Wall Street Journal, which described the 2013 goal as ''yet another delay\".\n\"This is a programme that can?t have a hard-end date as safety is number one priority ,\"Mr. Attenborough said, \"Our foot is flat on the gas. We have proven technology, we have a spaceport that opened last week, and the test flight programme is well advanced -----I don't think you can ask for a lot more from a programme like this. A delay is a strange word, and there is no delay. \"\nKeith Colmer, a former Air Force test pilot, was chosen from more than 500 applicants ,among them a handful of astronauts. The BBC,s Richard Scott was the first journalist to be allowed inside the Virgin Galactic spaceship.\nRichard has held an official ceremony for the launch pad for the space tourism venture in the New Mexico desert on 18,October. He plans to take the first flight, accompanied by his children.\nMr. Attenborough said that although all of the future tourists were eager to take off to space, none were pushing for an early flight. \"They are willing to put a large a- mount of money up front because they trust us, because they know we will only take them to space if it's safe to do so,\" he said.\nThe 2. 5-hour flights will offer five minutes of weightlessness. Tickets cost $ 200,000."

      "In 1993, New York State ordered stores to charge money on beverage   containers. Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material."

      "Professional footballers have worryingly poor teeth that could be affecting their performance on the football ground, say dentists. Their study on players at eight clubs in England and Wales, in the British Journal o f Sports Medicine, showed nearly 4 out of 10 had cavities   and that athletes often had worse teeth than the general population. Regularly taking sugary foods is one possible explanation.\nThe dentists, from the International Centre for Evidence-Based Oral Health at University College London, examined 187 players' sets of teeth. They found 53% had dental erosion  , 45% were bothered by the state of their teeth and 7% said it affected their ability to train or play. Around 40% had cavities, compared with 30% of people of a similar age in the general population.\nProf Ian Needleman, one of the researchers, said:  \"These are individuals who otherwise invest so much in themselves so it's a surprising finding.\n\"There are two main groups - some have a catastrophic effect, they have very serious disease that stops them in their tracks and they cannot play or train.\n\"There Il be others experiencing pain affecting sleep or sensitivity every time they take a drink. \"\nAt this level of athlete, even small differences can be quite telling.\nNutrition is one of the primary suspects with having too many sugary or acidic foods during training potentially accounting for cavities and erosion. A lot of air in the mouth during exercise can also dry it out so there is less protection.\nWhile these findings are worrying, clubs are attaching greater importance to dental health and educating their players. According to Stijin Vandenbroucke, head of medicine and sports science at West Ham United, oral health is an area where many athletes have greater problems than the general population and there are clear benefits of oral disease prevention for athletes and clubs."

Susie lost her balance in front of the teacher and dumped   the bowl of water in the boy's lap.

The one thing that stays the same with fashion is this: it always changes!\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Hippies made bell--bottomed blue jeans popular. Also, in the 1980s, Michael Jackson made parachute pants all the fashion. Now try to find these items in today's clothing stores!\nDo you know why fashions change?The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change. Over time, the new replaces the old. People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music. We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles. When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate  their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate. In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.\nClothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years. Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to make themselves different from others.\nUnfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others. Don't forget that it's always OK to develop your own sense of style that is unique and separate from what the fashion world determines! Stay true to yourself and let your personality -- not your clothes -- speak for who you are!"

      "With large and small keyboards everywhere, neither children nor adults need to write much of anything by hand. That's a big problem. Study after study suggests that handwriting is important for brain development -- helping kids get fine motor skills and learn to express and create ideas. Yet the time devoted to teaching penmanship in most schools has shrunk to just one hour a week. Is it time to give up handwriting? Have a look at the link between the brain and penmanship, and you may get the answer.\nA test among students in grades 2, 4 and 6 found that they not only wrote faster by hand than by keyboard, but also created more ideas when composing essays with handwriting. And other research shows that the finger movements required to write by hand activate brain areas involved with thought, language, and short-term memory.\nA recent Indiana University study had one group of children practice writing letters by hand while a second group just looked at those letters. Then, both groups of kids entered a functional MRI   that scanned their brains as the researchers showed them the same letters. Researchers found that the brain activity in the first group was far more advanced and \"adult-like\".\nHandwriting also affects other people's way they think of adults and children. Several studies have shown that the same average essay will score much higher if written with good penmanship and much lower if written out in poor handwriting. These studies have also found that people judge the quality of a person's ideas based on his or her handwriting. And the consequences are real: On standardized tests with handwritten sections, like the SAT, all essay that is considered hard to recognize gets a big zero.\nStudies show that this isn't only an English-language phenomenon. Chinese and Japanese youths are suffering from \"character amnesia\". They can't remember how to write characters, thanks to computers and text messaging. Some experts fear that Chinese writing and reading are so closely linked in the brain that China's reading ability as a nation could suffer."

      "Today was a big day for my eldest son, Kevin. He had his first big boy haircut. Before today, we have always stood by his side, told the hairdresser what to do and watched over the whole thing. We've been working on the rewards   of responsibility with my son for quite some time. Today, he got one of those rewards by having his own haircut.\nWhen they arrived at the shop, his father showed him a book with lots of styles of haircuts for boys. After he made his choice, he waited patiently for his turn. My husband decided he would get his own hair cut at the same time.\nWhen their names were called, Kevin showed the hairdresser the picture of his chosen haircut, which, thankfully, was not a strange haircut. The hairdresser looked to my husband for approval   and he told her his son was in charge.\nDuring his haircut, Kevin talked happily with the hairdresser. My husband, who was getting his haircut in the next chair, kept silent. When all was said and done, Kevin looked quite handsome.\nWhen it was time to pay, he reached into his pocket and took out the cash my husband gave him. He handed it to her and said, \"Thanks, it's all yours.\" I guess that's the six-year-old equivalent   of \"keep the change.\"\nI have to admit I was a little nervous about the whole thing before, but I'm a believer now.

      "People like different kinds of vacations. Some go camping. They swim, fish, cook over a fire and sleep outside. Others like to stay at a hotel in an exciting city. They go shopping all day and go dancing all night. Or maybe they go sightseeing to places such as Disneyland, the Tai Mahal or the Louvre.\nSome people are bored with sightseeing trips. They don't want to be \"tourists\". They want to have an adventure-- a surprising and exciting trip. They want to learn something and maybe help people too. How can they do this? Some travel companies and environmental groups are planning special adventures. Sometimes these trips are difficult and full of the world. Some volunteers spend two weeks and study the environment. Others work with animals. Others learn about people of the past.\nWould you like an adventure in the Far North? A team of volunteers is leaving from Murmansk, Russia. The leader of this trip is a professor from Alaska. He's worried about chemicals from factories. He and the volunteers will study this pollution in the environment. If you like exercise and cold weather, this is a good trip for you. Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day. -\nDo you enjoy ocean animals? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii. There, you can teach language to dolphins. Dolphins can follow orders such as \"Bring me the large ball\". They also understand opposites. How much more can they understand? It will be exciting to learn about these _ animals. Another study trip goes to Washington State and follows orcas. We call orcas \"Killer Whale\", but they' re really dolphins--the largest kind of dolphin.. These beautiful animals travel together in family groups. They move through the ocean with their mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. Ocean pollution is chasing their lives. Earthwatch is studying how this happens.\nAre you interested in history? Then Greece is the place for your adventure. Thirty-five hundred years ago a volcano exploded there, on Santorini. This explosion was more terrible than Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens. But today we know a lot about the way of life of the people from that time. There are houses, kitchens, and paintings as interesting as those in Pompei. Today teams of volunteers are learning more about people from the past.\nDo you want a very different vacation? Do you want to travel far, work hard and learn a lot? Then an Earthwatch vacation is for you."

      "Instead of hitting the beach, fourteen high school students traded swimming suits for lab coats last summer and turned their attention to scientific experiments.\nThe High School Research Program offers high school students guidance with researchers in Texas A&M's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Jennifer Funkhouser, academic adviser for the Department of Rangeland Ecology and Management, directs this four-week summer program designed to increase understanding of research and its career potential.\nSeveral considerations go into selecting students, including grades, school involvement and interest in science and agriculture. And many students come from poorer school districts, Funkhouser says, \"This is their chance to learn techniques and do experiments they never would have a chance to do in high school.\"\nWarner Ervin of Houston is interested in animal science and learned how to tell male from female mosquitoes .His adviser, Craig Coates, studies the genes of mosquitoes that allow them to fight against malaria and yellow fever. Coates thought this experience would be fun and helpful to the high school students.\nThe agricultural research at A&M differs from stereotypes. It's \"molecular science _ ,\" Funkhouser says. The program broadened students' knowledge. Victor Garcia of Rio Grande City hopes to become a biology teacher and says he learned a lot about chemistry from the program.\nAt the end of the program, the students presented papers on their research. They're also paid $600 for their work-another way this program differs from others, which often charge a fee.\nFourteen students got paid to learn that science is fun, that agriculture is a lot more than milking and plowing and that research can open many doors."

      "If you take it for granted that to study in university is the same as at middle school and high school, then you will be in for a surprise. \n   A change of attitude is involved in many ways when you go up to university. Although the process has been going on since you went to middle school, the biggest change is going to take place. Now, instead of taking several subjects, you have chosen one major subject because you find it interesting and worth exploring further. The choice was yours. You also have before you the goal of getting a degree. The degree, and the stages you have to pass through to achieve it, give you motivation, even though it may become weak from time to time, and not all parts of the course will be exciting; a sure way to lose interest is to do too little work. It is a law of diminishing returns---the less work you do, the less interest you will have and the more bored you will become. So regular work is needed to keep your interest as well as keep pace with new work.\n   Another change is in the relationship with those who teach you. This may well have changed during middle school and high school, but now the whole context is different. You are no longer forced to stay in school all day, and you organize your own time and place for studying. You are there to study actively rather than to be taught passively. Your teachers may or may not urge you, but they do want you to share their interest in the subject and they want you to succeed.\n   The teacher works as your coach or trainer. If you were becoming a professional tennis player or musician, you would expect your coach to look out for ways of improving your performance, and to criticize your work all the time; you would be silly to feel fed up about this---in fact you would  _ your coach if he just said everything was fine. So if you get work back with a poorer mark than you expected and with various criticisms, don't feel discouraged by this. If you don't understand what is wrong and how to improve, then ask your teacher to explain and don't be satisfied until you do understand."

      "David's Haircut\nWhen David steps out of the front door he is blinded for a moment by the white, strong sunlight and reaches for his dad's hand automatically. It's the first really warm day of the year, an unexpected heat that bridges the gap between spring and summer. Father and son are on their way to the barbershop, something they have always done together.\nAlways, the routine is the same. \"It's about time we got that mop of yours cut,\" David's dad will say, pointing at him with two fingers, a cigarette caught between them. \"Perhaps I should do it. Where are those scissors, Janet?\" Sometimes his dad runs after him round the living room, pretending to cut off his ears. When he was young, David used to get too excited and start crying, scared that maybe he really would lose his ears, but he has long since grown out of that.\nMr Samuels' barbershop is in a long room above the chip shop, reached by a steep and worn flight of stairs. David follows his father. He loves the barbershop -- it's like nowhere else he goes. It smells of cigarettes and men and hair oil. Sometimes the smell of chips will climb the stairs along with a customer and when the door opens the waiting men lift their noses together. Black and white photographs of men with various out-of-fashion hairstyles hang above a picture rail at the end of the room, where two barber's chairs are fixed to the floor. They are heavy, old-fashioned chairs with foot pumps that screams as Mr Samuels adjusts the height of the seat. In front of the chairs are deep sinks with a showerhead and long metal pipe attached to the taps, not that anyone seems to use them. Behind the sinks are mirrors and on either side of these, shelves overflowing with all types of plastic combs, shaving mugs, scissors, cut throat razors, hair brushes and, 10 bright red bottles of Brylcreem , piled neatly in a pyramid. At the back of the room sit the customers, silent for most of the time, except when Mr Samuels breaks off from cutting and smoke his cigarette, sending a stream of grey-blue smoke like the tail of kite twisting into the air.\nWhen it is David's turn for a cut, Mr Samuels places a wooden board covered with a piece of red leather across the arms of the chair, so that the barber doesn't have to bend to cut the boy's hair. David scrambles up onto the bench.\n\"Hey, young man, you're shooting up, you won't need this soon, you'll be able to sit in the chair,\" the barber says.\n\"Wow,\" says David, turning round to look at his dad, forgetting that he can see him through the mirror. \"Dad, Mr Samuels said I could be sitting in the chair soon, not just on the board!\"\n\"So I hear,\" his father replies, not looking up from the paper. _ \n\"At least double the price,\" said Mr Samuels, winking at David.\nFinally David's dad looks up from his newspaper and glances into the mirror, seeing his son looking back at him. He smiles.\n\"Wasn't so long ago when I had to lift you onto that board because you couldn't climb up there yourself,\" he says.\n\"They don't stay young for long do they, kids\", Mr Samuels declares. All the men in the shop nod in agreement. David nods too.\nIn the mirror he sees a little head sticking out of a long nylon cape. Occasionally he steals glances at the barber as he works. He smells a mixture of smelly sweat and aftershave as the barber moves around him, combing and cutting, combing and cutting.\nDavid feels like he is in another world, noiseless except for the sound of the barber's shoes rubbing on the plastic carpet and the click of his scissors. In the reflection from the window he could see through the window, a few small clouds moved slowly through the frame, moving to the sound of the scissors' click.\nSleepily, his eyes dropping to the front of the cape where his hair falls softly as snow and he imagines sitting in the chair just like the men and older boys, the special bench left leaning against the wall in the corner. He thinks about the picture book of Bible stories his aunt gave him for Christmas, the one of Samson having his hair cut by Delilah. David wonders if his strength will go like Samson's.\nWhen Mr Samuels has finished, David hops down from the seat, rubbing the itchy hair from his face. Looking down he sees his own thick, blonde hair mixed among the browns, greys and blacks of the men who have sat in the chair before him. _ \nThey reach the pavement outside the shop. \"I tell you what, boy, let's get some fish and chips to take home, save your mum from cooking tea,\" says David's dad and turns up the street.\nThe youngster is excited and catches his dad's hand. The thick-skinned fingers close gently around his and David is surprised to find, warming in his father's palm, a handful of his own hair."

      "The movies just wouldn't be the same without the warm buttery taste of popcorn. Amazingly, this delicious treat started its life as a corn kernel   , not just from any corn. Popcorn is a type of sweet corn that was originally grown in Mexico and spread to China, India and elsewhere. It is the only kind of corn that will pop. Today, most of the world's popcorn is grown in the United States.\nEvery popcorn kernel contains a tiny drop of water,surrounded by soft starch  .  When the popcorn is heated, the water turns into steam. This puts pressure on the surrounding hard kernel, forcing it to explode. The soft starch increases about 40 times in size as the corn kernel turns itself inside out.\nIn the 1500s popcorn was an important food source for the Aztec Indians of central and southern Mexico.  But it wasn't only food. It was also used in ceremonies or on red dresses and in necklaces. By the time the Europeans arrived in America,popcorn had spread through most of the American Indians.\nSome early American settlers ate popcorn with cream and sugar for breakfast. But it wasn't until the late 1800s that popcorn became popular. The demand for popcorn increased and farmers began farming popcorn. The first mobile popping machine was invented in 1885, and popcorn was sold by street sellers much like hot dogs that are sold today.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the popcorn business still _ as people could still afford it. Then in the 1950s television arrived and popcorn consumption decreased. People stayed home and stopped going to the theatre. But the link between movies and popcorn had already existed.  Soon people began making popcorn at home on the stove and, later,microwave popcorn was introduced. Today the movies have regained popularity and popcorn has once again become the favorite."

      "Fans of US television dramas watch their favorite series for different reasons: some want to improve their English skills, others just want to kill time.www.ks5u.com\nSome TV series are more than pure entertainment--they have a certain depth. Mad Men, which returned with a sixth season recently; Monday Mornings, which just finished its first season; and Modern Family, which sweeps the awards every year, are just a few examples.\nWhy do these shows stand out among so many similar ones? TV critics Raymond Zhou will give you an idea of why some shows are better than others.\nPeriod drama--More than time travel\n    Period dramas are intended to capture the ambience   of a particular era. Directors must therefore attract audiences as much by their recreation of a historical setting as by an interesting storyline.www.ks5u.com\n    Mad Men is an excellent example of this balance being struck. Set in New York during the 1960s, it accurately shows US attitudes in the workplace through the alcoholism and chain-smoking common of the time, and places an absorbing plot right in its center.\n    But rather than merely presenting a past decade, Mad Men's subtle   description of the struggles of white-collar workers at the time, both male and female, makes it stand out.\n    \"The series' attention to detail is superb,\" Raymond Zhou said. \"For example, creator Matthew Weiner makes Don Draper--the leading role of the series--drive a Buick instead of a Cadillac, because Weiner thinks the ad man lacks the self-pride to buy a luxury car. It's this kind of attentiveness that raises the show's artistic value.\"\nCritics also recommend\n    Another period drama that works is Broadwalk Empire, set during the prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n    Heather Havrilesky at Salon magazine noted how the show \"revels in the oddities  of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a shadow world of criminals and politicians working together to keep the liquor flowing.\"www.ks5u.com\n                 Why does it appeal to viewers? Because they know that the \"liquor\" is a metaphor   for today's political scandals  .www.ks5u.com"

      "Publishing on paper will draw up to an end in the next 30 years. That's what some high-tech experts have said ever since computers began appearing in everyone's workplace. If you have ever read a newspaper online, you have experienced a tiny part of what paperless future look like.\n       New technology will certainly continue to revolutionize written communication. But will the use of paper in our everyday lives really disappear anytime soon? Well, don't give up on paper just yet.\n       Paper, an ancient Chinese invention, has dominated  written communication for centuries. Cai Lun, an official in the prefix = st1 /Chinese Imperial Court, is well-known for inventing paper in A.D. 105. This invention changed the world forever.\n       Today, surprisingly, it seems the digital age has actually strengthened the importance of paper. Studies show that paper use has doubled in the last 20 years. People still like to print their longer documents and e-mails. But today's technology is rapidly improving. And efforts toward a paperless world continue.\n       The Internet is clearly one giant step. Many of the publications have created Web sites that offer everything in their paper editions--and even more. Their Web sites can be continually updated as news happens. Other types of material have also fit well into the digital age. Dictionaries and other reference books actually work better in a paperless format. Information published on a Web site or CD-ROM can be kept more current.\n       In addition publishers have begun to produce e-book version of their best sellers. New e-book readers---a simple computer about the size of a paperback book--can store nearly a hundred books. But e-books haven't gained a large following.Readingfrom a computer is simply uncomfortable and paperback books are easier to carry around."

      "Do you suffer from perfectionism ?\nAccording to psychologist and perfectionism researcher, Hamaehek D.E.there are two types of perfectionism: normal and neurotic  .A person with normal or healthy perfectionism feels a deep sense of pleasure from the dull effort of working towards \"perfect\". And then there are the neurotic or unhealthy perfectionists who never feel satisfied but keep struggling towards impossible goals.These people often measure their own self-worth entirely in terms of productivity and accomplishment.\nIt is necessary to notice if you are struggling and feel tense while trying to perfect your recipe, article, parenting, job, project, etc.You are fighting and resisting your own humanness.\nHow do you know if you suffer from perfectionism?\n* Are you afraid of making mistakes?\n* Do you get impatient with others when they make a mistake?\n* If you fail an assignment at work or school, do you feel like a failure?\n* How do you feel when you read these questions?\nYour relationship with yourself is the foundation for all of your other relationships.If you are hard on yourself, then you'll in turn be hard on others.If we are unable to care for our innermost beings, then our lives will reflect this fault in some way.Embracing  your own humanness is the doorway to seeing the miracles of who you are at your best.\nDr. Bemie Siegcl writes in his new book on miracles, \"Our body loves us, but it needs to know we love our lives in order for it to do all it can to help us survive.The change in body energy motivated by the love leads to chemical changes in our body and makes a difference.\nIn many cases, this kind of miracle needs hard work.But when you are willing to do the work, and live in your heart, it can happen.\""

      "Located in the northeast part of the Jiayi County in Taiwan Province, Ali Mountain is in fact the general name of the 18 hills including Zhu Hill and Tower Hill. The highest peak of Ali Mountain is Tower Hill with the height of 2,663 meters (about 8,736 feet). Ali Mountain is world famous for its \"five rare sites\" including the Sunrise, the Ali Mountain Forest Railway, the famous Alishan Sacred Tree, the Grand Sea of Clouds, and the Flamboyant Cherry Blossom. It is said that one who has not been to Ali Mountain will never know its wonderful beauty. \nThe sunrise is a must for everyone who travels the Ali Mountain. Many have said, \"To miss viewing the sunrise on Ali Mountain is like returning empty after entering the Golconda, a source of great wealth.\" The best place to view the sunrise is on the top of Zhu Hill. The place and time of the sunrise are different due to the changes of the four seasons. If you plan to view the sunrise, it is best to ask the local people the time of sunrise, so you don't miss this magnificent opportunity. \nThe Ali Mountain Forest Railway is regarded as one of three mountain climbing railways. Traveling along the 72-kilometer-long railway, the train climbs from 30 meters (about 98 feet) to 2,450 meters (about 8,038 feet) above sea level. Its gradient is so great that it is rarely seen in the whole world. From the bottom of Ali Mountain to the top, the train crosses four forest areas--tropical, subtropical, temperate and frigid zones. \nThere is a Chinese juniper   within the Ali Mountain forest area, with some 53 meters (about 174 feet) high, and 23 meters (about 75 feet) wide. This juniper is so huge that more than ten people can surround it. It has a history of more than 3,000 years, thus is called Alishan Sacred Tree. The most wondrous tree is a \"three-generation\" tree. The three generations of this tree exist in the same trunk. While the first and second generations have faded, the third generation is still flourishing. This tree is really a wonder of nature.\nThe sea of clouds and the cherry blossom should not be overlooked. If you want to avoid sunstroke, the comfortable climate in mid-summer on Ali Mountain will be a good choice."

      "_ A poor attitude gets more people fired than any other single factor, and a good attitude gets people jobs and helps them keep those jobs more than any other factor.\nYour attitude affects many people, from your family to the stranger on the street corner. Your attitude is particularly important when you face seemingly hopeless situations. Losing a job or a friend because of a poor attitude is unfortunate--especially because a bad attitude can be fixed.\nYou can find at least two ways to look at everything. A pessimist looks for difficulty in the opportunity, while an optimist looks for opportunity in the difficulty. A poet of long ago put the difference between optimism and pessimism  this way: two men looked out of the prison bars--one saw mud while the other saw stars.\nUnfortunately, many people look only at the problem and not at the opportunity that lies within the problem. Many employees complain about the difficulty of their jobs, for example, not realizing that if the job was simple, the employer would hire someone with less ability at a lower wage. A small coin can hide even the sun if you hold the coin close enough to your eye. So when you get too close to your problems, to think objectively  about them, try to keep in mind how your vision can be _ . Take a step back, and look at the situation from a new angle.\nYou can't do anything to change the fact that a problem exists, but you can do a great deal to find the opportunity within that problem. You're guaranteed a better tomorrow by doing your best today and developing a plan of action for the tomorrows that lie ahead. Just remember to maintain a positive mental attitude."

      "Most people I meet want to develop more harmonious and satisfying relationships. But we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. When we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . Curiosity and good listening bring us back together.\nAs I consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, I'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together. There is no need for us to be joined at the head. We are already joined by our hearts."

      "Singapore was just a sleepy city in Southeast Asia more than 50 years ago. But the small dot on the world map has since developed into one of the richest nations thanks to its founder and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the state, who passed away on March 23, 2015 at the age of 91.\nLee grew up in a Singapore that was part of the British Empire. As a law major who graduated from Cambridge University and the founder of the People's Action Party, he became Singapore's first prime minister in 1959 when British agreed to the island's self-rule.\nLee was a leader with vision . He knew that without agriculture and natural resources, Singapore could only find a way out by developing itself into a place perfect for business. So he began with a few simple ideas: Singapore needed respect for elders and the law, hard work, and the idea that the needs of society are greater than the individual's. He united Chinese, Indians and Malays, making English a common language. He fought corruption and even banned chewing gum. That helped change Singapore from a poor city in the 1950s to a world business center with a GDP per-capita of $ 55,000, reported the Financial Times.\nLee left the office of prime minister in 1990 but remained a member of parliament. He resigned as \"Minister Mentor\" in 2011. He was happy with his work: \"I have no regrets. I have spent my life, so much of it, building up this country. There's nothing more that I need to do.\"\nTo the world, Lee was one of Asia's most popular politicians. He was one of the first to spot the potential of China under a former leader Deng Xiaoping and contributed to China's reform and opening up. \"No small number of this and past generations of world leaders have asked for his advice on governances and development,\" said US President Obama. \"Lee is a visionary and a true giant of history.\""

He never lost his baby teeth, never grew taller than about 30 inches and never weighed more than 28 pounds. They did estimate, however, that he would not live to see his 12th birthday.\nAs a boy I learned to feed and clothe Mike. As a teenager, I babysat for my \"big brother\" and learned use the proper medicine to prevent the seizures  that caused him to tremble.\nMany people said he would never walk or talk . He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk  --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too. I was Kagun, not Kevin. But that changed with a beard I grew during the summer before college. Family members said it was ugly. Mike heard it.\n\"Look who's at home. Who's that?\" they'd say to Mike. \"Ugly,\" he would respond with delight.\nAll of which--to me--was normal, for he was the only brother I knew. The only time I thought of the differences between us was when others pointed them out. \nMy circle of friends widened when I entered high school. One day Mom asked if my new friends would have a problem seeing Mike for the first time. \"If they don't accept Mike, they don't accept me and they aren't welcome,\" I said.\nAnd if I didn't think of him as different, I never thought about him dying either. On a warm fall night in 1998, Mike had a seizure. With this first seizure, Mike's life was beginning to fade. \nOn March 15, 1999, Mike died. Michael Patrick Harter--just 26 years old-- died in Mom's arms. \nWe never had those great talks other brothers have about women, work and parents. We never played catch or talked about our dreams. But Mike taught me compassion and strength. He taught me respect for those less fortunate than myself. And he taught me an appreciation of the beauty in the simplest things.\nPhysically and mentally, I was my brother's keeper. Spiritually, Mike was and is my keeper--a nearly silent guardian angel."

      "Scientists from South Korea are trying to convert sound waves into electricity. The research could lead to charging a cell phone from a conversation or providing energy to the nation's electricity system generated by the noise during rash-hour traffic.\n\"Just as speakers transform electrical signals into sound, the opposite process --turning sound into a source of electrical power -- is possible,\" said Young Jun Park and Sang-Woo Kim, the joint authors of a new article in the journal Advanced Materials.\nHarvesting energy from phone calls and passing cars is based on materials known as piezoelectrics. When bent, piezoelectric materials turn that mechanical energy into electricity. Lots of materials are piezoelectric: cane sugar, quartz  and even dried bone which could create an electrical charge when stressed. For decades, scientists have pumped electricity into piezoelectric materials for use in environmental sensors, speakers and other devices.\nOver the past few years, however, scientists have made dramatic advances in getting electricity out of piezoelectric devices. In an experiment, by using sound waves, which at 100 decibels were not quite as loud as a rock concert (a normal conversation is about 60-70 decibels), the South Korean scientists produced a mild electrical current of about 50 millivolts . The average cell phone requires a few volts to function, several times the power this technology can currently produce.\n\"But the real question is whether there is enough surrounding noise to act as a power source as for a cell phone,\" said McAlpine, a leading scientist. A consumer probably wouldn't want to attend a rock concert or stand next to a passing train to charge his cell phone. The South Korean scientists agree but they expect to get a higher power output as they continue their work."

Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing , eat a special kind of cereal , or see a movie . Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisement for it . For example , you probably do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket . There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves . You may not have space on your shelf for another . But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extratasty and has a free prize in the box , you may want it . Advertising must get attention . To be effective , it must be exciting , entertaining , or provide pleasure . The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product .

      "Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.\nThe first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.\nIn the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.\nThe researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.\nWhile scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay."

She swiped   her bus-card, only to find the machine would not accept it. The driver told her to pay the $2.25 fare. \"I just bought this card,\" she said. \"I paid the money...\"\nThe driver said she could take the card back to the sales office and explain the problem.

      "Tourism has the power to bring jobs and economic development to popular destination , but how should travelers decide where to spend their money? Are some countries more deserving of visitors' dollars than others?\nThat's the idea behind the 10-destination list put together by San Francisco-based non-profit Ethical Traveler, which since 2006,has published an annual guide to the World's Best Ethical Destinations in the developing world.\n\"Instead of publishing countries for doing bad things,\" said Jeff Greenwald, executive director of Ethical Traveler, \"we're trying to offer a favor, rewarding countries in the developing world that are really trying to do the right thing.\"\nSo which countries are the most ethical? For 2013,the winners are Barbados, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia ,Lithuania, Mauritius, Palau, Samoa and Uruguay.\nThose 10 countries scored highest in three main areas: social welfare, environmental protection and human rights.\nGreenwald explained that countries must have a good tourism infrastructure to make the list, but the non-profit Ethical Traveler also uses the list to promote some under-visited places that can be a role model for other countries in their region. For example, Latvia earned high marks for improving its environmental efforts and strong human rights record, and the country's parks and nature reserves make for a great off-the-beaten-path ecotourism trip.\nIn addition to just visiting these countries, travelers should aim to spend their money in locally-owned business, Greenwald said, to ensure their financial support stays in the country they're visiting. However, that requires a well-maneged tourism infrastructure. While one could argue those poor places need the money even more, tourism can put pressure on countries that face such challenges.\nErica Avrami, research and education director at the World Monuments Fund(WMF) said that a list of ethical destinations is \"a wonderful idea\", the idea of being ethical goes both ways. \"There's also a certain responsibility on the part of the traveler to make sure their own footprint is as minimal as possible,\" she said."

      "Poverty is not first thing that comes to mind when you think of Japan. After all, there are no children begging on the streets in major cities here. You do not often see Japanese citizens publicly letting out their complaints over the country's economic decline. But senior government researcher Aya Abe says Japan has the fourth highest rate of child poverty among developed countries.\nShe says she sees that poverty in schools where students admit to only bathing once a week. Some cannot afford to buy pencils for class.\n\"They may not be on the streets begging or they may not be turning into criminals, but it's there. It's just that we have to open our eyes and see,\" Abe said.\nAbe owes the increase in child poverty to the country's changing demographics , struggling economy and high social security premiums . She says fewer people live in three-generation households, where the parents and grandparents work. The number of single mothers has increased. The salary for young fathers has declined with the economic downturn. Social security premiums have increased in the last 20 years, putting families on the edge of poverty.\nAbe says studies conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD ) point to rising poverty in Japan before the global economic crises in 2008. But the Japanese government and the public refused to acknowledge it until then partly because of the shame associated with poverty.\n\"It was very unpopular for Japanese media to say anything about Japanese poverty,\" said Abe. \"Even though OECD Japan announced it in Japanese, Japanese media didn't make it into the articles.\"\nAbe says new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has taken one important step to help alleviate   the problem. Next year, his Democratic Party of Japan plans to double monthly child care allowances given to families.\nBut Abe wants the government to expand its financial help even more. She wants it to simplify the process to apply for public assistance and provide educational grants for students struggling to pay for tuition at high schools and colleges. The country now only offers loans.\nAbe also says the government must act quickly because she says the problem will only get worse in the next few years."

      "Four out of ten parents in the UK spend between PS100 and PS500 on their children's birthday parties, according to a survey. Four in ten parents of children under 18, who were questioned in a survey, admitted that they felt pressured into organizing more expensive birthday parties for their children than they would like to.\nHow much parents spend on their children's birthday parties is one of the most frequently discussed topics on parenting websites. Here is one comment on Mumsnet summing up the thoughts of many parents: \"Where we live everyone hires places, entertainers and so on. I don't want to compare with my rich neighbors, but I want my son to have what all his classmates have.\"\nThe research was carried out on behalf of the children's charity, Lumos, set up by the author JK Rowling. Just 13 percent of parents spent PS50 or less in the past year on their children's parties.\nMany children's clowns  or entertainers charge PS150 or more for an hour, and parents often feel it necessary to book a special place. Even without these, the cost of plates, the cake and party bags can _ . Party Pieces, a company set up by Carole and Michael Middleton, charge about PS16 for a birthday cake for a party with 16 guests, PS22 for table decorations and up to PS48 for party bags.\nMany children of famous people have increasingly expensive parties, often seen in famous magazines. Suri Cruise, the daughter of actor Tom Cruise and actress Katie Holmes, enjoyed a PS100,000 birthday party according to a report.\nGeorgette Mulheir of Lumos, said,\"Parents in the UK are under increasing pressure to spend more and more money on birthday parties for their children and their children's friends.\""

      "Whether in the home or the workplace, social robots are going to become a lot more common in the next few years. Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.\nWhile household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market. The company's \"Oshbot\" robot is built to assist customers in a store, which can help the customers find items and help guide them to the product's location in the store. It can also speak different languages and make recommendations for different items based on what the customer is shopping for.\nThe more interaction the robot has with humans, the more it learns. But Oshbot, like other social robots, is not intended to replace workers, but to work alongside other employees. \"We have technologies to train social robots to do things not for us, but with us,\" said Breazeal."

      "On the high-speed train Avignon to Paris, my husband and I landed in the only remaining seats on the train, in the middle of a car, directly opposite a Frenchwoman of middle years. It was an extremely uncomfortable arrangement to be looking straight into the eyes of a stranger. My husband and I pulled out books. The woman produced a large makeup case and made up her face. Except for a lunch break, she continued this activity for the entire three-hour trip. Every once in a while she surveyed the car with a bright-eyed glance, but never once did she catch my eye. _ .\nI was amused, but some people would have felt uncomfortable , even repulsed .there is something about making up in public that calls up strong emotional reactions. Partly it's a question of hygiene. And it's a matter of degree. Making up --- a private act--- has a way of neglecting the presence of others. I was once seated at a party with a model-actress who immediately waved a silly brush and began dusting her face at the table, demonstrating that while she was next to me, she was not with me.\nIn fact, I am generally prohibited from making up in public, except when I am in the company of cosmetics moment. In a gathering more professional than social, I would do so.\nKathy Peiss, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst says that nose-powdering in the office was an occasion for outrage in 1920's and 30's. Deploring the practice as a waste of company time, trade journals advises managers to discourage it among workers. Peiss theorizes that it was female's making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.\nPeiss tells me that after the 30's , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be \"a gesture of inappropriate feminity .\" One guess is that most professional women feel this way. There is evidence of the popularity of the new lipsticks that remain in place all day without retouching."

      "I must have been about fourteen then, and I put away the incident from my mind with the easy carelessness of youth. But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me years later, and ever since have been of great value to me.\nCarl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I was doing. I said three or four hours a day.\n\"Do you practice in long _ , an hour at a time?\"\n\"I try to.\"\n\"Well, don't, \" he said loudly. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches. Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\"\nWhen I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript  ready for revision. Later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal  method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were moments which could be caught and put to use.\nThere is an important trick in this time-using principle: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste it in chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.\nI admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a significant influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I throw myself into it without delay."

      "This past Christmas season, I went to visit my parents. During the visit, I found the letters  written by my parents to each other during the war in the attic . The letters were piles high,dirty and had not been touched for decades. I asked Mother and Father if I could take the lettersback to my home. They agreed.As I opened each letter, all of them delicate with age, I discovered a new page in this private part of my parents' lives. My father served in the army. His letters were full of frontline  descriptions, and they continued all the way through the battle. Each of my mother's letters was  sealed with a lipstick kiss. Father wrote that he sealed his return letters by rekissing her lipstick  kiss. How they had been missing each other! I finished reading six months of the letters and  discovered there were at least eleven months missing. Maybe they were lost forever.\nNot long after our Christmas visit, Father became very ill and was in hospital. I went to the hospital to see him. As I sat by his bedside, he told me how much receiving those lipstick-kissed letters had meant to him when he had been so far from home.\nLater that evening, Mother and I revisited the attic in search of the lost letters. Finally we dug them out of Mother's old college trunk. The next day was Valentine's Day, and we went to the hospital. At my father's bedside, I showed him an old envelope. His curiosity was aroused.\nWhen he carefully opened the letter, he recognized it and his eyes were filled with tears. He read the love messages that had been delivered years before to my mother in a quavery  voice.\nThis Valentine's Day, we were lucky that we had everything."

      "Homeopathy is the oldest form of complementary and alternative medicines from Europe. It originated with the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755--1843). He came across the cinchona, the bark of a South American tree that was used by the local people to treat fevers. Among the active ingredients in the bark is quinine , which is still used to treat malaria. If a healthy person took cinchona, he or she would have symptoms   of malaria. In 1796 and 1810, Hahnemann published essays on the theories of homeopathy: substances that cause illnesses or symptoms in people can be used in small doses as treatment. Supporters of homeopathy viewed it as a safe, patient-centered system. Hahnemann claimed he could cure any and all illnesses using homeopathic principles.\nHowever, the Australian council sought to evaluate this claim once and for all. Their assessment was based on the analysis of 57 published systematic reviews encompassing 176 individual studies, independent evaluation of evidence provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public, and clinical practice guidelines and reports on homeopathy from other governments. Studies were only considered if they were case-controlled, meaning they compared a group of patients receiving homeopathic treatments with a control group. The council who oversaw this review consisted of experts in conventional-based medicine as well as complementary and alternative medicines. As a guideline, for a treatment to be considered effective, it must result in health improvements that cannot be explained by the placebo   effect, these improvements must be meaningful for a person's overall health and the results have to be seen consistently in several studies. A draft of the report was reviewed by a group of independent experts in complementary medicine research and opened up for public consultation before it was finalized.\nEventually, the council found no reliable evidence that homeopathic treatments were effective. Studies that did find homeopathy to be effective were overall of poor scientific quality, used too few patients or lacked evidence on which to base their conclusions. Rejecting proven medical treatments in favor of homeopathy for chronic or potentially serious conditions could place people at risk. As always, use of homeopathic or other remedies should be discussed with your physician in order to make informed healthcare decisions."

      "Dear Editor, \nBrockingham is run by people who are more interested in tourists than its residents. The problem is that the people running the government refuse to accept new ideas. By banning all fast-food restaurants and discount stores, they take away all the places kids can afford to shop.\nThese people forget that when they were young, they could go to the South Street Soda Fountain and get an ice-cream soda for 25 cents. Today you can't find an ice-cream soda anywhere in Brockingham for less than $2! Where can kids go for a snack?\nThere is not a single restaurant in Brockingham where a family of four can eat dinner for less than $100. Add a 15% tip and sales tax and you have spent nearly $125 to eat a meal you could prepare at home for about $12. Have you noticed that Brockingham families never dine in Brockingham?\nFast-food restaurants are also a good place for school kids to get an after-school job. Fast-food restaurants are busiest during the early supper hours when students are able to work, whereas the fancy food restaurants cater to late-night diners. Working in one of these establishments requires working shifts that are too late for most students.\nThe City Council claims that local merchants, rather than national chains, should benefit from the tourist business. I agree that it is important to support local businesses, but I think the fast-food restaurants would encourage more people to shop in Brockingham.\nAnother thing that disturbs me is that we must travel 25 miles to the nearest discount store. If I need a tire for my bike, I have a choice of buying one at Surf and Peddle Sport Shop for $15 or driving to Parkersburg Discount Center where I can buy the same kind of tire for $9. Again, I think the ban on all food chains and discount houses is  _ for our city.\nWes Woodrow\n9th-Grade Student at Brockingham High School"

      "What do Tom Sawyer and Jumping Frogs have in common? Stories about both of them were created by one man: Mark Twain. Twain was four years old when his family moved to Hannibal, Missouri, located on the west bank of the Mississippi. Twain grew up there and was fascinated with (......) life along the river----the steamboats, the giant lumber rafts, and the people who worked on them.\nThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County is one of Twain's best loved short stories, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of his most famous novels. Both these works are celebrated by events held during National Tom Sawyer Days, which originated in the late 1950s and became national in the 1960s. Children enter their frogs in the jumping contest during National Tom Sawyer Days. There's also a fence painting contest to see who can paint the fastest. The idea for this contest comes from a scene in Tom Sawyer, in which Tom has been told to paint the fence in front of the house he lives in. It's a beautiful day, and he would rather be doing anything else. As his friends walk by, he makes them believe that it's fun to paint, and they join in the \"fun\". By the end of the day, the fence has three coats of paint!\nAlthough the story of Tom Sawyer is a fiction, it's based on facts. If you go to Hannibal, you'll see the white fence, which still stands at Twain's boyhood home."

      "Wugging, or web-use giving, describes the act of giving to charity at no cost to the user. By using Everyclick.com, which is being added to a number of university computers across the UK, students can raise money every time they search, but it won't cost them a penny.\nResearch shows that students are extremely passionate about supporting charity -- 88% of full time students have used the Internet to give to charity. This figure is high considering this age group is often the least likely to have their own income. 19% of 22 to 24 year olds have short-term debts of more than PS5,000. With rising personal debt levels in this age group, due to university tuition fees or personal loans and a lack of long-term savings, traditional methods of donating to charity are often not appealing or possible.\nBeth Truman, a 21 year old recent university graduate, has used everyclick.com to donate to her chosen charity, the RSPCA, for two years and has seen the \"wugging\" grow in popularity with students. \"When you're at university you become more socially aware, but it's sometimes hard to give to others when you have little money yourself,\" says Beth. \"Wugging is great for people in this age group as it allows them to use the technology on a daily basis to give to charity, without costing them a single penny.\"\nWugging is perfect for people who want to be more socially aware and supportive but don't feel they have the means to do so. Students using the web can raise money for causes they care about without costing them anything in terms of time or money, and charities get a valuable source of funding.\nEveryclick.com works like any other search engine, allowing users to search for information, news and images but users can decide which of the UK's 170,000 charities they would like to support through their clicks. Everyclick.com then makes monthly payments to every registered charity. Launched in June 2005, Everyclick.com is now the eighth largest search engine and one of the busiest charity websites in the UK."

      "It is common to consider learning as something that takes place in school, but much of human learning occurs outside the classroom, even from birth and people continue to learn throughout their lives.\nEven before they enter school, young children learn to walk, to talk, and to use their hands to use toys, food, and other objects. They use all of their senses to learn about the sights,sounds,tastes, and smells in their environments. They learn how to communicate with their parents, grandparents,\nfriends, and other people important to their world. When they enter school, children learn basic academic subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics, They also continue to learn a great deal outside the classroom. They learn which behaviors are likely to be rewarded and which are likely to be punished. They learn social skills for communicating with other children. After they finish school, people must learn to deal with the many major changes that affect their lives, such as getting married, raising children, and finding and keeping a job.\nBecause learning continues throughout our lives and affects almost everything we do, the study of learning is important in many different fields. Teachers need to understand the best ways to educate children. Psychologists, social workers, criminologists, and other human-service workers need to understand how certain experiences change people's behaviors. Employers, politicians, and advertisers make use of the principles of learning to affect the behavior of workers, voters, and consumers.\nLearning is closely related to memory, which is the storage of information in the brain. Psychologists who study memory are interested in how the brain stores knowledge, where this storage takes place and how the brain later outputs knowledge when we need it. In contrast, psychologists who study learning are more interested in behavior and how behavior changes as a result of a person's experiences."

      "The next morning Alex was waiting in the FMA president's suite when Jerome Patterton arrived. Alex filled him in quickly on the Jax report. Then he said, \"I want you to give an order to the trust department to sell every share of Supranational we're holding.\"\n\"I won't!\" Patterton's voice rose. \"Who do you think you are, giving orders-----\" \"I'll tell you who I am, Jerome. I'm the guy who warned the board against in-depth involvement with SuNatCo. I fought against heavy trust department buying of the stock, but no one-----including you -----would listen. Now Supranational is caving in.\" Alex leaned across the desk and slammed a fist down hard. \"Don't you understand? Supranational can bring this bank down with it.\"\nPatterton was shaken. \"But is SuNatCo in real trouble? Are you sure?\"\n\"If I weren't, do you think I'd be here? I'm giving you a chance to salvage something at least.\" He pointed to his wristwatch. \"It's an hour since the New York  stock market opened. Jerome, get on the phone and give that order!\"\nMuscles around the bank president's mouth twitched nervously. Never decisive, strong influence often swayed him. He hesitated, then picked up the telephone.\n\"Get me Mitchell in the trust department... Mitch? This is Jerome. Listen carefully. I want you to give a sell order immediately on all the Supranational stock we hold... Yes, sell every share.\" Patterton listened, then said impatiently, \"Yes, I know what it'll do to the market. And I know it's irregular.\" His eyes sought Alex's for reassurance. The hand holding the telephone trembled as he said, \"There's no time to hold meetings. So do it! Yes, I accept responsibility.\"\nHe hung up and reached for a glass of water. \"The stock is already down. Our selling will depress it more. We'll be taking a big beating.\"\n\"It's our clients-----people who trusted us-----who will take the beating. And they'd have taken a bigger one still, if we'd waited. Even now we're not out of the woods. A week from now the SEC may disallow those sales. They may rule we had inside knowledge that Supranational was about to be bankrupt, which we should have reported and which would have halted trading in the stock."

      "Australia has passed regulations that will enable more international students to further their education in the country.\nThe new measures were released by the Australian Department of Tertiary Education,Skills,Jobs and Workplace Relations in September and will take effect in mid-2012.\nAs a result,the student visa application process for overseas students has been simplified,and the deposit   required to study in Australia has been reduced.Language requirements for overseas students have also been eased.\nAlso,overseas students receiving a higher education in Australia will be granted a working visa lasting from two to four years after graduation,as long as they meet the basic IELTS requirement.\n\"This change will definitely make Australia a more attractive destination for Chinese students planning to study overseas,\" says Wang Lan,a consultant from Education International Cooperation Group (EIC),a Beijing-based company that provides services to students wishing to study overseas.\nHowever,in the past few years,many of Wang's student clients   could not start studies in Australia because they did not meet the language requirements,visa processing took a long time and deposit regulations were tough.The change in policy is good news for the parents of students wishing to study in Australia,Wang says.\nA 22-year-old female student surnamed Li,in Beijing,who is planning to do her postgraduate studies in Australia,learned about the policy change several weeks ago.\n\"According to the previous deposit requirement for my student visa,my family was required to put down 550,000 yuan ($86,850).Now we only need to prepare 410,000 yuan.This is a relief for my parents,\" Li says.\nShe also says that the two to four years working visa makes her feel much clearer about her study plans.\n\"I believe several years of working experience abroad will strengthen my competitiveness when I return to China,\" she says.\nGaining a competitive advantage is the major reason for Chinese students to study abroad,according to the report by EIC."

      "Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan sees an epidemic   sweeping across America's farmland. It has little to do with the usual challenges, such as flood, rising fuel prices and crop-eating insects. The country's farmers are getting older, and there are fewer people standing in line to take their place. National agricultural census   figures show that the fastest-growing group of farmers is the part over 65. Merrigan is afraid the average age will be even higher when the 2012 statistics are completed.\nMerrigan, a former college professor, is making stops at universities across the country in hopes of encouraging more students to think about careers in agriculture. Aside from trying to stop the graying of America's farmers, her work is made tougher by a recent blog posting that put agriculture at No. 1 on a list of \"useless\" college degrees. Top federal agriculture officials are talking about the posting, and it has the attention of agricultural organizations across the country.\n\"There couldn't be anything that's more incorrect,\" Merrigan said. \"We know that there aren't enough qualified graduates to fill the jobs that are out there in American agriculture.\"\nIn addition, a growing world population that some experts predict will require 70% more food production by 2050, she said.\n\"I truly believe we're at a golden age of agriculture. Global demand is at an all-time record high, and global supplies are at all-time record lows,\" said Matt Rush, director of the Texas Farm Bureau. \"Production costs are going to be valuable enough that younger people are going to have the opportunity to be involved in agriculture. \"\nThe Department of Agriculture has programs aimed at developing more farmers and at increasing interest in locally grown food. The National Young Farmers' Coalition has also been pushing for state and federal policy changes to make it easier for new farmers.\nRyan Best, president of Future Farmers of America, has been living out of a suitcase, traveling the country and visiting with high school students about careers in agriculture. The 21-year-old Best hopes his message --that this is a new time in agriculture-- will motivate the next generation\n. \"Never before have we had the innovations   in technology which have led to agriculture in this country being the most efficient it has ever been,\" he said. \"There's really a place for everybody to fit in. \""

      "Hot words on the Internet don't stay hot for long. \"Geili\" and \"fuyun\", last year's biggest linguistic innovations, are practically prehistoric in Internet terms. What's buzzing now is \"hold steady\"\nThe term comes from a segment   on the Taiwanese TV show\nwhich features Miss Lin(Xie Yilin) giving a lecture on how to behave like a fashion queen at parties or on the bus. The extremely funny lecture is mainly an over-the-top mockery  of the fashion world, but Miss Lin makes a point: We need to hold steady in pressure-filled or embarrassing situations.\nHolding steady, Internet slang for \"staying poised\", is one of the qualities the public has been looking for lately as pressures on marriage, work and money can easily drive people crazy. The quality was demonstrated by a girl named Su Miaoling this year. The contestant in the TV singing competition\ncarried herself with an air of confidence on stage and kept her cool when others got anxious. \"I like your poise . Very few contestants on this stage can keep calm like you do,\" said one of the show's judges, Hu Haiquan, to Su. Internet users dubbed Su \"Sister Poise\".\nPoise is also appreciated in Western culture as an essential quality of a well-mannered person. Each year, the National League of Junior Cotillions of the US releases a list of the Ten Best Mannered People. Kate Middleton made it onto the list in 2011 \"for the poise and dignity with which she conducts herself in the public spotlight\". The Duchess of Cambridge was also acclaimed earlier this year for her remarkable poise at the royal wedding.\nGood news for many, poise is not genetic----it can be acquired with a bit of effort. A personal growth guidance gives tips on how to stay poised. \"Take a few deep breaths when you are facing a situation that tests your patience; practice yoga regularly to calm your nerves; use self-affirmation by saying 'I choose to be calm in any situation'; write down your affirmation daily to imprint the goal,\" reads the site."

      "Bad teeth can be painful -- and worse. They can even be deadly. Infections   of the gums   and the teeth can cause bacteria   to go into the blood system. Those bacteria can increase the chance of a heart attack and worsen the effects of other diseases. And adults are not the only ones at risk.\nFor example, in 2007, doctors in the Washington area said a boy died when a tooth infection spread to his brain. They said it might have been prevented had he received the dental care   he needed. He was twelve years old.\nExperts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care starts at birth. Breast milk, they say, is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow the growth of bacteria and acid production in the mouth.\nBut dentists say a baby's gums and early teeth should be cleaned after each feeding. Use a cloth with a little warm water. Do the same if a baby is fed with a bottle. Experts say if you decide to put your baby to sleep with a bottle, only give the child water.\nWhen baby teeth begin to appear, you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies and to use them very gently.\nThe use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. For example, it is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel   , the hard surface on teeth, to help prevent holes from forming."

      "Time spent in a bookshop can be most enjoyable, whether you are a book-lover or only there to buy a book as a present. You may even have entered the shop just to hide from a sudden rain. Whatever the reason, you can soon totally unaware of your surroundings. You soon become interested in some books or others, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent too much time there and have to rush off to keep some forgotten appointment.\nThis chance to escape the realities of everyday life is the main attraction of a bookshop. A music shop is very much like a bookshop. You can walk around such a place for as long as you like. If it is a good shop, no assistant will come up to you with the greeting \"Can I help you?\"You needn't buy anything you don't want. In a bookshop an assistant should remain in the background until you have finished reading. Then, and only then, are his services necessary.\nOnce a medical student had to read a textbook which was far too expensive for him to buy. He couldn't borrow it from the library and the only copy he could find was in a certain bookshop. Every afternoon, therefore, he would go along to the shop and read a little of the book at a time. One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from his usual place. He was about to leave, when he noticed the owner of the shop beckoning to him. Expecting to be told off, he went towards him. To his surprise, the owner pointed to the book which was put away in a comer. \"I put it there so that nobody would try to buy it !\" He said, and left the delighted student continuing his reading."

Wild animals also learn by copying their parents and practicing. And pets learn through training.\nBut instincts and training aren't the only keys to animals' behavior. Scientists say animals' thoughts and feelings also influence their actions. Animals often make choices, plans, and sensible changes. They can help others and solve problems.

She uses sign language to argue, joke, and ask and answer questions. \n\"Most animals can't use words to tell us their thoughts,\" says Dr. Jonathan Balcombe. \"But Koko shows us that animals have their own ideas and feelings.\" Dr. Balcombe is a scientist at the Humane Society of the United States. He says there's even more to discover about animals through field studies. In field studies, people watch animals in their natural environment. \n\"Scientists who study animals' natural behaviors learn how animals live and think,\" Balcombe says. \"That knowledge can help others respect every animal who shares the planet with us.\""

      "Nineteen-year-old Christopher Paolini has always loved adventure books. In fact, he plotted out his first book, Eragon, when he was just fifteen!Eragon is selling more copies than most of the Harry Potter books. A reporter from Who's News talked to this young author about his books and how he ended up being one of the best-selling authors of all time!\nReporter :  _                                                                   \nChristopher Paolini (CP): I love fantasy. I love the sense of awe   and wonder that you always get at the end of a great book . Eragon was an attempt to express  _ . When I was about twelve, I read a book called Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher. It's about a young boy who went into a mysterious shop and bought a dragon egg that ends up hatching. It stuck in my head. Eragon was an attempt to see what I could do with the idea myself.\nReporter : Where else do you get your idea?\nCP: I'm definitely influenced by authors who have a fairly inventive use of language, imaginative worlds and a sense of wonder--authors who write about things that other people don't.\nReporter : What was the hardest thing about writing Eragon? \nCP: Probably the editing   because I wasn't used to it. It was a kind of shock doing it. But also I had to learn a huge amount about grammar and commas and other things I'd never paid much attention to before. I'd say that editing and writing are pretty much equal in difficulty. My raw writing is a lot more professional now than it ever was before because of everything I learned through the editing process.\nReporter : How do you avoid becoming frustrated with the writing process?\nCP: Write about what you enjoy the most or what touches you the most; otherwise you'll never be able to survive a book-length project. \nReporter : Anything else you'd like to share with our readers?\nCP: Before I wrote Eragon, I spent an entire month plotting out the entire story so I wasn't writing blindly. That helps. I really poured my heart and soul into it. It's not just an adventure story: it is about Eragon trying to work out who we are, why we are here and how we can live honorably."

      "If you have to miss a meal a day, which meal will cause you fewest health problems if you don't eat it? If you have to make a decision of this type, most people (especially very busy people) will choose to skip breakfast.\nHowever, many experts in the field of health consider breakfast ( the meal which \"break\" you \"fast\" ) to be the most important t meal of the day. If we eat a good breakfast, they say, we will have the energy and nutrients   we need to begin our working day with vigor  and stay hopeful with good honor. However, many people skip breakfast or _ . What happens if we ignore the importance of breakfast?\nOne recent study conducted in the United States tested a large number of people. Participants included both males and females who ranged in age from 12 to 83. The results showed that if a person eats an adequate breakfast, he or she will work more efficiently and more productively than if he or she skips breakfast or eats a very poor breakfast. This fact appears to be especially true if a person's work involves mental  activities. The study showed that if school-children eat fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, they will learn more quickly and will be able to concentrate  on their lessons for a longer period of time than if their breakfast is inadequate.\nThe study also showed that contrary to what people believe, if you skip breakfast, you will not lose weight. This is because people become so hungry if they skip breakfast that they eat too much for lunch and end up gaining weight instead of losing. So remember, if you want to lose weight, skipping breakfast will not help you. You will likely lose more weight if you decrease your other meals."

      "A report from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Commission reveals that, due to a job market which disproportionately rewards graduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics) fields, more and more students are seeking degrees in business and hard-science subjects.\nSome institutions have responded by cutting budgets in the arts and humanities and directing those  funds elsewhere. That's the wrong thing to do. The humanities-the study of languages , literature, history,  philosophy, religion, ethics, etc.-and the arts are vital to our future. We should be investing more funds,  more time and more expertise, not less, into these endeavors.\nWhat detractors  of the \"soft\" subjects miss is that the arts and humanities provide an essential framework and context for understanding the wider world. Studying the humanities strengthens the ability to communicate and work with others. It allows students to develop broad intellectual and cultural understanding; it nurtures creativity and deepens participation in public discourse and modem democracy.\nThe commission's report points out that \"at the very moment when China is seeking to adopt our model of broad education in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences as a stimulus to  invention, the United States is instead narrowing our focus and abandoning our sense of what education has been and should continue to be - our sense of what makes America great.\"\nThese are the telling statistics: First, federal funding for helping American students include international training in their education has been cut 41 percent in four years. Second, the National  Assessment of Educational Progress test shows that only less than a quarter of eighth- and 12th-grade US students are proficient in reading, writing and civics.\nHow can we possibly equip the US for its leadership role in an increasingly connected world if we are not adequately teaching students to communicate and helping them understand and encounter diverse perspectives? If we fail to invest in the arts and humanities, our country's future leaders will not have the ability to connect on an emotional level with others. This ability is developed by studying the humanities, and in the global community this skill is not optional - it's essential.\nIn a word, we must enthusiastically support and fund the study of the arts and humanities. For anyone concerned with how this translates into a sound economy and a sound financial future, simply recall what Steve Jobs told graduates of Standford University in 2005: One of the most influential experiences in his brief time at Reed College was his exposure to the fine art of calligraphy . It taught him the important lesson of the relationship between discipline and creativity."

      "If you come across the news of the death of Mr. Bean (actor Rowan Atkinson) on your Facebook account and you are curious to know more by opening a link, then think twice. Because the news is fake, a message about his suicide.\nThe fake news created tense moments for the fans of Atkinson who were curious to know why the actor took the step. Apparently, rumours said that the 58-year-old actor took his life after a producer dropped him from Johnny English 3. Later, it was found that both the news were fake. Such rumours have their origins in social platforms, where it is not easy to track who made them.\nTrishneet Arora, ethical hacker from the city, said: \"Culprits are aware that Facebook does not store data on its servers, so the chances of getting tracked are less with such platforms. Many rumours have been spread using such platforms. Since one cannot stop the culprits, users should always cross-check the news with news websites, and only then believe these. On platforms like Facebook, one should resist clicking on any links, because it can pass on your login and password details to the hackers. Besides, one should forward news links only after checking out from reputed news websites.\"\nSo, if you click on his so-called \"suicide video\", you could unwittingly install malware in your system through which the hacker can access your personal details like logins and passwords.\nAnkit Aggarwal, a resident of Tagore Nagar, said: \"I have also been a great fan of actor Rowan Atkinson, so the news of his death was quite shocking for me. The moment I read it, I shared the same on my wall. Later, through a friend, who had done her research well on the news, I got to know the news was false. So, I immediately removed the post from my wall and also asked my friends on Facebook not to forward the same news.\"\nMany stars in the past, including Jackie Chan, Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, and Miley Cyrus, have become victims to such death hoaxes . No police official was available for any comment."

      "Man, a land animal. But he is also closely tied to the sea. Throughout history the sea has served the needs of man. The sea has provided man with food and a convenient way to travel to many parts of the world. Today, nearly two-thirds of the world's population live within 80 kilometers of the sea coast.\nIn the modern technological world, the sea offers many resources to help mankind survive. Resources on land are beginning to be used up. The sea, however, still can be hoped to supply many of man's needs.\nThe list of riches of the sea yet to be developed by man's technology is big. Oil and gas explorations have been carried out for nearly 30 years. Valuable amounts of minerals exist on the ocean floor ready to be mined.\nFish farming promises to be a good way to produce large quantities of food. The culture of fish and shellfish   is an ancient skill practised in the past mainly by _ , including people in China.\nBesides oil and gas, the sea may offer new sources of energy. Experts believe that the warm temperature of the ocean can be used in a way similar to the steam in a steamship. Ocean currents and waves offer possible use as a source of energy.\nTechnology is enabling man to explore ever more deeply under the sea. The development of strong, new materials has made this possible.\nThe technology to harvest the sea continues to improve. Experts believe that by the year 2020 the problems that prevent us from exploiting  fully the food, minerals, and energy sources of the sea will be largely solved."

      "Demands for stronger protection for wildlife in prefix = st1 /Britainsometimes hide the fact that similar needs are felt in the rest of Europe. Studies by the Council of Europe, of which 21 countries are members, have shown that 45 per cent of reptile  species and 24 per cent of butterflies are in danger or dying out.\nEuropean concern for wildlife was outlined by Dr Peter Baum, an expert in the environment and natural resources division of the council, when he spoke at a conference arranged by the administrators of a British national park. The park is one of the few areas in Europe to hold the council's diploma for nature reserves of the highest quality, and Dr Baum had come to present it to the park once again. He was afraid that public opinion was turning against national parks, and that those set up in the 1960s and 1970s could not be set up today. But Dr Baum clearly remained a strong supporter of the view that natural environments needed to be allowed to survive in peace in their own right.\n\"No area could be expected to survive both as a true nature reserve and as a tourist attraction,\" he went on. The shortsighted view that reserves had to serve immediate human demands for outdoor recreation should be replaced by full acceptance of their importance as places to preserve nature for the future.\n\"We forget that they are the guarantee   of life systems, on which any built-up area depends,\" Dr Baum went on. \"We could manage without most industrial products, but we could not manage without nature. However, our natural environment areas, which are the original parts of our countryside, have become mere islands in a spoiled and highly polluted land.\""

      "For millions of Facebook users, choosing which photo to use for an online profile is an important decision. According to a study by researchers at the UT Dallas Center, the photos we select may reflect individual preferences, but they also appear to reflect more deeply rooted, unconscious cultural differences. Previous research has shown that culture can affect not only language and custom, but also how we experience the world and process information. Western cultures,for example,condition people to think of themselves as highly independent entities ( ),whereas East Asian cultures stress collectivism and interdependence.\nDr. Denise Park, co-director of the Center at UT Dallas, and former graduate student Dr. ChihMao Huang of the University of Illinois, were curious about whether these patterns of cultural influence extend to cyberspace. In a paper published in the International Journal of Psychology, they examined the profile photographs of more than 500 active Facebook users from the United States and\nEast Asia. Overall, they found that profile photos of Americans are more likely to focus on the individual's face,while the profiles of East Asians tend to less emphasize the face and include more background features. Americans also show greater smile intensity compared to East Asian Facebook users.\nThe findings show marked cultural differences in the focus of attention among East Asian and American Facebook users. Moreover, they echo previous research on cultural influences on visual perception ,attention, and reasoning in the offline world.\n\"We believe these findings relate to a cultural bias to be more individualistic and independent in the US and more communal and interdependent in Asia,,,said Park.\nThe research also found that cultural influences over our self-presentation online can shift over time and from place to place. In one of the study samples, Americans studying in Japan and Japanese studying in the US both showed a tendency to adjust their profile photos to the general preferences of their host country.\n\" Facebook constitutes an extended social context in which personal profiles mirror various individual characteristics,private thoughts,and social behaviors,\" noted Huang. \" As such,the study presents a new approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. \""

      "Before I came to China, I had heard that, although North Americans eat more than Chinese, Chinese eat better. Since I have come to China, I have been able to experience these differences first-hand. A whole new world of food has been opened up to me.\n   Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals  associated with eating. For example, shortly after arriving, I was gently criticized for filling somebody's teacup all the way up instead of half way. This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave.\n   There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food. But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation, serving and consumption  of food in China. This was an idea that was totally new to me!\n   More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal. They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please.\n   Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese  _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from. I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to.\n   One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin. Its menu was based on seafood. I was still  ly new to the concept   that your fish would be brought live to your table. In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand. Something we don't like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption.\n   However, having been in China for one year, I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening's meal. I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty.\n   The meal was winding its way  along without any problems. Then they brought out the lobster . I looked at it and then looked at it again and noticed that it was still moving! It had been brought out live to show that our raw lobster was indeed very fresh.\n   At that point, I nearly lost it. It took all my composure  for me to stay seated at the table and hurl  myself in the bathroom and bring up the contents of the previous dishes.  \n   Now the interesting thing is that when I tell that story to a foreigner, the reaction is always the same: Horror, sympathy, shock. When I tell the same story to Chinese, they don't understand my point of view. In fact, I often think that they believe that there is something truly wrong with me and not with the fact a lobster had been served live at the table."

      "Location: Worlds of Fun is located off Highway 435 in Kansas City, Missouri.\nHistory: Worlds of Fun was opened on May 26, 1973, at a cost of 25 million dollars. Loosely themed around the Jules Verne book, Around the World in Eighty Days, the park was founded by Hunt Midwest Company. In 1982, Hunt Midwest bought a nearby waterpark, Oceans of Fun. In 2013, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun were combined to a one-ticket admission, providing all guests with access to  235 acres of amusement and water rides.\nHours: Worlds of Fun is open from April through Halloween.\nTickets: Buy and print online. Always try to buy your tickets in advance, to save time when you get to the park.\nReservations: World of Fun sells \" Fast Lane\" cards that save rides' time by allowing them to avoid the majority of wait for most of rides and attractions including Mamba, Plowler, and Patriot. Ride as many times as you want all day long.\nStrategy : Most visitors tend to  begin in the day with Prowler, the hottest attraction in the park. Use that tendency to your advantage and head to the Patriot first. After that, try the Dragons. Then work your way back to the Prowler. After riding the Prowler, there is only one roller coaster, Mamba. Hit it next. If the park is not very crowded, you can ride Boomerang on the way to Mamba. After riding Mamba, head back for a ride on the Wolf. By then you will have tried most of the popular rides and attractions in the shortest possible time.\nNews: In 2014, Worlds of Fun is adding Steel Hawk, a ride that will take guests up 301 feet in the air and spin them at a 45-degree angle for a 60-second flight. Wait to have a try."

      "There's no doubt that our character has a profound effect on our future. What we must remember, however, is not merely how powerful character is in influencing our fate  , but how powerful we are in shaping our own character and, therefore, our own fate. Character may determine our fate, but character is not determined by fate.\nIt's a common mistake to think of character as something that is fully formed and fixed very early in life. It calls to mind old proverbs like \"A leopard can't change its spots\" and \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\"\nThis perspective that our character is \"etched in stone\" is supported by a great deal of modern psychology emphasizing self-acceptance. As Popeye says, \"I am what I am.\" The hidden message is:Don't expect me to be more, better, or different.\nUltimately, these views of humanity totally undervalue the lifelong potential for growth that comes with the power of reflection and choice.\nHow depressing it would be to believe that we can't choose to be better, more honest, more respectful, more responsible, and more caring. None of us should give up the personal seeking to improve our character. Not because we're bad, we don't have to be sick to get better , but because we're not as good as we could be.\nThere are so many things in life we can't control, whether we're beautiful or smart, whether we had good parents or bad, whether we grew up with affirmation or negation. It's inspiring to remember that nothing but moral will power is needed to make us better.\nNo, it isn't easy. But if we make a great effort to become more aware of the habits of heart and mind that drive our behavior, we can begin to place new emphasis on our higher values so that we become what we want our children to think we are."

      "Launched in 1935, Social Security is a federal program that provides money for retirees, the disabled and living family members of workers who have died.\n  Social Security benefits are funded through a Social Security tax that most U.S. employees pay. However, the money that employees pay is not held in a personal account that they can later draw from. Instead, the tax they pay now is being used to pay people who are currently receiving benefits.\n  Although most of the people receiving Social Security are retirees, many others are  _ for assistance. These recipients  include the disabled, a spouse  or child of someone who gets Social Security, a spouse or child of a worker who died, or a dependent parent of a worker who died.\n  Depending on circumstances, people may be eligible for Social Security benefits at any age. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, 85 cents of every dollar Social Security is used for current retires and their families, as well as surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. The other 15 cents is used for people with disabilities and their families.\n  When employees are ready to receiver their Social Security, payments are based on how much they earned during their career, with higher lifetime earnings resulting in higher monthly benefits. \n  Benefits amounts are also affected by the age at which an employee decides to retire. Payments are available as early as age 62, but the value would be about 25 percent lower than what's collected by those who wait until full retirement age, which ranges from 66 to 67 years old depending on the year in which they were born. \n  Today, about 159 million people work and pay Social Security taxes, and roughly 55 million receive monthly benefits."

      "Visit any junior high or high school and you will experience the power of influence. Clothing, hairstyles, attitudes and even the language are all gained by some amount of influence, whether it is from commercials, fashion, trends, celebrities or music. Teens and preteen children are influenced by these various factors. However, a child's friends are the No. 1 influence.\nBefore you think your children's friends could never lead one another astray  , think again. A child may experience an event that has caused overwhelming stress or may have problems at home or school, which causes negative behavior. Negative influences of a child's friends can come without warning.\n\"Parents who ask their children where they are going, who they are going with and request a meeting with their children's friends and the friends' parents have already taken the first step,\" says Mara Berkley, family therapist and professor at Bristol University in Rhode Island.\nLynn Rexroat of Chillicothe, Illinois, uses this method to _ her children. \"My oldest son knows that in order for him to go anywhere with a friend, especially one I haven't met before, I have to speak with that friend's parent to make sure the arrangements are agreeable with us both,\" she says. \"I don't interrogate   them by asking about their private life. I just want to know that the parents of the other child know what the boys are planning to do. I feel that by my wanting to know I am protecting my son.\"\nWhen a parent suspects that their child is hanging out with \"the wrong crowd\", the last thing on their mind should be discipline. Instead, Berkley says a parent should be more interested in finding out the reasons behind the behaviors and the child's choice to keep company with these types of friends."

      "Taking a shower is relaxing. You can hum a song, daydream or think about nothing, leaving the real world behind you. But did you know that showering can also benefit your mind?\nA research by Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist from Yale University in the US interviewed over 3,000 people around the world. It turned out that nearly two-thirds of the interviewees said they had experienced new ideas in the shower and were more likely to have them in the shower than at work.\nSo why does a simple shower have such magic power? Science can explain it.\nShowering can help to raise our level of dopamine, a hormone   closely related to our creativity. \"People vary in terms of their level of creativity according to the activity of dopamine\", explained Alice Flaherty, a famous American neuroscientist. \"Taking a warm shower can make us feel relaxed and therefore make the dopamine level rise and bring 'Aha!' moment to us.\"\nBesides the chemical changes, showering may give you a break from what you feel you have been stuck with. Especially when you have thought hard all day about a problem, jumping into the shower can keep you from the outside world so that you can focus on your inner feelings and memories. In this way, according to American psychologist Shelley H. Carson, author ofYour Creative Brain, \"a showering hour may turn into an 'incubation   period' for your ideas.\"\nCompared with sitting in front of a computer, taking a shower is something we do less frequently in our daily life. When showering, we get a fresh experience with the change of location, temperature and humidity. \"New and unexpected experiences can lead to positive changes in thinking,\" explained Kaufman. \"Getting off the couch and jumping in the shower may create a distance and force you to think from a new point of view.\"\nShowering allows us to enjoy the creative juices of our minds, but it needn't just be the bathroom where you get your inspiration. For instance, Gertrude Stein, a female American writer and poet, got new ideas by driving around a farm and stopping at different cows until she found the one that most inspired her. So try to create your own way to free your mind, whether it's a walk near the ocean, a country drive or reading a book at home."

      "A caring mother is the most important single factor in preventing teenagers from abusing drugs and alcohol, researchers said on Friday. An international study showed that teenagers living with both parents are less likely to suffer from alcohol and drug problems, and a strong  _ is the most effective way to fight against them.\n\"These findings suggest that living with both parents may prevent drug use,\" said Dr. McArdle, of Newcastle University in northern prefix = st1 /England, who led the study. \"They also suggest that attachment, particularly to mothers, is a more effective factor and that this is truly across cultures and substances.\"\nThe report, which is published in the journal Addiction, involved nearly 4,000 teenagers in England,Ireland,Italy,Germanyand theNetherlands. They were questioned about their use of several kinds of drugs and alcohol. The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html)"

      "Hey, ladies! It's summer again and it's time for a new you! No more make-up, no more pretending! Yes, that's right! It's time to stop making ourselves beautiful for the camera, and start posting confident pictures without all the make-up and extra tricks we add onto ourselves in the hope of appearing more attractive and beautiful. Because believe it or not, we already are!\nAfter we wash our face and go to bed, it is not so perfect. You know it the face we should confidently be showing to the world! Who cares if you have pimples or your eyes look small, or if you have crow's feet? Guess what? Those are actually what make you such a beautifully grown woman. And any person who doesn't think so is just not as strong as you.\nNowadays we are so prone to do anything and everything to make us look as young and perfect as possible. Yet the troth is, by doing this, we are actually making our tree skin get worse and badly affected by all the junk we put on. We are making ourselves believe that by changing our appearance we will be more accepted and seem more attractive to other people. And yet, our final goal is to find that without all of the make-up. What kind of twisted game are we really playing with ourselves?\nSo I would like to make a suggestion for all women out there to give yourself a break at least this summer. Take a couple of pictures without all of that make-up on. You don't need it every single day, especially not this hot summer! You'll be surprised that the more confident you are about showing the real side of you, the more attractive you will be to everyone else.\nYes, the saying, \"Beauty comes from within\" is an old one, definitely still holds some troth today. So be brave, carefree, and make-up free! Let the world see you for who you really are!"

      "Wang Chuanfu, chairman of BYD Co.,Ltd., was named China's richest individual this week by Forbes magazine, which stated his wealth is worth $ 5.8 billion.\nWang grew up in a poor family in Anhui Province and had lost his parents for illness when he was a teenager. He went to college only after the encouragement and support of his older siblings  , who also helped him.\n\"I was born on a rice farm very, very poor,\" Wang told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last year. \"Both of my parents were farmers and they planted rice. Both passed away when I was still very young. I was about 10 years old when my father died, and I was 15 or so when my mother passed away. \"\nHe developed a fascination with batteries back in his university days in the mid-1980s, when he studied metallurgical   physics and chemistry. After receiving a Master's degree, he found a research position at the General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals in Beijing. It was an easy job, but he grew bored and decided to go out on his own just as China's experiment with capitalism   was going on.\nHe established the company that is now BYD in 1995, borrowing $300,000 from a cousin, and started out making batteries for cellphones. Today, the company still makes phone batteries but also produces gasoline- fueled cars that have made BYD a top-10 auto brand in China.\nThe company, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2002, is also getting ready to sell electric cars to private buyers and launch an all-electric battery car model soon in China. All this has helped BYD attract investors' attention, including from one of Warren Buffett's companies, and has helped enrich Wang as BYD's share price has increased.\nWang's fast climb shows personal struggle is still working in China even as the country faces widening gaps between the haves and the have-nots.\n\"Because I came from a poor background, I knew the only way for me to get ahead was to get good education. I studied very hard.\""

      "Long before the white man came to prefix = st1 /America, the land belonged to the American Indian nations. The nation of the Cherokees lived in what is now the southeastern part of theUnited States. After the white man came, the Cherokees copied many of their ways. One Cherokee named Sequoyah saw how important reading and writing was to the white man. He decided to invent a way to write down the spoken Cherokee language. He began by making word pictures. For each word he drew a picture. But that proved impossible -- there were just too many words. Then he took the 85 sounds that made up the language. Using his own imagination and an English spelling book, Sequoyah invented a sign for each sound. His alphabet proved amazingly easy to learn. Before long, many Cherokees knew how to read and write in their own language. By 1828, they were even printing their own newspaper.\nIn 1830, the U.S. Congress passed a law. It allowed the government to remove Indians from their lands. The Cherokees refused to go. They had lived on their lands for centuries. It belonged to them. Why should they go to a strange land far beyond the Mississippi River? \nThe army was sent to drive the Cherokees out. Soldiers surrounded their villages and marched them at gunpoint into the western territory. The sick, the old and the small children went in carts, along with their belongings. The rest of the people marched on foot or rode on horseback. It was November, yet many of them still wore their summer clothes. Cold and hungry, the Cherokees were quickly exhausted by the hardships of the journey. Many dropped dead and were buried by the roadside. When the last group arrived in their new home in March 1839, more than 4,000 had died. It was indeed a march of death."

      "ANIMALS have always been used to represent certain human characteristics. Countries also use animals as symbols. From eagles to lions, many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character.\nThe image of an eagle is on the US President's flag, and on the one-dollar bill. The bald eagle is a large, powerful, brown bird with a white head and tail. The term \"bald\" does not mean that this bird lacks feathers. Instead, it comes from the old word piebald, that menas, \"marked with white\".\nThe US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782. It was chosen because of \"its long life, great strength, and noble looks\".\nA few eagles have even become American heroes. An eagle named \"Old Abe\", the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War, traveled 14,000 miles with its men. He was often shot at by the enemy, but survived 42 battles.\nBut, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin didn't agree with the choice. \"The bald eagle ... is a bird of bad moral character, like those among men who live by robbing, he is generally poor, and often very messy,\" he argued. Franklin wanted the turkey as the country's national bird.\nIf Americans chose their national symbol deliberately, the symbol of England arose out of history.\nKing Herry I(1068-1135) was a brave warrior but also wise. His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice. He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol, which is popularly known as the \"king of the jungle\". By the year Richard I, known as \"The Lionheart\" for his bravery, came to the throne in 1189, the famous Three Lions badge had been formed. Now it can be seen on the shirts of England's sports teams.\nAlthough people might not think of lions when they think of England, everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo. Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers. When asked by the Europeans what these strange-looking animals were, a native replied \"kangaroo\", meaning \"I don't understand you.\"\nThe kangaroo is an individualistic animal. Although it does gather in groups, the kangaroo is not a herd animal. If a group is attacked, individuals run off in different directions. Australians think the kangaroo represents positive values, such as individual responsibility and pride."

      "In addition to seeing wonderful films, one of the joys of coming to the Quad Cinema is to hang out in the area. The Quad is located right in the heart of Greenwich Village, perhaps the most charming and interesting neighborhood in the city. Here are some attractions we recommend, all within a comfortable walk from the Quad:\nWashington Square\nAs one of the best-known of New York City's 1,900 public parks, it is a landmark in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village, as well as a meeting place and center for cultural activity. Come on a Sunday when it's most lively and festive.\nNew York University\nIt surrounds Washington Square. See the impressive Bobst Library and visit the amazing bookstore. NYU is now considered one of the most powerful universities in the world.\nJudson Memorial Church\nLocated on Washington Square south between Thompson Street and Sullivan Street, opposite Washington Square Park, this beautiful church was completed in 1892. The Judson is most famous for its vocal participation in social events.\nWashington Mews\nIt is a hidden, private street in New York City between Fifth Avenue and University Place just north of Washington Square Park. It was first developed as a mews (row of stables) that serviced horses from homes in the area. Since the 1950s the former stables have served as housing, offices and other facilities for New York University.\nJefferson Market Courthouse\nBuilt in 1833 as a market, it was later changed to a courthouse, and in the 1950s it was emptied and close to being destroyed. It was saved and turned into a library. Many consider it to be the most beautiful building in the village."

      "Seeing a volcano erupt is a wonderful experience, and you can really feel the beat by climbing to the summit  of Pacaya for a close-up view. There are guided tours every day up this highly active volcano from Antigua, giving travelers a chance to see Mother Nature at her most powerful.\nPacaya is an easy drive from Antigua, a beautiful city with many colorful houses along its old streets that are turned into art-works during its Holy Week festival. No matter when you come to Antigua, you won't miss the Pacaya-tour companies.\nBut climbing Pacaya is no easy job: it is 2560 metres high, and reaching the summit takes two to three hours of seemingly one-step-forward and two-step-back movements. As you climb, you hear the dull sounds of eruptions high above steaming. Hot remains from recent eruptions begin to line the path as you are near the active summit; the McKenney Cone .\nMany tours are timed so when you arrive at the cone of the volcano there is plenty of time for sunset and the full contrast between the erupting red lava and the darkening sky. On a good day the view from the summit is extremely exciting. The active mouth boils, sending red lava over its sides, and once in a while shoots hot streams up to 100 metres into the air. There is a strong bad smell in the air even if you take care to be upwind of the cone. As evening turns deeper into the night, the burning lava quietly falls down the side of the volcano. For you, too, it is time to get down ."

      "According to the most recent count, more than 6,500 homeless people sleep on the street or in shelters in San Francisco, and there are only eight shower facilities  specifically available to the homeless, and most of these have just one or two stalls and aren't open every day. Now San Francisco-based company Lava Mae, is trying to change that with a simple but smart idea--turning retired city buses into mobile showers for the homeless. The idea known as Lava Mae, is a response to the need of the homeless in the city.\nIt all started two years ago when Sandoval got in a cab after a meeting in the SoMa district of San Francisco, where the homeless mainly lived. \"My driver turned around and said, 'Welcome to the land of broken dreams.' \" Then Sandoval awoke from her imagination and started really look at the people around her. \" A woman I passed was crying and saying that she would never be clean\", Sandoval said. She took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. \nAfter doing some research, Sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses. Now she has reached an agreement with a bus company, which will donate the buses being retired in the next four years. \nWhile Lava Mae is now focused on the city of San Francisco, there is no reason that the idea cannot be spread all over the world."

      "\"Chances are we have all experienced shyness in our lives, and shyness has been associated with negative outcomes--characteristics like difficulty maintaining eye contact, and feelings of humiliation  are known to be part of a shy person's characters. It's these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals' ability to connect,\" says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University.\n\"But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage,\" Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:\nShy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.\nShy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation."

      "When I was young, I went looking for gold in California. I never found enough to make a rich strike. But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau. Like Heaven on Earth, it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees. By the time I arrived, the charming paradise had been deserted because miners' good luck didn't last.\nThen, I realized I was not alone after all.\nA man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house. Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers. White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind.\nStill smiling, the man invited me inside. My spirit seemed to come to life again. I saw a bright rug  on the shining wooden floor. And on little tables there were seashells, books and china vases full of flowers. A woman had made this house into a home. The joy in my heart showed on my face. The man read my thoughts. \"All her work.\" He said affectionately, \"Nothing here hasn't felt the touch of her hand.\"\nOne picture on the wall was not hanging straight. He went to fix it. He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight. Then he gave it a gentle touch. \"She always does that,\" he explained, \"It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child's hair after she has brushed it. I don't know why I do it. I just do it.\"\nAs he talked, I went to a little black-walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman's expression. The man stared at the picture. \"Nineteen her last birthday. That was the day we married. When you see her...ah, just wait until you meet her!\" \"Where is she now?\" I asked. \"Oh, she is away visiting her parents. This is Wednesday,\" he said slowly. \"She will be back on Saturday, in the evening.\"\nThat night, I stayed. The man told me his name was Henry.\nThursday evening we had two visitors, Tom and Joe. \"We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home. Any news from her?\" \"Oh yes,\" the man replied. \"A letter.\" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it. It was full of loving messages. While reading, he glimpsed his friends and cried out, \"Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes. I'm going to tell her this time!\" \"No, you mustn't do that, Henry,\" the grey-haired miner said. \"I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. Lord, we miss her so.\"\nSaturday finally came.\nI was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, with guitars, coming down the road as the sun began to set. They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs.\nHenry's friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey. When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. \"Drop that! Take the other.\" he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. \"Boys,\" he said, \"I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down.\" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth.\nIn a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, \"Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger.\" They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, \"She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!\" \"Dead?\" I whispered. \"That or worse.\" he said.\n\"She went to see her folks half a year after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. She's never been heard of since. Henry _ . He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. We drop in here, three days before she's due, to encourage him up and listen to him read the letter. On Saturday we all come and get everything ready for a dance. We've done it for nineteen years. The first Saturday there were twenty-seven of us, but only two now. We drug him to sleep through the night. Then he's all right for another year.\"\nThe two old men opened the door and disappeared into the darkness of Stanislau."

      "Nowadays, studying abroad gains popularity in China. Many parents would rather send their children abroad to receive education than let them be educated in China.\nEvery coin has two sides and studying abroad is no exception . There are advantages for people to attend school abroad. In the first place, he can use the foreign language in his daily life so that his ability in the second language may be greatly improved, as it is obvious that there is no better opportunity to improve second language skills than living in the country where it is spoken. While studying in a foreign country, he will mostly meet many others from overseas and it is possible to make friends with people from all over the world. This is not only exciting on the social level, but could lead to important overseas contacts in his career as well. He can learn the latest knowledge in science and make use of the first-rate facilities  available. In this way, there are many chances for him to widen his horizons and broaden his mind.\nOf course, attending school abroad may bring about a series of problems as well. The most serious problem is language barrier . Not all of the students who plan to go abroad are good at the language spoken there. As a result, on arriving there, they will find it difficult to understand what the teachers say. Besides, for lack of knowledge of the customs of the local people, they may constantly  run into trouble in dealing with various situations. Furthermore, the tuition and the cost of living are much higher than those in our country, which may add more burdens to their family.\nTherefore, given an opportunity to attend a school abroad, one must consider both its advantages and its disadvantages carefully before making up his mind."

      "Just up the road from my home is a field, with two horses in it. From a distance, each horse looks like any other horses. But if you get a more careful look, you will notice something quite amazing.\nOne of the horses is blind. His owner has chosen not to kill it, but has made him a safe and comfortable barn to live in. This alone is very amazing. But if you stand nearby and listen, you will hear the sound of a bell. It is coming from a smaller horse with a small, gold-colored bell. It lets the blind friend know where the other horse is, so he can follow. As you stand and watch these two friends, you'll see that the horse with the bell is always checking on the blind horse and makes sure that the blind horse can hear the bell, slowly walk to where he is, and won't get lost.\nWhen the horse with the bell returns to the barn each evening, he will sometimes stop to look back, making sure that the blind friend isn't too far behind to hear the bell.\nLike the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us away just because we are not perfect, or because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in trouble. Sometimes we are the blind horse which is being guided by the little ringing bells. And at other times we are the guide horse, helping others to find their way."

      "The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old. By 2050, it's projected to be one out of 5. This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.\nProfessor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. \"Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly,\" he said.\nAging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained."

      "Why do we call the sounds of birds, whales and insects songs? Because something about what we hear seems to have beauty, and some mellifluous   structure that touches us more than any possible message. Though for many years science has cautioned against hearing too much of what we humans would like to hear when we are trying to understand animal sounds, the musicality in some sounds is now starting to have an effect on the science of animal communication itself.\nMany specific animal sounds express aggression , warning, or food, but such practical explanations are tough to apply to the long songs. Some whale songs can go on for up to 24 hours. The usual explanation for birdsong is that the birds are singing to attract mates or to announce the limits of their area. But the audience is not always evident for these long love songs, which have many of the elements related to human music: rhythm, melody  , themes, repeating patterns, organization, variety, interest -- all adding up to something humans have found beautiful for thousands of years. \"Birds taught man,\" wrote Roman poet and philosopher   Lucretius, \"and taught them songs before their art began.\"\nWhat is the scientific value of such sounds? The advantage of hearing music in nature and trying to reach out to nature through music is that though we don't fully understand it, it is so accessible.\nMusic refuses explanation, but it clearly expresses something deep and important, which humans can't live without. Finding music in the sound of birds, whales and other animals makes the farther frontiers  of nature see much closer to us."

      "Dogs and millionaires have a lot in common. They are absolute opportunists (especially when it comes to rewards). They defend their territory . And in general, they don't like cats. Perhaps that explains a new survey showing that millionaires are far more dog-friendly than the rest of Americans.\nAccording to a study by Spectrem Group, 58% of millionaire pet owners have a dog. Only 37% own a cat. Only 3% keep fish, 2% birds and 2% have a horse. Similarly, 39% of U. S. households own a dog, compared to 33% of households owning a cat, released by the Humane Society.\nJennifer Cona, a trust and estates attorney  and partner with Genser Subow Genser & Cona in New York, does a lot of work on pet trusts. She said of all the pet trusts she's worked on, 90% are for dogs and only 10% are for cats.\nShe said dogs provide one thing especially important for the wealthy: unconditional love.\n\"You don't get that from a cat,\" she said, \"Dogs are like children for some families, except that they don't mess up in college or run off with money. Sometimes it's easy to see why dogs are the favorite children.\"\nMillionaires show their love for their dogs in part by their spending. One quarter of millionaire pet owners spend more than $1, 000 a year on their pets, the Spectrem study said, while more than half spend more than $500 a year.\nMany would say those numbers are understated, given all the diamond-dog collars, dog foods and booming dog spas in evidence these days, not to mention the medical bills.\nThe survey showed 34% of pet owners spend money on decorating, while 6% spend on \"sweaters, outfits and costumes.\"\nMore than half of millionaire pet owners spend money on teeth cleaning for their pets. More than 16%, meanwhile, said they would spend money on reconstructive surgeries and \"anti-anxiety, anti-depression\" medication for their pets."

      "New data from NASA's Curiosity rover indicate Mars Crater once held an enormous lake. This discovery suggests that the red planet may have been much wetter than scientists thought and raises the possibility that the planet was once habitable.\n\"The size of the lake and the length of time and series that water was showing up implies that there may have been sufficient time for life to develop.\" NASA's Mars Exploration Program scientist Dr. Michael Meyer told Reuters.\nCuriosity collected the new data on its five-mile drive to Mount Sharp, the prime destination on its mission to study Mars' climate and geography. The rover landed in Gale Crater in August 2012.\nAfter reaching Mount Sharp in September, the rover spent two months studying rocks at the base of the three-mile-high mountain, discovering fine layers of mudstone--which tend to collect at the bottom of lakes. This shows how a mountain inside a Mars' Gale Crater might have formed.\n\"If our assumption for Mount Sharp holds up, it challenges the idea that warm and wet conditions were passing, local, or only underground on Mars,\" Dr. Ashwin Vasavada said in a written statement. \"A more radical explanation is that Mars' ancient, thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally, but so far we don't know how the atmosphere did that.\"\nVasavada said Curiosity will continue to study changes in the rock formation as it climbs Mount Sharp in the next few months, which should test the team's hypothesis.\n\"We'll also look at the chemistry of the rocks to see if the water that was once present would've been of the kind that could support microbial life, if it ever was present,\" he said in a video released by NASA. \"With only 30 vertical feet of the mountain behind us, we're sure there's a lot more to discover.\""

      "It's interesting that technology often works as a servant for us, yet frequently we become a servant to it. E-mail is a useful tool but many feel controlled by this new tool. The average business person is getting about 80e-mails per day and many feel that about 80% of the messages in their \"Inbox\" are of little or no value. So, I have four suggestions to help you to become better at \"Erasing E-mail\".\n1.Get off the lists. The best way to deal with a problem is to never have it. If you are receiving a lot of unwanted e-mails, ask to be removed from the various lists. This would include your inclusion in unwanted lists.\n2.\"Unlisted address\". Just as you keep an \"unlisted\" telephone number that you share only with those whom you want to have direct access to, you might want to get a separate e-mail address only for the important communications you wish to receive.\n3.Check it once or twice per day. Many I speak with are becoming chained to their email server, monitoring incoming email continuously. Maybe this is because e-mail creates its own sense of urgency, but most of thecommunications are not all that urgent. I respond to them a couple of times per day.\n4.Deal with it. As you open each e-mail, do one of the following:\na. If it requires a quick response, respond to it and delete it.\nb. If it requires a response but is not the best use of your time, try to find someone else to do it.\nc. If it is going to take any serious amount of time to respond, schedule it for action in your Day Planner andthen download the message, save it, or print it out for future action.\nI personally receive about 250 e-mails per day and by practicing the suggestions above, I can handle thatvolume in about an hour, taking advantage of this fantastic tool but not being controlled by it to make sure I'mdoing more important tasks in my day."

      "A few weeks ago a group of scientists produced a report about global warming and the natural world.They wanted to find out if global warming was dangerous for plants and animals.The scientists were surprised by what they found.They say that during the next 50 years about 25% of land animals and plants will become extinct .More than 1 million plant and animal species will become extinct by 2050.\nThe head of the research team, Christ Thomas, who is professor of conservation biology at Leeds University, said the results of their research were frightening.More than 10% of all plants and animals will become extinct.It is too late to save many plants and animals because of the greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere.But the scientists say if we control greenhouse gases now, we could save many more plants and animals from extinction.\nThe scientists studied some areas of the world with a very rich biology.These areas were Europe, Australia, Central and South America, and South Africa.Their studies showed that species living in mountainous areas had a better chance of survival because they could move uphill to get cooler.In flat areas, such as deserts, plants and animals would have to move very long distances to get cooler, so they are in greater danger of extinction.The scientists found many surprising things.For example, they found that half of the 24 species  of butterfly they studied in Australia would soon become extinct."

Football, for example, has spread around the world. Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers.

      "Grandparents might be known for spoiling grandchildren, but a new study says they might also be helping the kids improve their social skills and behavior.\nSpending time with grandma and grandpa especially appears to help children from single-parent, divorced/separated or stepfamily households, according to the report, published in the February Journal of Family Psychology.\n\"Grandparents are a positive force for all families but play a significant role in families undergoing difficulties,\" the study's lead author, Shalhevet Attar-Schwartz, of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said in an American Psychological Association news release. \"They can reduce the negative influence of parents separating and be a resource for children who are going through these family changes.\"\nIn interviewing 11- to 16-year olds from England and Wales, Attar-Schwartz and her team found that the more conversations the youths had with a grandparent, including asking for advice or even money, the better they got along with their peers and the fewer problems they had, such as hyperactivity and disruptive behavior.\n\"This was found across all three family structures,\" she said. \"But adolescents in single-parent households and stepfamilies benefited the most. The effect of their grandparents' involvement was stronger compared to children from two biological parent families.\"\nThe study did not look at children who lived solely with their grandparents, though.\nThe findings have great implications for people in the United States, the authors said, because American grandparents are increasingly sharing living space with their grandchildren. A 2004 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more than 5 million households include a grandparent and a grandchild under 18, up 30 percent since 1990, according to background information in the news release."

These were then sold across the city, including large supermarkets such as Hualian, Lianhua and Dia.\nFewer steamed buns were for sale at this Lianhua Supermarket. More than 32,000 buns were taken off store shelves when the scandal emerged.\nMr. Wang, Sales Manager of Lianhua Supermarket, said, \"We removed the dyed steamed buns produced by Shenglu as soon as we learned of the incident. We gave customers who had bought the steamed buns from our outlets refunds with their receipts. Despite the scandal, our sales volume has been fine so far.\"\nHowever, most customers we met remained concerned about food safety. Steamed buns are a regular breakfast food for Ms. Gao.

      "Lots of people like a good fright at Halloween . Yet, the most frightening thing of all about the night is that twice as many children are killed while out and about on Halloween compared to any other day of the year, according to a study by Safe Kids Worldwide. It can also be a worrying time for others, especially elderly people living alone. But many people think it's just harmless fun.\nBut is it harmless fun?\nPolice forces across Britain are giving warnings about Halloween night. They are asking all those wishing to celebrate Halloween this year to respect those who don't want to join in.\nSome forces, like West Mercia Police, have produced \"Sorry, No Trick or Treat\"posters which can be downloaded from their website, and put up in windows. They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts  knocking on their doors.\nA spokesman said: \"Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up, neither should they call on strangers, as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious, especially those who are elderly or living alone.\"\nThe police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . \"What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record,\" they warn. \"Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home, instead.\"\nKent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they don't know--and to remember not to frighten people.\nWarwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others. They say behaviour such as throwing eggs can quickly cross the line between being anti-social and causing criminal damage. This can result in fines of PS2,500 for small offences."

      "At the age of seven I started taking violin lessons. I practiced half an hour every day, went to lessons once a week, and occasionally played in a group concert. Like most kids, I always thought practicing was boring. If my parents hadn't been there to make me practice, I probably would have put down my violin and never have picked it up again.\nI met Moira when I was 11 at an Irish music party. Moira hosted the party that night, playing the violin, singing and dancing. She made sure that everyone in the room got involved and had a great time. I immediately fell in love with the music she played and the energy that she brought to it. Just a few days after that party, I took my first lesson with Moira, and I continued taking lessons with Moira throughout middle school.\nWhen I started playing the violin with Moira, playing music became something that I loved. She introduced me to so many types of music, from Irish to Old Time, to Cajun. Moira also taught me to play the guitar. Soon we started performing together and were shocked to discover that people actually wanted to hear us! When I began to play the violin, practicing was something that I did at home in my living room, but with Moira's influence it quickly became something that I did everywhere. I played on street corners, at festivals, at the beach, at parties, at weddings, and late at night in my friends' kitchens.\nMoira took the music out to the classroom and brought it to life. Her passion was not only for playing music, but also for sharing it. My time with Moira allowed me to grow both musically and personally. I have met so many special people and had so many invaluable  experiences. Moira has proven to be the most important influence in my musical development, and also my invaluable friend."

      "I once thought that outer beauty is the only factor to become a great person.When I was young, I read many kinds of books, most of which described characters who are handsome or beautiful. So I think that being beautiful is the only way to become a success.\nAs I grew up,the story of my best friend made me realize that outer beauty was not so important to make a person successful. She is so beautiful a girl that every classmate liked to chat with her, but she was very arrogant .In her opinion, she could get all she wanted because of her beauty, but all of her friends left her one by one! Only then did she come to know the importance of the beauty in a person's heart, which changed her attitude and she made friends again.\nTurning on TV,we can see many advertisements, most of which seem to give us a feeling that, physical attractiveness is the most important thing.T _ .It is surprising that more and more people,especially girls and women, try it like the first man-made beauty in China, Hao Lulu. It is a common sense that attractive people can easily find work. Most good looking guys, usually get higher scores in the job interviews. But, what is real beauty? I want to say that is inner beauty because those who have beauty in their soul are really beautiful persons.\nAs is known, the beauty judged with eyes is temporary, so we should concentrate on inner beauty. And if we make the efforts to make our minds beautiful, we'll live a happier life."

      "Some say every day miracles are predestined  ---- All that's necessary is readiness, the right circumstance for the appointed meeting. And it can happen anywhere.\nIn 1999, 11-year-old Kevin Stephan was a bat boy for his younger brother's Little League team in Lancaster, New York. It was an early evening in late July. Kevin was standing on the grass away from the plate, where another youngster was warming up for the next game. Swinging his bat back and forth, and giving it all the power an elementary school kid could give, the boy brought the bat back hard and hit Kevin in the chest. His heart stopped.\nWhen Kevin fell to the ground, the mother of one of the players rushed out of the stands to his aid. Penny Brown hadn't planned to be there that day, but at the last minute,she had changed  her shift   at the hospital, and she was given the night off. Penny bent over the senseless boy, his face already starting to turn blue, and giving CPR, breathing into his mouth and giving chest compressions  . And he came to life.\nAfter his recovery, he became a volunteer junior firefighter, learning some of the emergency first-aid techniques that had saved his life. He studied hard in school and was saving money for college by working as a dishwasher in a local restaurant in his spare time.\nKevin, now 17, was working in the kitchen when he heard people screaming, customers in confusion, employees rushing toward a table. He hurried into the main room and saw a woman there, her face turning blue, her hands at her throat. She was choking .\nQuickly Kevin stepped behind her, wrapped his arms around her and clasped his hands. Then, using skills he'd first learned in Scouts, the food that was trapped in the woman's throat was freed. The color began to return to her face.\n\"The food was stuck. I couldn't breathe,\" she said. She thought she was dying. \"I was very frightened.\"\nWho was the woman?\nPenny Brown."

      "I was born on the 17th of November 1828, in the village of Nam Ping, which is about four miles southwest of the Portuguese Colony   of Macao, and is located on Pedro Island lying west of Macao, from which it is separated by a channel of half a mile wide.\nAs early as 1834, an English lady, Mrs. Gutzlaff, wife of a missionary to China, came to Macao. Supported by the Ladies' Association in London for the promotion of female education in India and the East, she immediately took up the work of starting a girls' school for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the opening of a boys' school.\nMrs. Gutzlaff's comprador  happened to come from my village and was actually my father's friend and neighbor. It was through him that my parents heard about Mrs. Gutzlaff's school and it was doubtlessly through his influence and means that my father got me admitted into the school. It has always been a mystery to me why my parents should put me into a foreign school, instead of a traditional Confucian school, where my big brother was placed. Most certainly such a step would have been more suitable for Chinese public opinion, taste, and the wants of the country, than to allow me to attend an English school. Moreover, a Chinese belief is the only avenue in China that leads to political promotion, influence, power and wealth. I can only guess that as foreign communication with China was just beginning to grow, my parents hoped that it might be worthwhile to put one of their sons to learning English. In this way he might become an interpreter and have a more advantageous position to enter the business and diplomatic world. I am wondering if that influenced my parents to put me into Mrs. Gutzlaff's School. As to what other _ it has eventually brought about in my later life, they were entirely left in the hands of God."

      "Silence is unnatural to man. He begins life with a cry and ends it in stillness. In between he does all he can to make a noise in the world, and he fears silence more than anything else. Even his conversation is an attempt to prevent a fearful silence. If he is introduced to another person, and a number of pauses occur in the conversation, he regards himself as a failure, a worthless person, and is full of envy  of the emptiest- headed chatterbox . He knows that ninety-nine percent of human conversation means no more than  _ , but he is anxious to join in the buzz and to prove that he is a man and not a waxwork figure .\nThe aim of conversation is not, for the most part, to communicate ideas; it is to keep up the buzzing sound. There are, it must be admitted, different qualities of buzz; there is even a buzz that is as annoying as the continuous noise made by a mosquito ? But at a dinner party one would rather be a mosquito than a quiet person. Most buzzing, fortunately, is pleasant to the ear, and some of it is pleasant even to the mind. He would be a foolish man if he waited until he had a wise thought to take part in the buzzing with his neighbors.\nThose who hate to pick up the weather as a conversational opening seem to me not to know the reason why human beings wish to talk. Very few human beings join in a conversation in the hope of learning anything new. Some of them are satisfied if they are only allowed to go on making a noise into other people's ears, though they have nothing to tell them except that they have seen two or three new plays or that they had food in a Swiss hotel. At the end of an evening during which they have said nothing meaningful for a long time, they just prove  themselves to be successful conservationists."

      "Among the Boys is a unique after-school program for boys living in the Highland Park neighborhood of our city. The organizational task is to provide males living in low-income and public housing with opportunities to discover their ability to change challenges into possibilities. The program includes an academic part as well as specific plans for supporting the overall development of the participants. Among the Boys uses painting as an instrument for helping boys examine their world, discuss it, and develop positive ways of handling the challenges they face daily. Young men present personal challenges to the group, such as a recent fight or the long-term drug abuse they observe in their neighborhood. After guided discussion, the youth work as a team, determining how to best represent the issue at hand in a painting. The resulting paintings and explanations of these paintings provided by the young people suggest that something profound  occurs through this process. These young men are learning a healthy way to express and cope with the pain and suffering they feel. Art serves as a healing process and a structured method of teaching teamwork, nonviolent values, conflict handling and problem-solving skills.\nActivities in Among the Boys are in agreement with the best practices in the prevention of high-risk behavior. First, community-based youth development programs are considered important parts of a comprehensive prevention method, particularly in high-risk neighborhoods. Second, compensatory  education that targets at risk youth for academic failure is also considered an effective prevention method. Third, interventions  aimed at improving youth's moral reasoning, social problem-solving, and thinking skills are reported to be effective methods for reducing violence in high-risk populations, especially when carried out with elementary school-aged boys. Finally, Among the Boys has an adapted tutoring part, considered an effective prevention tool. Tutoring is typically a one-to-one match between a tutor and a youth, but Among the Boys employs what is referred to as \"group tutoring.\" Among the Boys makes up for its high student-tutor ratio  with quality and quantity of time, as the program meets after school, on Saturdays, and all day during the summer, and is staffed primarily by males, an unusual quality among educational programs.\nAmong the Boys is rare and successful form of grassroots program, and represents the dream of a successful male who grew up in the Highland Park neighborhood and has returned to make a valuable contribution to his community."

      "Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March, 1853---29 July, 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist artist. He is considered one of the greatest artists with great influence on the greatest artists with great influence on the 20th-century art.\nVan Gogh spent his early adult life working for a firm of art dealers. After a brief period as a teacher, he became a missionary   in a very poor mining region. He did not begin his career as an artist until 1880; however, during the last ten years of his life, he produced more than 2,000 pieces, including around 900 paintings and 1,100 drawing and sketches  . He worked only with _ colours until he met Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism in Paris. Van Gogh used their bright colours and style of painting in a uniquely recognizable style. Most of his best-known works were produced during his final two years, when he was suffering from serious mental illness.\nIn 1890, at the age of 37, van Gogh shot himself in the chest. He died two days later, with Theo, his brother and his best friend, at his side, who reported his last words as \"The sadness will last forever\". It would not take long before his fame grew higher and higher.\nVan Gogh's mother threw away quite a number of his paintings. The only painting he sold during his lifetime, The Red Vineyard, was created in 1888. It is now on display in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, Russia. Several paintings by van Gogh rank among the most expensive paintings in the world. On March 30, 1987 van Gogh's painting Irises was sold for a record of $53.9 million at Southby's, New York. On May 15, 1990 his Portrait of Doctor Gachet was sold for $83.5 million at Christie's, thus setting a new price record."

      "New Zealand fishermen caught what may prove to be a world-record-breaking colossal squid  .\nIn the cold, dark waters of the Antarctic hides a creature with eight arms, two super long tentacles   and eyes as big as dinner plates. Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.\nOn February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\""

      "As the Labor Day public holiday starts this year, Chinese travel agencies have a new right: to blacklist poorly-behaved tourists in an effort to prevent ill manners. Tourists will be blacklisted for uncivilized behaviors such as acting antisocially on public transport, damaging private or public property, disrespecting local customs, or _ historical exhibits. According to the regulations issued by the China National Tourism Administration (NTA), tour guides and leaders have the right to report on bad behaviors to the government. The new regulations mainly come from the growing concern about the ill manners of Chinese tourists abroad.\nIn 2015, more than 83 million Chinese people traveled overseas, up 18 percent from the year 2014, according to the China Tourism Academy. But even as they travel farther, the Chinese tourists continue to take bad habits with them. From damaging ancient Egyptian temples to letting children defecate in the middle of airports, Chinese tourists have earned a bad fame. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang even stressed the need for Chinese tourists to behave better while traveling overseas so as to protect China's image abroad.\nNow with the latest regulations, Chinese travelers should have no excuse for rude behavior. According to the guidelines issued by NTA, when using the restroom, Chinese tourists are asked not to forget to flush the toilet after using it.\nThe guidelines also remind tourists of not fighting with others when they want to take pictures at tourist attractions. When flying, the guidelines advise travelers not to take life vests away from airplanes. Chinese tourists are also encouraged to be respectful of local customs wherever they travel.\nYet, with a very short history of traveling overseas, it is not surprising that many Chinese tourists behave badly on their foreign trips. We should give them time to change."

      "An ichthyologist is a scientist who studies fish. Most people who do this job say they love their work because it is very rewarding and varied. They work not only inside a laboratory, but also out in the field. Fieldwork includes traveling to rivers, oceans and lakes in order to collect information and specimens. Reading, writing and speaking are also very important to the job. Fish scientists need to read the research of other scientists. They must be able to write up their own research clearly so that others can follow it. They also need to be able to give lectures about their findings, so that they can spread knowledge.\nIchthyologists who wish to specialize can choose any one of three areas of study. The first area is aquaculture. This involves the study and practice of fish farming and management. Because it is a rather new study, there are very few job opportunities available. However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own. You also need to be able to handle equipment and perform experiments; but most importantly, you must love fish. To become an ichthyologist, you will need to train at a university to pass a Bachelor of Science degree. For this, you will need to be good at mathematics, physical science and biology. Then, you will need to study for another year to complete an honors degree in ichthyology. This honors degree contains coursework about all aspects of fish.

      "The twenty-four horses dash around a racetrack. The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.\nThe horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.\nPreparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.\nAustralia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.\nEach racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.\nThe first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.\nThe Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class. They come dressed in their finest to enjoy the event in comfort.\nBut anyway it's all about the race--the effort of horses and riders, the suspense and the thrill of victory."

      "Speaking two languages rather than just one has obvious practical benefits in an increasingly globalized world.But in recent years, scientists have begun to show that the advantages of bilingualism   are even more important than being able to converse with a wider range of people.Being bilingual, it turns out, makes you smarter.It can have a deep effect on your brain, improving skills not related to language and even protecting against a serious mental disorder in old age.\nThis view of bilingualism is different from the understanding of bilingualism through much of the 20th century.Researchers, educators and policy makers long considered a second language to be an interruption that prevented a child's school work and ability to think and understand things.They were not wrong about the interruption: there is ample evidence that in a bilingual \\s brain both language systems are active even when he is using only one language, thus creating situations in which one system disturbs the other.But this interruption, researchers are finding out, isn't so much a disturbance.It forces the brain to solve inside conflict, giving the mind a workout that strengthens its thinking muscles.\nThe key difference between bilinguals and monolinguals may be more basic: a heightened ability to monitor the environment.\"Bilinguals have to _ languages quite often--you may talk to your father in one language and to your mother in another language,\" says Albert Costa, a researcher at the University of Pompea Fabra in Spain.\n\"It requires keeping track of changes around you in the same way that we monitor our surroundings when driving.\" In a study comparing German-Italian bilinguals with Italian monolinguals on monitoring tasks, Mr.Costa and his colleagues found that the bilingual subjects not only performed better, but they also did so with less activity in parts of the brain involved in monitoring, showing that they did better in it."

      "There are only about 1,000 Hawaiian monk seals  left and its population is going down 4% a year. Hawaiian monk seals are found in the northwest part of the Hawaiian Islands. They spend a lot of time at sea. They are able to dive 600 feet deep, and can stay under water for up to 20 minutes. Adults grow up to seven feet long, and weigh between 400 and 600 pounds. They can live as long as 30 years.\nThese seals are born on land. Every year, usually in May or June, females find sandy beaches and give birth to a single baby. The female seals avoid beaches where the water becomes deep very quickly because this lets sharks swim close to land and catch the seals.\nMothers stay with their babies for six weeks. During that entire time, they do not leave the beach even to eat. Instead, they live off fat that they have stored up over the previous year and feed their babies with fat-rich milk. After six weeks, mothers go back to the sea. The young have to live on their own.\nHuman disturbance  has been regarded as the important factor in the decrease of the monk seals. In fact, if human come too near a mother seal too often, she will go out to the sea. Unfortunately, this usually means death for the baby. It is now against the law for people to come within 100 yards of a seal on a beach.\nRecent research has shown that the decrease in the Hawaiian monk seal population is due to lack of survival of these seals at one of the most important breeding  beaches at French Frigate Shoals. Also, seals often get trapped in fishermen and by changes in weather patterns. If these threats  were not enough, during the breeding season, males will attack females until they are badly injured or finally killed."

      "I've often had difficulty remembering names. Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.\nFive or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?\nI easily remembered his surname, \"Ricca\". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn't have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One's name is important to every person's identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance's name is similar to forgetting your wife's favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.\nI quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil.\n\"Bill, how are you doing?\", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.\nI was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons \"Bill\". \"Billerica\" was the name of a town just north of Boston."

      "Stores, farmer markets, gas stations and restaurants have been interested in the organic  food. However, it can be difficult to tell natural foods from organic foods. Most people don't know that there is a major difference between the two foods. No one seems to be able to determine which is which, creating a lot of confusion for people who are truly concerned with buying the best and healthiest products.\nIn 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its official position on organic foods and made its production controlled by a strict law. While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods. The most important thing to remember is to eat a variety of healthy foods, organic or natural foods. Eating more fruits, vegetables, low-fat and whole grains will be good for our health."

      "Do you think that day dreaming is a waste of time? Probably so.\n\"On the contrary.\" says L. Giambra. an expert in psychology  .\"Daydreaming is quite necessary. Without it, the mind couldn't get done all the thinking it has to do during a normal day. You can't possibly do all your thinking with a consciousness  . Instead, your unconscious mind is working out problems all the time. Daydreaming then may be one way that the unconscious and conscious states of mind have silent dialogues.\"\nEarly psychology experts paid no attention to the importance of daydreams or even considered them harmful. In the past daydreaming was thought to be a cause of some mental illnesses. They did not have a better understanding of daydreams until the late 1980's. Eric Klinger, a professor of psychology, is the writer of the book DAYDREAMING. Klinger says. \"We know now that daydreaming is one of the main ways that we organize our lives, learn from our experiences, and plan for our futures... Daydreams really are a window on the things we fear and the things we long for in life.\"\nDaydreams are usually very simple and direct, quite unlike sleep dreams, which may be hard to understand. It's easier to gain a deep understanding of your life by paying close attention to your daydreams than by trying to examine your sleep dreams carefully. Daydreams help you recognize the difficult situations in our life and find out a possible way of dealing with them.\nDaydreams cannot be predicted. They move off in unexpected directions which may be creative and full of ideas. For many famous artists and scientists, daydreams were and are a main source of creative energy."

      "Green is an important color in nature. It is the color of grass and the leaves on trees. It is the color of most growing plants, too.\nSometimes, the word green means young, fresh and growing. Sometimes, it describes something that is not yet finished or plants that are not\nFor example, a greenhorn is someone who has no experience, who is new to a situation. In the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in war  . By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.\nAbout one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west. Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. The greenhorn didn't have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country.\nSomeone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. The expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds.\nA person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.\nThe Green Revolution   is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains. The new plants produced much larger crops. The Green Revolution was the result of hard work by agricultural   scientists who had green thumbs."

They had no time to play or to relax, but they never felt appreciated for the work they did.\nOne day two donkeys got bored. They wanted to live a comfortable life, So the donkeys went to see a wise old man. They told him their problem. The wise old man agreed that they worked too hard, and he wanted to help the donkeys.\" I have an idea,\" he said.\n\"What is your idea?\" asked the donkeys.\n\"I will paint you and no one will know you are donkeys\" said the man.\nThe man went off to find some paint and he returned in just a matter of minutes. He had two pots of paint. One pot was filled with white paint, and the other black paint.\nThe old man first painted them white, and then painted black stripes over the white paint. When he finished, the donkeys did not look at all like donkeys.\" You no longer look like donkeys\" the old man said.\" Everyone will be fooled. I will call you something else, zebras.\"\nThe zebras went to a field to eat grass. Now they did not have to work.\nSoon, other donkeys saw the zebras. They asked the zebras where they came from. When the zebras told the donkeys their secret, the donkeys all rushed to see the old man.\n\"Make us into zebras, too,\" they pleaded. So the wise old man painted more donkeys. As he did, more and more donkeys came.\nThe old man could not paint fast enough. Soon the donkeys became impatient. They began to kick about, and they knocked over the paint pots.\nThere was no more paint. The painted donkeys ran off to become zebras. The unpainted donkeys, because of their impatience, had to return to work.\nThis is why it is important to be patient."

      "We know that many animals do not stay in one place. Birds, fish and other animals move from one place to another at a certain time. They move for different reasons: most of them move to find food more easily, but others move to get away from places that are too crowded.\n     When cold weather comes, many birds move to warmer places to find food. Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed. The most famous migration  is probably the migration of the fish, which is called \"salmon\". This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water. There it spends its life. When it is old, it returns to its birthplace in fresh water. Then it gives birth and dies there. In northern Europe, there is a kind of mouse. They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded. They move down to the low land. Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside, and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea.\n     Recently, scientists have studied the migration of a kind of lobster . Every year, when the season of bad weather arrives, the lobster get into a long line and start to walk across the floor of the ocean. Nobody knows why they do this, and nobody knows where they go.\n     So, sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another, but at other times we don't.

      "For Senior 3 students, choosing which college to attend can be the most exciting and thrilling time in their entire school lives. This is also true for an American girl named Melanie in the film, College Road Trip, which was _ in theprefix = st1 /USon March 7.\nMelanie's dad, James Porter, is the chief of police for a Chicagosuburb. Incredibly security obsessed , he wants Melanie to attend nearby Northwestern University, where she's already been accepted. But Melanie, 17, really wants to go to Georgetown in Washington,D.C., where she's been wait-listed.\nWhen she gets an unexpected interview, she decides to take a road trip with a few close female friends. Melanie believes it is her first step toward adulthood. \nBut despite the fact that this trip is \"girls only\", James isn't comfortable with the prospect of his little princess exploring the world without him. He wants to protect her. \nJames joins the girls and hopes he can convince her to go to Northwestern. While Melanie's father only has the best of intentions, his presence leads to an endless series of comic encounters. \nAfter following their faulty GPS device deep into the backwoods, James and Melanie discover her little brother and his pet pig have been hiding in the spare tire compartment . What should be a simple tire change results in the expensive car rolling down a mountain, forcing them to hike to a nearby hotel. There the pig ruins an outdoor wedding reception after eating an entire bag of coffee beans. \nAll these disasters add spice to their trip while along the way a father and a daughter finally get the chance to really talk to each other. \nThe film explores the parent-child relationship in a comic way: The discrepancy  between how close James thinks he is to Melanie and how little he actually knows of her plans makes us laugh first and then think.  \nAll parents, whether they have college students or not, can relate to the bittersweet realization that their kids are growing up. Like what Melanie and James have done in the film, we all can find the delicate balance between staying connected and letting go."

      "The Arctic will soon be free from ice, experts say. The change is bound to take place, but the global warming and climate change are changing the earth's landscape   rapidly,causing panic worldwide.\nExperts say that the Arctic sea ice is melting   quite faster than expected and it can affect not just the region, but Earth in general. A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape."

      "WHAT'S the most important thing of life?\nPeople's answers vary greatly. For British scientist Robert Edwards,the answer is having a child.\"Nothing is more special than a child,\"he told the BBC.\nEdwards,the inventor of the In Vitro Fertilization(IVF)technology--more commonly known as\"testtube baby\"technology--passed away on April 10 ,2013 at the age of 87.\nEdwards changed the lives of millions of ordinary people who now rejoice in the gift of their own child,\"said Peter Braude,professor at King's College London.\"He leaves the world a much better place.\"\nEdwards started his experiments as early as the 1950s,when he had just finished his PhD in genetics. At that time,much of the public viewed test-tube babies as\"scary\",according to Mark Sauer,professor at Columbia University,US.\nEdwards and his colleague Patrick Steptoe faced _ from churches,governments and media,not to mention attacks from many of their fellow scientists.\"People said that we should not play God and we should not interfere with nature,\"Edwards once told Times. He said that he felt \"quite alone\" at the time.\n\"But Edwards was a fighter,and he believed in what he was doing,\"said Sauer. Without support from the government,the two struggled to raise funds to carry on. And in 1968 they finally developed a method to successfully fertilize human eggs outside the body.\nThe first test-tube baby was born on July 25,1978.Her name was Louise Brown. Despite people's safety concerns,Brown was just as healthy as other children.\n\"IVF had moved from vision to reality and a new era in medicine had begun,\"BBC commented.\nEver since then,public opinion has evolved considerably. Couples who were unable to have babies began thronging to Edwards' clinic. Nowadays,Reuters reports,some 4.3 million other\"test-tube\" children exist. Edwards received a Nobel Prize in 2010 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II the following year.\nBefore his death,Edwards was still in touch with Louise.\"He is like a granddad to me,\"she said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\nHe is a granddad to millions, in fact."

Here are just a few famous mythical cities.\nEl Dorado.\nEl Dorado is a story that began in 1537, when Spanish explorers found the Muisca people in the mountains of what is now Colombia. They heard the story of a man who covered himself with gold and dived into a lake. Then people began to talk of El Dorado -'the golden man'Soon people started to think of El Dorado as a place, too a city of gold and amazing riches. Nowadays, the name 'El Dorado' is still used to mean'a place where you can get rich quickly.'\nAtlantis\nThere was once an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It was the mythical island of Atlantis. The people of the island were very rich, thanks to the natural resources on their island. For hundreds of years, they lived simple lives. But slowly they began to change. They started to want power. So the gods decided to destroy Atlantis. Suddenly, the island and its people were swallowed by the sea and were never seen again.\nShambhala\nIn Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Shambhala is a mystical  country that is hidden somewhere behind the Himalayas. Shambhala is a word from an old language that means'place of peace'or'place of happiness'. It is said that there is no war in Shambhala, and in the future , when the world is full of war, a huge army will come out of Shambhala, destroy the world's bad rulers, and start a new Golden Age. Some people say this will happen in 2424."

      "Global warming happens when greenhouse gases trap heat and light from the sun in the earths atmosphere, which increases the temperature. This is like when heat is trapped in a car. On a hot day, the car gets hotter when it is out in the parking lot. This is because the heat and light from the sun can get into the car, by going through the windows,but it can't get back out. This is what the greenhouse effect does to the earth .The heat and light can get through the atmosphere, but it can't get out. As a result,the temperature rises.\nSometimes the temperature can change in a way that helps us. The greenhouse effect makes the earth appropriate for people to live on. Without _ ,the earth would be freezing,or it would be burning hot. It would be freezing at night because we would not get the sun's heat and light .During the day, especially during the summer, it would be burning because the sun would be up with no atmosphere to filter it,so people,plants,and animals would be exposed to all the light and heat.\nAlthough the greenhouse effect makes the earth able to have people living on it,if there gets to be too many gases,the each can get unusually warmer, and many plants,animals.and people will die. Plants would die because they would not be able to take the heat .This would cause us to have less food to eat,and it would also limit the food that animals have. With less food for the animals that we need to survive we would even have less food. Gradually,people,plants,and animals would all die of hunger.\nPeople are doing many things to try to stop global warming .One thing is carpooling--driving with someone to a place that you are both going to. Another thing is being more careful about leaving electrical devices turned on. Now,more people are even riding buses or bikes to lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air .Although adults do many things to help stop global warming,kids call do just as much."

While she was driving on a road, a big truck hit its head on a pickup car. The pickup car burst into flames. Kristy rushed out and ran to the pickup. Two farmers, Dean Berhard, 51, and his brother Donald, 44, were inside.\nWhen she got close, Kristy could see the unconscious driver. The other man was under the passenger seat. Kristy says, \"The smells were sickening. I was afraid the truck would blow up and kill us all.\"\nThe driver of the big truck was struggling to open the passenger door, so Kristy rushed to the driver's side. Finally they opened the door. She reached in, seized the driver and , to her horror, felt her hands sink into his chest. She quickly dragged the man to safety on the roadside, then hurried back. As Kristy stared down the ditch   with the passenger, the pickup blew up. She jumped on top of him and they both rolled to safety.\nWhen the police arrived a while later, Kristy started crying, \"I want my mum.\" In fact she cried for the next three months.\nToday the two farmers, each the father of two children, are good friends with Kristy.

      "When hunting for a job in a weak economy, every detail counts. It's no longer good enough to be a qualified applicant, so job clubs can be of much help. \nWhat is a Job Club?  Job connection clubs are small groups of people across prefix = st1 /Americawho meet regularly to talk about job searching and career. These clubs support the success of all members. Looking for work chances is made easier when you're not alone. Job clubs are rooted in the belief that each member has something valuable to contribute and that everyone will benefit from the advice and encouragement.http://www.ks5u.com/\nWhy start or join a job club?  Job searching can possibly be a lonely and discouraging process, but it doesn't have to be that way. Becoming part of a local job club can offer valuable help. It may also bring a strong sense of confidence that gets you going in the right direction. When you know that your fellow members expect to hear regularly about your progress, you're more likely to have a positive attitude towards the club meeting. To support your success, the club will provide practical suggestions, including specific   discussion topics to get you started and keep you encouraged along the way of overcoming the difficulties in a job hunt. \nWhat are the topics of a job club?  While the form of club activities may be the same, the varied topics of discussion mean that no two meetings are exactly alike. You'll deal with a number of matters -- where to find proper job directions and how to get your calls returned; preparing for interviews; effectively applying for the right opportunities to satisfy your desire;  _ bravely and turning failure into success.\nEach member will update the group on his or her progress, and you'll end each meeting with a suggestion from each member to carry out specific tasks during the week that follows. There's no shortage of topics to talk about."

      "Scientists have long understood the key role that oceans play in controlling the Earth's climate. Oceans cover 70 per cent of the surface of the globe and store a thousand times more heat than the atmosphere does. What's newer is the understanding of how this key component  of our climate system responds to global warming.\nA brake on global warming--for now\nOne of the oceans' most important climate functions is absorbing heat and carbon dioxide(CO2), one of the gases that causes global warming. Acting as something absorbing heat, the oceans have absorbed huge amounts of heat and CO2 in the last forty years.\nFujita explains, \"the oceans are saving us from faster climate change--they are putting a brake on the climate system.\"\n\"That's the good news,\" he adds. \"The bad news is that the oceans only slow the atmospheric warming. Once the oceans come to balance with a greenhouse-gas warmed earth, the extreme heat will remain in the atmosphere and things will get much hotter.\" But where and how the oceans release this slowly increased heat is uncertain. And as the ocean stores heat, fragile  underwater ecosystems are struggling.\nThe most recent scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) also notes with concern that the ocean is acidifying  because of increased absorption of atmospheric CO2. and thus causing a threat to shell-forming species.  Sharp increase in CO2 levels will cause further acidification of the ocean.\nCurrents distributing heat\nAnother important role the oceans play is that of distributor . Oceans deliver heat and life-sustaining nutrition around the globe. Just as blood tube bring oxygen and nutrition to cells in the human body, the ocean's currents carry oxygen, nutrients and heat throughout the Earth. The ocean distributes 25 to 50 per cent of energy the planet receives from the sun. For example, the Gulf Stream carries heat across the Atlantic. This warm current gives northwestern European a milder climate that it would normally have so far north. A change to the ocean's circulation patterns could throw Europe into a colder period, even as the rest of the world is experiencing warmer temperatures."

      "Accepting and understanding other cultures is something that everyone needs to learn. Think of the world as a giant pizza. Without all the different vegetables, cheeses and meats, all you get is a tasteless pizza crust  . But when you put them all together, you get something very interesting, tasty, and good. So let's break down the walls between cultures.\nOne way to help break down the walls between us is to understand that many of our ancestors may come from the same place. Do you know what cultures you are from? Are you part Irish or mostly German? Did your grandparents or great-grandparents immigrate   to your country? \nThere is really no way to be completely sure where your first ancestors came from, but some scientists think that all people came from Africa. So how did they get all over the world? Well, back then there was a land bridge connecting Asia and North America, so they walked to Asia, Europe, and the Americas! Over time, the land bridge split up, and there was no way for people like Columbus to know that the Americas existed. Isn't it cool thinking that maybe we're all from the same continent? Even though we all came from the same place, now there are differences in the way we look depending on where our recent ancestors came from and who our parents are. If you find out where your parents and grandparents came from, you just might discover that you are from the same culture that you might be trying to avoid!"

      "The 4G mobile phones have been made available for some time and are now on hot sale. Quite a few customers are attracted by the much quicker access to the Internet and some new fancy features or functions and some people just want to keep pace with fashion.\nBy today's standards, my mobile phone is pretty rubbish. It's a Nokia 1616. If that doesn't mean much to you (it's not the kind of phone you see advertised on television), all you need to know is that it's a small, not very heavy device with which you can send and receive telephone calls and text messages. It also has a very handy flashlight on the top for when you can't find your keys, or when you drop something on the floor in the cinema. Other than that, my phone doesn't do much. Well, it has an alarm, and it probably has a calculator and things like that, but it's nothing compared to a smartphone. Why would I want one of those?\nI have often been told that the big advantage of having a smartphone is that \"you can do everything with them!\" But when was the last time you saw someone doing \"everything\" with a smartphone? Okay, so they may have an endless list of functions, but generally they are used for checking social networking sites, playing games, and receiving and replying to emails. I'm happy just doing all of those things at home on my laptop.\nAs far as I can tell, the best thing about having a smartphone is that you can be connected to the internet all the time. Don't get me wrong. I love the internet, but I just don't see the point of constantly being online. I can't remember the last time I received a Facebook update which was so urgent that I had to read it as soon as it appeared, and I can't imagine ever having a job which was so important that I would need to read work-related emails immediately. I would think that if someone needed me urgently, they would just ring me rather than send an email. And my trusty Nokia can manage that.\nOne of the most peculiar effects of the smartphone is, in my opinion, the newly-found addiction to maps and navigation   systems. Is there anything more boring than knowing exactly where you are all of the time? How do you get to know an area if you don't get lost there a few times? And if you are dependant on online maps, what happens to those great places you find just by chance? You can't exactly find out from Google maps the journey from\"here\"to \"that hidden cafe with the tasty-looking cakes\", or to \"that pond next to the church which looks really pretty in the evening sun. \" It is, of course, true that we all occasionally need to be pointed in the right direction, but I find that there are often real life humans you can ask.\nThere are many benefits of having a very basic mobile phone, like the fact that it cost me about twenty pounds, and that I don't have to worry too much about it being stolen. But the main benefit has to be the fact that it provides me with the word \"greatest excuse for my bad habits\". Whether it's turning up late to events, or getting lost on a trip, or missing buses or trains, or forgetting about an appointment at work, I'm pretty sure I'm covered with the following explanation \"I'm really, sorry I don't have a smartphone.\""

      "Anyone who has experienced the joy of driving through a rainstorm with the sunroof   open understands how airflow around the moving vehicles can keep him dry despite the exposure. Now a similar principle is being employed to create an umbrella that protects people from the rain using nothing more than an invisible air force field.\nAir Umbrella, developed by a Chinese company and recently funded by Kickstarter, uses forced air rather than fabric to create a protective canopy that keeps people from getting wet in the rain.\nIt's a clever concept and designers have done a good job of answering several questions about the product. For instance, the sound generated by the device is minimal, especially when compared to the pitter-patter of the falling rain. It can create a protective canopy wide enough for two people to fit under and it performs well even in the heavy rain. The air shield   can be cut through by high winds, but given that regular umbrellas typically fold over in similar windy conditions, the air umbrella is still an upgrade.\nA few concerns do remain, however. For instance, the battery life is only about 15-30 minutes depending on the model, so you'll still want to walk briskly to your next destination when it's raining. Also, while the air shield might keep the rain away from you, it's likely to splash all that blown-away water onto anyone else like a sprinkler  . So the device might draw the _ of anyone else walking with you, or any helpless bystanders.\nThere are currently three different types to choose from if you're interested in investing. Air Umbrella-A is the lightest model, and is apparently designed specifically for females, according to the Chinese developers. It is about 12 inches in length and weighs a little over a pound, and it runs for 15 minutes per charge. Air Umbrella-B measures nearly 20 inches long and weighs 1.7 pounds, and lasts 30 minutes per charge. Finally, Air Umbrella-C also lasts 30 minutes, but is scalable between 20 and 32 inches depending on your needs."

My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, \"What are all the flags doing here?\" He said, \"We are having the Olympic Games. That's where they honor the greatest athletes in the world.\" I said, \"Papa, someday I'm going to be an Olympic champ.\"\nWalking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, \"I've waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?\" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.\nDAVID BOND, 90, BRITAIN\nGOLD, SAILING\nDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.\nOur team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.\nWinning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.\nMICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAIN\nSILVER, ROWING\nI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.\nIn 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.\nOn the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.\nTHOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAIN\nBRONZE, CYCLING\nAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling. When the war broke out, I volunteered but was held back, so I continued riding.\nAfter my team won our bronze medals, we went home just round the corner and had a sit-down and a chat and a laugh. It was a different world. Money was never, never thought about."

Entries will be accepted until November 20.\nThe organizers have also _ a humorous campaign logo with objects and people associated with Sweden and Switzerland on separate maps of each country.  Sweden's map features meatballs, a Viking, as well as two male cartoon figures with a heart between them symbolizing gay marriage, which remains illegal in Switzerland.  Switzerland's map features cheese, the Alps and a picture of Roger Federer.\nChina may not be the only country struggling to tell Sweden and Switzerland apart.  Residents of Spanish-speaking countries also fall victim to the confusion as Sweden is spelt \"Suecia\" in Spanish while Switzerland is called \"Suiza\".\nSweden and Switzerland aren't the only places that have caused confusion among people.  Last month, , a British holidaymaker hoped to explore the architecture of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but instead mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the tropical Caribbean island of Grenada following a confusing booking blunder.  Earlier this summer, two US holidaymakers were flown to the wrong continent after an airline confused two airport codes."

      "A learning style is a way of learning. The styles which are often talked about are the Audio , Visual, and Tactile   learning styles. Read about each of following learning styles to decide what your learning style is. \nAre you an Auditory Learner?\nAuditory learners learn best when information appears as sounds. Do you seem to learn best in classes where teachers speak more? Does listening to tapes help you learn better? Do you find yourself reading out loud or talking things out to gain a better understanding? If so, you are probably an auditory learner.\nAre you a Visual Learner? \nVisual learners learn best when information is presented as something such as a picture or a drawing. Do you do best in classes in which teachers do a lot of writing on the blackboard and make full use of the TV? Do you take written notes from your textbooks and in class? If so, you are probably a visual learner.\nAre you a Tactile Learner? \nTactile learners learn best in hands-on learning settings in which they can use something or play with it in order to learn about it. Do you learn better when you touch or handle things? Do you do well in lab classes? If so, you are probably a tactile learner.\nYour learning style is your strength. Go with it whenever you can.

      "Seeing a volcano erupt is a wonderful experience, and you can really feel the heat by climbing to the top of Pacaya for a close-up view. There are guided tours every day up this highly active volcano from Antigua, giving travelers a chance to see Mother Nature at her most powerful.\nPacaya is an easy drive from Antigua, a beautiful city with many colorful houses along its old streets that are turned into art-works during its Holy Week festival. No matter when you come to Antigua, you won't miss the Pacaya-tour companies.\nBut climbing Pacaya is no easy job. It is 2,560 meters high, and reaching the peak takes two to three hours of almost one-step-forward and two-step-back movements. As you climb, you hear the dull sounds of eruptions high above. Steaming, hot remains from recent eruptions begin to line the path as you are near the active peak: the McKenney Cone  . Just as though you were going to walk over to the edge of the cone, the road turns to the left and up to the relative safety of the old, inactive peak.\nMany tours are timed so that you arrive at the cone of the volcano in plenty of time for sunset and the full contrast between the erupting red lava and the darkening sky. On a good day the view from the peak is extremely exciting. The active mouth boils, sending red lava over its sides, and once in a while shoots hot streams up to 100 metres into the air."

      "Last year, I lived in Chile for half a year. I lived with a Chilean family and had the responsibilities of any Chilean teenager. I had good days and bad days I didn't understand.\nChuquicamata, my host community, is a mining camp. When I arrived there, I was scared. It was so different from what I was used to. There were lots of dogs in the streets, and there was no downtown, few smoothly paved streets, and little to do for entertainment. Rain was not seen very often, earthquakes and windstorms were frequent.\nI had studied Spanish for two and a half years and was always one of the best students in my class. But in my first week in Chile I was only able to communicate and needed one person to whom I could explain my shock. I couldn't speak the thoughts in my head and there were so many.\nMost exchange students experienced this like me. Culture shock presents itself in everything from increased aggression towards the people to lack of appetite . I was required to overcome all difficulties.\nAs time passed, everything changed. I began to forget words in English and to dream in Spanish and love Chilean food. I got used to not depending on expensive things for fun. Fun in Chuquicamata was being with people. And I took math, physics, chemistry, biology, Spanish, art, and philosophy.\nBut the sacrifices were nothing compared to the gain. I learned how to accept and to succeed in another culture. I now have a deeper understanding of both myself and others."

      "The question of what children learn, and how they should learn, is continually being debated and redebated. Nobody dares any longer to defend the old system, the learning of lessons parrot-fashion, the grammar-with-a-whip system, which was good enough for our grandparents. The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.\nWell, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? \"Education\" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.\nYou see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their \"modem methods\" on the long-suffering children. Since one \"modem method\" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school. Frequently the modem methods are so sophisticated that they fail to be understood by the teachers, let alone the children; even more often, the relaxed discipline so essential for the \" informal\" feelings the class must have, prevents all but a handful of children from learning anything."

      "A student walks into his first class and realizes he forgot all about the midterm exam. He knows he needs to bring his grades up, and getting a zero will make it nearly impossible. He quickly jots down some notes and shoves them under his lap hoping it will help him pass. Cheating is a major concern in all academic environments. Students are creating new and more outrageous  ways of cheating every day; some claim that certain accounts of cheating can be justified, but overall it can always be prevented.\nCheating has been around forever, and millions of ways to cheat have been fashioned. Copying homework and cheat sheets are some of the most basic ways students in all education levels have cheated. Some students think nothing about writing a few answers on their hand, in a gum wrapper, or boldly using a study guide to cheat. Desperate students have even gone as far as to steal the test or scan in bottle wrappers and put answers into the nutrition label. The internet has now become available in almost every location. Computers can be accessed at school, at home, and now even on cell phones. This opens a doorway for even more methods of cheating to be born.\nThere are countless opinions on whether or not cheating can be justified. The truth is this behavior will always be a matter of opinion with each scenario of cheating. Students often rationalize their cheating by claiming they forgot to look over the material or did not understand what the teacher or professor was saying. Some may counter these arguments by saying that the student could have set reminders or asked the teacher to explain the material before the day of the test. Some other reasons students believe cheating is justified are their heavy workloads and trying to find time for school, sports, friends, and family. This may be true in certain instances, however, all students have these problems, and it is unfair to the students refrain  from cheating when the student who is dishonest receives a better grade. The majority of students who think cheating is acceptable may believe the reason for this is that sometimes students are unaware they are cheating, there is not enough time given for assignments, or that the information is too much for the course.\nIt may be difficult to accomplish, but cheating can be prevented. Teachers and professors have tried many options to stop cheating. These options can range anywhere from simply spreading test-takers out in a room, to expelling  a student, which will most likely hindertheir plans of getting into another college. One simple way to fix the problem is to scold the student when caught. They may be so scared or embarrassed that they never do it again. This is a risky way to prevent cheating in some cases, however, because it can possibly damage self-esteem. Another simple way to avoid cheating is to create many different kinds of the same test. This prohibits students from getting the answers off of a neighbor's test, but students still have the option of using other cheating tactics.\nThere may be a million ways to cheat and get away with it, but there are few times, if any, that it is justified. Cheating never has to be a necessity and is never worth compromising morals and losing years worth of working towards a degree. This problem is spreading throughout America; with everyone's help, it can be stopped."

      "However important we may regard school life to be, there is always the fact that children spend more time at home than in the classroom. Therefore, the teacher should realize that parents have a great influence on their children. Parents can become strong allies   of the school or they can get in the way of the school education.\nExperts have realized the need to keep parents informed of the newer methods used in schools. Many headmasters have conducted workshops explaining such matters as the reading readiness, program writing and mathematics to parents.\nMoreover, the classroom teacher, with the permission of the supervisors , can also play an important part in giving more knowledge to reporting pupils progress, teachers can help parents a lot in educating their children and parents can give much help to teachers.\nSuppose that a father has been drilling Junior arithmetic lessons night after night. In a friendly talk between the teacher and the father, the teacher can help the parent to make Junior interested in it. He might be persuaded to let Junior join in discussing the family budget, buying the food, using a ruler or measuring cup at home, setting the clock, calculating the distance of a trip and engaging in scores of other activities that have a mathematical basis.\nIf the father follows the advice, it is reasonable to say that he will soon realize that his son is making satisfactory progress in mathematics, and at the same time, enjoying the work.\nToo often, however, teachers' talks with parents are devoted to small accounts of children's misdemeanors . They talk about the laziness and poor work habits of the children.\nWhat is needed is a more creative way in which the teacher, as an adviser, plants ideas in parents' minds to make sure that the child spends the many hours out of the classroom learning something useful.\nIn this way the school and the home join forces in educating children."

      "Most earthquakes occur within the upper 15 miles of the earth's surface. But earthquakes can and do occur at all depths to about 460 miles. Their number decreases as the depth increases. At about 460 miles one earthquake occurs only every few years. Near the surface earthquakes may run as high as 100 in a month, but the yearly average does not vary much. In comparison with the total number of earthquakes each year, the number of disastrous earthquakes is very small.[JP]\nThe extent of the disaster in an earthquake depends on many factors. If you carefully build a toy house with an erect set, it will still stand no matter how much you shake the table. But if you build a toy house with a pack of cards, a slight shake of the table will make it fall. An earthquake in prefix = st1 /Agadir,Morocco, was not strong enough to be recorded on distant instruments, but it completely destroyed the city. Many stronger earthquakes have done comparatively little damage. If a building is well constructed and built on solid ground, it will resist an earthquake. Most deaths in earthquakes have been due to faulty building construction or poor building sites. A third and very serious factor is panic. When people rush out into narrow streets, more deaths will result.\nThe United Nations has played an important part in reducing the damage done by earthquakes. It has sent a team of experts to all countries known to be affected by earthquakes. Working with local geologists and engineers, the experts have studied the nature of the ground and the type of most practical building code for the local area. If followed, these suggestions will make disastrous earthquakes almost a thing of the past.\nThere is one type of earthquake disaster that little can be done about. This is the disaster caused by seismic sea waves, or tsunamis. (These are often called tidal waves, but the name is incorrect. They have nothing to do with tides.) \nIn certain areas, earthquakes take place beneath the sea. These submarine earthquakes sometimes give rise to seismic sea waves. The waves are not noticeable out at sea because of their long wave length. But when they roll into harbors, they pile up into walls of water 6 to 60 feet high. The Japanese call them \"tsunamis\", meaning \"harbor waves\", because they reach a sizable height only in harbors.\nTsunamis travel fairly slowly, at speeds up to 500 miles an hour. An adequate warning system is in use to warn all shores likely to be reached by the waves.\nBut this only enables people to leave the threatened shores for higher ground. There is no way to stop the oncoming wave."

      "There are about a billion bicycles in the world,twice as many as there are cars.But if Karl von Drais.the Baron of Sauerbronn(17851851) hadn't been such a lazy person,the bicycle may never have been invented at all.\n    Although he had a very important title (and was also a qualified and skillful engineer),the Baron was in fact a forest ranger,in other words,a gardener with responsibility for a very large garden.He was in charge of several hundred square kilometers of royal garden and forests in Central Germany.\n    In 1817.he invented a \"running machine\" that would help him get round the  _ more quickly.The machine was made of wood,and had two wheels,which were the same size.The machine had a wooden frame and a leather seat.The rider rode the machine like a horse,but with his feet on the ground.After running for a while,he could then take his feet off the ground and glide along.It was possible to change direction by controlling the front wheel.but there were no brakes! In 1863,a Frenchman called Pierre Lallement attached pedals to the front wheel of a bicycle,and the modern idea of a bicycle was born.\n    Every generation sees new designs and new interest in bicycles.Mountain bikes,for example,transformed the way people thought about cycling and introduced a new sport,which was accepted into the Olympics in 1996.\n    New materials such as titanium and carbon fiber are now used to build strong,lightweight machines and combined brake and gear systems have been developed.Englishman Chris Boardman astonished the world in the 1990s with his carbon fiber Lotus bicycle,winning Olympic gold in the 4,000 meters track pursuit in Barcelona.More recently,the Great Britain team took several medals at the Athens Olympics\n    For most people.however.the bicycle remains what it has always been-a pollution-free way of taking exercise and getting from A to B."

      "People around the world have their own ways of celebrating weddings. Now let's compare Eastern and Western weddings.\nChinese and Indian brides normally wear red dresses and most of the wedding decorations are of the same color. This is because the color red is said to bring good fortune. In many Eastern weddings, especially Chinese weddings, the bride will change into a different dress after the ceremony. White dresses only arrived in modern times because of the influence of Western wedding dress designs.\nWestern wedding dresses are different. Brides usually wear a wedding dress that is white in color and wear it throughout the whole wedding. Wearing white wedding dresses is said to have started in the 1840s, beginning with Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain. There are occasions when brides dress into more comfortable clothing so that they will be able to move more freely during the wedding reception.\nTraditional practices are strictly followed for most Western weddings. The couple follow up with any plans they have agreed and decided on to make their special wedding day unique and memorable. Wedding receptions and other celebrations differ among the East and the West, but the concept is still the same. They are held to show gratitude towards family members, friends and guests for being a part of the wedding ceremony.\nAnother common custom that weddings of the East and the West have is the wearing of the wedding veil . According to superstitious  beliefs, the bride wears a veil to protect her from being seen by evil spirits and the bridesmaids are decoys . This is still followed even today."

      "As a Chinese saying goes, \"Taste is actually a memory of childhood\". Local specialty food may not be popular among all people, but it offers outsiders a glimpse of local culture and history.\nGongcheng \"oil tea\" is such a kind of food that would be considered \"weird\" by many first-time visitors to the remote county in the north of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Many people dislike its bitter and astringent  flavor when they take a sip.\n\"It felt like drinking Chinese herbal medicine. I never expected that I would gradually accept it afterwards, and even become addicted to it,\" said a traveler surnamed Zhang who comes from Shijiazhuang in northern China's Hebei province.\nLangshan village is said to be the birthplace of Gongcheng \"oil tea\" whose ideal ingredients are green tea and fermented tea. The village has preserved well its buildings and roads dating back to late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), as well as its traditional way of making the special tea.\nLin Fengyou, 60, introduced the cooking process. She looks younger than her age, and attributes this to the benefits of drinking \"oil tea\" throughout the year.\nThe first procedure is to use a wooden hammer to pound the tea while heating it in an iron pot, and then add edible oil and boiled water afterwards. She filters off the solid residues , and pours the glue-like green tea soup into bowls. Then, she adds salt, caraway seed, green onion, dried rice, fried groundnuts, sliced taro and fried beans.\nThe taste of the \"oil tea\" is a mixture of the distinctive flavors of all its ingredients. Local people usually eat it together with glutinous rice  balls, rice dumplings and glutinous rice cake.\nThe villagers consume \"oil tea\" three times a day. The tea soup is a healthy and refreshing food. \"The tea soup to us is coffee to Westerners\", said Lin. \"But it is tastier.\""

      "People from East Asia tend to have more difficulty than those from Europe in distinguishing facial expressions--and a new report published online in Current Biology explains why.\nRachael Jack, University of Glasgow researcher, said that rather than scanning evenly across a face as Westerners do, Easterners fix their attention on the eyes.\n\"We show that Easterners and Westerners look at different face features to read facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Westerners look at the eyes and the mouth in equal measure, whereas Easterners favor the eyes and neglect the mouth.\"\nAccording to Jack and her colleagues, the discovery shows that human communication of emotion is more complex than previously believed. As a result, facial expressions that had been considered universally recognizable cannot be used to reliably convey emotion in cross-cultural situations.\nThe researchers studied cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions by recording the eye movements of 13 Western Whites and 13 East Asian people while they observed pictures of expressive faces and put them into categories: happy, sad, surprised, fearful, disgusted, angry, or neutral. They compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies.\nIt turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did. \"The cultural difference in eye movements that _ show is probably a reflection of cultural difference in facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Our data suggest that whereas Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion, Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less.\"\nIn short, the data show that facial expressions are not universal signals of human emotion. From here on, examining how cultural factors have diversified these basic social skills will help our understanding of human emotion. Otherwise, when it comes to communicating emotions across cultures, Easterners and Westerners will find themselves lost in translation."

      "A few years ago my sister moved from her home in Alabama to Buffalo, New York. Since moving to Buffalo she's become a big hockey fan and has encouraged me to start watching it. Unfortunately it's very difficult to find hockey on television here in Alabama. Since hockey games don't air very much on television I've had to look for different ways to watch hockey games.\nI often see websites that claim if you go to their website you can watch television on your computer. I try out many of these websites hoping that one of the television stations is a northern station that airs hockey games. Unfortunately, most of them don't work. Either the site doesn't really give you what they advertise or their video player doesn't work properly. But finally I've found one website that actually works.\nFree Tube is a site that you can go to and watch Television online for free. You don't have to download any kind of special software or pay money or even sign up for anything. All you have to do is go to Free Tube, choose your channel and start watching.\nThe different channels to choose from are separated into different categories like news, business, entertainment, music and sports. You're not going to find channels like NBC or ABC so you can watch the latest episode of Heroes or Grey's Anatomy but it does include some popular channels like Cartoon Network and ESPN.\nThere is also a movie section. Each movie channel airs different sorts of films like adventure, classics, comedy or horror and that channel will always air that kind of movies. The movie section also includes my favorite station called Maxx Trailers  . Maxx Trailers airs nothing but movies trailers 24 hours a day. Some of the trailers are for movies coming out and some are for movies that have already been released but already released movies don't go back farther than a couple of months.\nSo far I haven't had any problems with Free Tube's video player either. Whenever I choose a channel, the video almost always works and usually loads every quickly. The only problem I have with Free Tube is that there is currently a _ if you're using Firefox. Once you choose a channel you can't select another channel to change to, your web browser will freeze up. So if you're using Firefox, the only way to switch channels is to leave the site and re-enter the site, when choosing what channel you want to go to. However, Free Tube is aware of this glitch and is working with Mozilla to get it fixed right away.\nIf you're missing some show everyone is talking about like Grey's Anatomy or Heroes, this isn't really a solution for that. But Free Tube is a good way to find channels that you weren't aware of; there are several good stations to be found."

      "Charles Dickens is often thought of as one of the greatest British writers. February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday. Yet for many, his language is old-fashioned and his stories often improbable. So why do so many people know and read Dickens today?\nOne reason is the British government's insistence that every child studies a Dickens novel at school. Alongside William Shakespeare, Dickens is on every English literature school reading list.\nHis stories, though often long by today's standards, are great moral tales. They are filled with colorful characters.\nEarlier this month, a ceremony was held in Portsmouth, where Dickens was born. Prince Charles said at the ceremony, \"Dickens used his creative genius to campaign passionately for social justice... His characterization   is as fresh today as on the day it was written.\"\nHis books stand out from many other writers because of his insight into human nature. Dickens, like Shakespeare, tells us truths about human behavior. They are as true in the 21st century as they were to his readers in the 19th century.\nReaders have returned to Dickens' books again and again over the years to see what he has to say about their own times.\nNo surprise then that it was Dickens whom Britons turned to during the economic crisis in the last couple of years. Dickens helped them make sense of a world that was rapidly falling apart. The BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit, into a popular television drama that introduced many Brits to the novel for the first time. A dark story about greed and money, it was the perfect illustration of bad times.\nAs long as Dickens's novels have something to say to modern audiences, it seems likely that he will remain one of Britain's best-loved writers."

      "Listening, really listening, can improve communication and build respect with others. Communication begins by listening and then suggesting that you hear what the person is saying.\nThis can be recognized by focus or eye contact, body language, and reflective listening.\nFocus (Eye Contact)--Focus means that you are looking directly at the person speaking and not looking off to one side or continuing to do something else. You are focused on what is being said; the speaker is the center of attention. Listening attentively is essential for positive communication.\nListening Without Interrupting--Does your body acknowledge  that you are listening? Use smiles, nods, and expressions of understanding to communicate to the speaker that you are listening. It is not necessary that you agree or disagree at this time. It is more important for the person speaking to know that his or her words are respected. This strengthens communication.\nReflective Listening--Reflective listening involves hearing the feelings and meanings of the speaker. It is a re-statement (in different words) of what the speaker said. You, in essence, mirror the words of the speaker and rephrase them back to the speaker, checking for accuracy of understanding. This process affirms the speaker, indicates a respect of the person, and shows that you understand the speaker's message. Through careful reflection of the speaker's words, you can make clear the message and build mutual  understanding. Through reflective listening and the careful exchange of words, we learn that other people have important feelings and opinions which we need to consider. Learning to understand the importance of all ideas, not just our own, can lead to successful resolution of problems and mutual respect."

      "When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store , it often carries a label  telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Indeed, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to do away with labels entirely.\nHowever, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket , from a store , a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.\nThis label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of , the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be the truth.\nThe reason for this label is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying.

      "An estimated 80 percent of American adults think music lessons, though at times boring and challenging in the eyes of some kids, improve children's ability to learn or their performance in school . They say that the satisfaction for learning to play a new song helps a child express creativity.\nResearchers at Harvard University, however, have found that there's one thing musical training does not do. Samuel Mehr, the leading researcher of the new study, said it is wrong to think that learning to play a musical instrument improves a child's intellectual development. The evidence comes from studies that measured the mental ability of two groups of 4-year-olds and their parents. One group attended music class; the comparison group went to a class that places importance on the _ arts-arts that can be seen.\n\"We found no evidence for any advantage on any of these tests for the kids participating in these music classes,\" said Mehr.\nSamuel Mehr says researchers have carried out many studies in an effort to learn whether musical training can make children smarter. Only one study seems to show a small percentage increase in IQ, intellectual scores among students after one year of music lessons.\nHe does not believe that IQ is a good measure of a child's intelligence. Therefore, the researchers in his study compared how well children in the musical training group did on mental processing tasks, then the results were compared to those of children who did not take lessons.\nMusic lessons may not offer children a fast easy way to gain entry to the best schools later of their life, but the training is still important.\nMr Mehr notes that the works of writer William Shakespeare are not taught , so the children will do better in physics. He says Shakespeare is taught because it is important for cultural reasons.\"And I don't think music needs to be any different than that.\""

She is speaking Mandarin.\nEnglish is rarely heard in Lisa Yang's class at the Chinese American International School(CAIS), despite the fact that few students are native speakers of Mandarin.\nThe United States is actively trying to increase the group of students in \"critical languages\" such as Mandarin. The students at CAIS are way ahead in such a trend.\nFounded 25 years ago, this small private school in San Francisco, USA, does what few other American schools do: It produces fully fluent speakers of Mandarin Chinese, by far the most commonly spoken language in the world.\nMandarin Chinese is suddenly hot in American schools. As China becomes the world's leading economy sometimes this century, schools in the U. S. are _ to add Mandarin to their list of foreign languages or expand Chinese programs already in place.\n\"It really is almost unprecedented. People are looking at China as a force to be reckoned with... And to ensure that the U. S. has the ability to conduct trade, and to work with the Chinese. Certainly having an understanding of Chinese language and culture is an advantage,\" said Marty Abbott of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages(ACTFL).\nTo develop Chinese-language programs has not been smooth. A shortage of trained teachers has made it difficult for some schools to join the race. When schools do get teachers, they often hire them straight from China, and the teachers usually suffer culture shock when they come to the U. S.\nRobert Liu remembers his first two years in an American classroom It was not an easy adjustment. \"In China, students respect their teachers,\" he said. Liu found that American students, however, expect an active teaching style. He had to use games to engage them rather than lectures.\nTo avoid many of the problems with foreign teaching styles, the CAIS has been working with the Chinese government to improve training of teachers who are sent to the U. S."

      "CORVALIJS. Ore.-- Engineers at Oregon Suite University have made a breakthrough in the performance of microbial  fuel cells that can produce electricity directly from wastewater,opening the door to a future in which waste treatment plants not only will power themselves, but will sell extra electricity.\nThe new technology ,developed at OSU, can now produce 10 to 50 more times the electricity, per volume, than most oilier approaches using microbial fuel cells,and 100 times more electricity than some.\nResearchers say this could eventually change the way that wastewater is treated all over the world, replacing the widely used \"activated sludge   \" process that has been in use for almost a century. The new approach would produce significant amounts of electricity while effectively cleaning the wastewater,\n\"If this technology works on a commercial scale the way we believe it will ,the treatment of wastewater could be a huge energy producer, not a huge energy cost.\" said Hong Liu ,an associate professor in the OSU Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering. \"This could have an impact around the world, save a great deal of money, provide better water treatment and promote energy sustainability.\"\nThe biodegradable  characteristics of wastewater, if developed to their full potential, could theoretically provide many times the energy that is now being used to process them, with no additional greenhouse emissions.\nOSU researchers reported several years ago on the promise of this technology, but at that time the systems in use produced far less electrical power. With new concepts, the technology can now produce more than two kilowatts per cubic meter of liquid reactor volume.\nThe new system also works better than an alternative approach to creating electricity from wastewater, based on anacrobic  digestion that produces methane  .It treats the wastewater more effectively, and doesn't have any of the environmental drawbacks of that technology, such as production of possible release of methane, a significant greenhouse gas."

      "Speed-reading is an essential skill in the Internet age. We skim over articles, e-mails to try to grasp key words and the essential meaning of a certain text. Continuous information from our electronic devices, it would be impossible to cope if we read word by word, line by line. But a new trend calls on people to unplug and enjoy reading slowly, listing benefits beyond intellectual development.\nA recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smart phones. They sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour.\nSome of these benefits have been backed up by science. For example, a study of 300 elderly people published by the journal Neurology last year showed that regular engagement in intellectual activities like slow-reading slowed the rate of memory loss later in life.\nYet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the linear, left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information. The Internet may have made us stupider, says Patrick Kingsley from The Guardian.  \nSlow reading means a return to an uninterrupted, linear pattern, in a quiet environment free of distractions. Aim for 30 minutes a day, advises Kelly from The Atlantic. \"You can spend half an hour pretty easily if only during your free moments -- whenever you find yourself automatically firing up your laptop to check your favorite site, or scanning Twitter for something to pass the time-you pick up a meaningful work of literature.\""

It comes as world leaders are talking about fighting global warming in Copenhagen, Denmark. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are the main cause of global warming, which leads to extreme weather and other conditions.\nLiving a low carbon life means trying to cut carbon dioxide emissions  in one's daily life. For example, burning less coal and oil, which produce CO\n. It means walking, biking or taking buses, rather than using a private car.\n\"A(H1N1) flu\" is also on Xinhua's list. Since April, 2009 the virus has made over 100,000 people ill on the Chinese mainland and 325 people had died of it as of December 9. But as US magazine\npointed out recently, the best evidence suggests it is no more dangerous than a bad seasonal flu.\nThe year 2009 saw the growing impact of the Internet on society, with the word \"duomaomao\", meaning hide-and-seek, becoming a hit on the web. On February 12, Li Qiaoming died of brain injuries several days after being detained  by police in Jinning county, Yunnan Province. Police said it was an accident sustained while he was playing hide-and-seek with his fellow prisoners.\ncast doubt on this explanation and called for an investigation. It turned out that Li had been beaten to death by other prisoners.\nAnother phrase connected with the Internet on the list is \"Net Addiction Camps\". Many parents send children obsessed  with the web to \"Net Addiction Camps\" for treatment. But some camps use physical punishment or electrical shocks. In 2009, some young people died as a result of the extreme methods, which led to a nationwide discussion. In November, the Ministry of Health banned the use of physical punishment to keep children off the net and dropped the term \"net addiction \". It did not say that excessive  net use is a mental illness either."

      "When is the right time to get kids involved in teamwork and what does it mean to be part of a team? There are many great ways to introduce kids to team building. Use team building games and activities to get kids to understand the meaning of being in a team.\nTry to find some games that have kids work together on some kind of problem solving. Children naturally have a shorter attention span   than adults so present it in a funny way. Create a reward system for teams that are able to work together in order to reach a common goal. When they solve the problem and receive a reward, it gives them initiative to keep working hard and cooperating with others. The best games are those that require direct communication between team members.\nOrganize a game of 20 questions for the kids to play while building a team. Draw up a series of cards with different questions on each. Have each child select a card and then ask another question on it casually. It's a great way for the kids to share and discover common interests. Kids need to be entertained and social when in a large group. This will lighten the mood greatly and help the quieter team members to come out of their shells.\nHave the kids sit in a circle or around a table and share their favorite things. Start with something like movies or books and move on to anything from toys to animals. Sharing interests creates discussion. When you share interests with someone, it is easier to relate to them. Kids finally want to be friends with most other kids. Encouraging them to get along socially is always positive. By sharing interests they can form valuable bonds that will serve them as both individuals and as a team."

      "A study of English learning problems was carried out among a total of 106 foreign students. It shows that most students considered understanding spoken English to be their biggest problem on arrival. This was followed by speaking. Writing increased as a problem as students discovered difficulties in writing papers that they were now expected to hand in. Reading remained as a big problem.\nInformation gained helped us in determining where special attention should be paid in our course. Although many students have chosen to join the course with a reasonable motivation, we considered it important to note what seemed to encourage interest. Nearly all the students have experienced some kind of grammar-based English teaching in their own country. To use the same method would be self-defeating because it might reduce motivation, especially if it has failed in the past. Therefore a different method may help because it is different.\nVariety of activity was also seen as a way of maintaining or increasing motivation. Several years ago we had one timetable that operated throughout, but we soon found that both the students and the teachers lost interest about halfway through the ten weeks. This led us to a major re-think, so in the end we brought it into line with the expressed language needs of the students."

      "In today's world of cellphones, mini laptops and MP3 players, most people have at least one timetelling tool with them. Since these devices are so common, is time running out for the 500yearold watch? According to some consumers, yes. New Jersey teenager Charlie Wollman says a watch is \"an extra piece of equipment with no necessary function\". Many young adults agree -- and use their cellphones to tell time. Louis Galie, a senior vice president at Timex, said that fewer young people wear watches today than five years ago. As a result, some people claim that _ .\nHowever, watchmakers optimistically say that watches regain popularity when consumers reach their 20s and 30s. By then, they are willing to spend money on a quality timepiece that doesn't just keep good time. Fifty years ago, watchmakers boasted about their products' accuracy. But in recent years, the watch industry has transformed itself into an accessory business. And for many today, the image a watch communicates has become more important than the time it tells.\n\"Complications\" -- features that go beyond simple timekeeping -- are an important part of a watch's image. Today's watches offer a lot of features that suit almost any personality. These features include altitude trackers, compasses, lunar calendars, USB drives, and even devices that measure the effectiveness of golf swings!\nCreativity is also a key element in today's watches. For example, Japanese watchmaker Tokyoflash makes watches that don't even look like watches. The company's popular Shinshoku model uses different color lights to tell time.  It looks more like a futuristic   bracelet than a watch. Another Japanese watchmaker, EleeNo, makes a \"handless\" watch. Using a ring of circles to keep time, this watch makes an excellent conversation piece.\nWhether a watch communicates fashion sense, creative flair or a love of sports, consumers want their timepieces to stand out. Nowadays, everyone has the same kind of gadget   in their bags, so people want to make a statement with what's on their wrists.  Will this interest in wrist fashion last? Only time will tell!"

Not long ago, the information Highway was a new road, with not many users. Now, everyone seems to want to take a drive, with over 30 million families connected worldwide. Not surprisingly, this well-traveled highway is starting to look like a well-traveled highway. Traffic jams can cause many serious problems, forcing the system to close down for repair. Naturally, accidents will happen on such a crowed road, and usually victims are some files, gone forever. Then, of course, there's Mr. Cool, with his new broad-band connection, who speeds down the highway faster than most of us can go. But don't trick yourself; he pays for that speeding.\nPassage 2\nWant to know more about global warming and how you can help prevent it? Doctor Herman Friedman, who is considered a leading expert on the subject, will speak at Grayson Hall next Friday. Friedman studied environmental science at three well-known universities around the world before becoming a professor in the subject. He has also traveled around the world observing environmental concerns. The gradual bleaching   of the Grate Barrier Reef, which came into the public eye in 2002, in his latest interest.

      "After years of study, I have known there are only two types of people in this world: those who get to the airport early and those who arrive when the plane is about to take off.\nIf there were any justice in this world, early-airport people would be rewarded for doing the right thing. And late-airport people would be punished. But early-airport people getulcers , heart attacks and bite their fingernails to the bone. Late-airport people almost don't realize they are flying.\nA guy of that kind once said, \"Don't hurry. If you miss your flight, it's because God doesn't want you to go.\" This is clearly a guy who is never going to get an ulcer.\nEarly-airport people suffer another \"name\". They are called exactly what they are -wimps . I know. I was an early-airport person for years. \"My baggage will get on the plane first,\" I told myself. Indeed it would, which made it the last baggage they took off the plane after landing.\nAnother strange thing: No matter how early I showed up, I was always told that someone had called two or three years ahead of me and asked for the best seat. I thought it was a trick. I thought there was someone in America who called every airline every day and said: \"Is that wimp Simon flying somewhere today? If he is , give me his seat.\"\nAfter a lifetime arguing with my wife over whether I really have to pack 24 hours in advance and set the alarm clock four hours ahead, I have learned another fact about early-airport people and late -airport people:\nThey always marry each other."

      "Most city parks are places where you can escape from big,ugly structures of metal and stone.The Manhattan High Line is different.Raised 25 feet above the ground,this massive metal structure once supported a rail line.The line opened in 1934 but it was hardly used after the 1960s,and much of it was torn down.However,one stretch remained in a region of Manhattan.The railway structure was ugly and everyone knew that at some time,it would have to be removed.\nBut the High Line was not destroyed.In fact.now the old rail line serves as one of the most peaceful places in the city.The idea to change the rail line into a park came from Joshua David and Robert Hammond.In 1999,they attended a community meeting to decide the fate of the High Line.David and Hammond were the only people at the meeting interested in saving the historical structure. Later on,when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line,they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city,and they realized that the High Line had potential to become a park.There was growing interest in improving urban centers,and so the project quickly gathered funds for construction.\nThe first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike.Each part of the park has a different atmosphere.Some areas are like balconies with wonderful city views.Other sections have wide lawns and walkways planted with wild flowers.Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years--a railway line overgrown with weeds."

      "Need to relax after a few stressful months? Perhaps you need to go to a spa.\nFirst of all, what exactly is a spa? Traditionally, spas were places with a natural spring producing warm waters that could be used in hydrotherapy   treatments. They were places where you \"took the waters\" --- meaning you drank some of the water or bathed in it.\nBut nowadays, a \"spa\" can mean a variety of things. In general, the term is often used to refer to commercial establishment that provides many services for health, fitness, weight loss, beauty and relaxation. This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town. It was popular with the inventor Thomas Edison, the writer Johann Goethe, and many famous people and European emperors.\nToday, although taking the waters isn't as common as it used to be, spa treatments are more popular than ever."

      "When author Nicholas Carr began researching his book on whether the Internet is ruining our minds,he restricted his online access and email.His new book argues the latest technology _ us less capable of deep thinking.Carr found himself so distracted  that he couldn't work on the book while staying as connected.After first feeling confused by his sudden lack of online connection,he was able to stay focused on one task for a long period within several weeks.\nReading on the Internet has changed how we use our brains.Facing a lot of texts,video,music and links to other web pages and blogs,our minds have become used to skimming and scanning information.As a result,we have developed sharper skills at making fast decisions,particularly visual ones,Carr wrote.\nBut now most of us seldom read books or long articles that would help us focus.We are becoming more like librarians--able to find information quickly and see clearly the best nuggets .That lack of focus hinders  our longterm memory,leading many of us to feel distracted,he wrote.\n\"What we are losing is a whole other set of mental skills,which require not the shifting of our focus but the maintaining of our focus,\" Carr said,adding that for centuries books protected our brains from distraction and focused our minds on one topic at a time.\nBut with devices such as Apple's iPad becoming common,Carr predicts books also will change.\"New forms of reading always require new forms of writing,\" he said.Carr has a suggestion for those who feel web surfing has left them incapable of concentration--slow down,turn off the Internet and practice the skills of contemplation  and reflection.\"It is pretty clear from the brain science that if you don't exercise particular cognitive skills,you are going to lose them,\" he said.\"If you are constantly distracted,you are not going to think in the same way that you would think if you paid attention.\""

      "The Convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage appeared from a need to call for international cooperation to protect the world's natural and scenic areas and historic sites for present and the future generations.\nIn 1959 there was international concern over the flooding of the Abu Simbel temples, a treasure of ancient Egyptian civilization, to build the Aswan High Dam in Egypt. Through an international campaign by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) on the request of Egypt and Sudan, resources were found to move the temples to a new site. In 1965,a conference at the White House in Washington DC, USA called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" and international cooperation to protect \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future\". In 1969, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) developed similar proposals for its members .Therefore, the Convention was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972. By regarding heritage as both cultural and natural, the Convention reminds us of the ways in which people interact with nature , and of the basic need to keep the balance between the two.\nThe Convention identifies the natural or cultural sites on the World Heritage List, and sets out their role in protecting them .Although the emphasis has been on sites and natural features of \"outstanding universal value\", each country promises not only to _ the World Heritage sites situated in its country, but also to protect and conserve its cultural and natural heritage.\nThere is also a \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" which are sites threatened by serious and specific dangers caused by changes in the use or ownership of the land , wars or natural disasters."

And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.\nNot too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?\nI would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and if needed, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school, I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children's doctor. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children's clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife's income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.\nI want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. I want a wife who will keep my clothes cleaned, ironed, mended, replaced and who cooks the meals, does the necessary grocery shopping, prepares the meals, serves them pleasantly, and then does the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school.\nI want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house cleaned and prepare a special meal and serve it to me and my friends and will not interrupt when I talk about the things that interest me and my friends.\nIf, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life: My wife will take the children and be only responsible for them so that I am left free.\nWhen I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to stop working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife's duties.\nMy God, who wouldn't want a wife?"

You can see the country you are travelling in. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable.\nSome people prefer to travel by sea when it is possible. There are large lines and river boats with which you can visit many other countries and different places. Travelling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.\nMany people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish: where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or a hotel to spend the night.

      "A patient came to see me about the stress in her life. She described all the things she had to do -one was to make her bed-from the moment she woke up until she flew out of the door for work. I suggested she experiment by not making her bed for two weeks. She was shocked, probably thinking I'd been raised by wolves in a forest. However, she went along with my idea.\nTwo weeks later she went into my office beaming. She had left her bed unmade for the first time in 42 years-and nothing bad had happened. \"And you know what?\" she said. \"I don't dry my dishes anymore, either.\"\nThis woman had made two major breakthroughs  . One was discovering that she had choices in her life that she had never seen before. The other was giving herself permission to be less that perfect. This story shows an important principle   about managing time: No one can do it all. Each of us has to make choices and accept trade - offs. The problem is, many people choose in ways that put themselves and their health last. They take better care of their houses and cars than they do of themselves. They put everyone else's needs ahead of their own.\nSo what is the solution? There's an easy way. Decide what you want in your life, and put that first. On a daily basis, that should include regular meals, enough sleep and time with your family. Exercise, leisure, friendships and hobbies should also be regular aspects of life. The point is to do something for yourself every day. The choice is yours: whatever makes you feel good about yourself and your life. Take a nap. Take a walk. Take time to play the piano. Stop bringing your briefcase home from the office. Stop keeping your house as clean as your mother kept hers. Fill more of your time with want - to - dos instead of have - to - dos."

      "You have two eyes and they are set close together on the front of your face. Have you wondered why? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world.\nYour eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film. Similarly, when you look at something, each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball. Because your eyes are set close together, they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image.\nSeeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together, which is called stereoscopic sight. This allows you to view the world in three dimensions, or 3-D. Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it. If images are coming from only one eye, however, only two of these dimensions----height and width----can be _ . A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional, as in a photograph.\nNow consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face. Think of other animals with the same arrangement. They are all animals that hunt, like lions and wolves. Their eyes face directly in front of them. This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide, which is called binocular  sight. On the other hand, animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head, which provides nearly360-degree field of sight. In order to stay alive, they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind. However, without stereoscopic sight, they have difficulty determining how far a danger is.\nWith sight both stereoscopic and binocular, humans share with animal hunters the ability to see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance. If you think it would be great to have another type of sight, perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do, think again! Each tiny insect eye sees only a tiny part. Besides, what if you needed glasses? Be glad for the eyesight that you have."

      "Parties and social gatherings no longer excite us the same way they once did. This is not due to a lack of desire to socialize, but the smartphone.\nAt parties, more people are on their smartphones than on their drinks. According to a recent International Data Corporation study, well over half of all Americans have a smartphone and reach for it the moment they wake up, keeping it in hand all day. In addition, too much of society is using smartphones while driving and as a result getting into car crashes. 34 percent of teens admit to text while driving, and they confirm that text messaging is their number one driving interruption. People's attachment to their smartphones is unbelievably becoming more important than the lives of themselves and others.\nJust as drivers dismiss the importance of focusing while on the road, many people also fail to recognize the significance of human interaction. When with their friends, some people pointlessly check or send text messages in the presence of a friend, which sends a message to that friend: the person I am texting is more important than you. In addition, relying on our smartphone to make friends does not give us the same advantage as being able to make new friendships in the real world. Face-to-face conversations will give us much stronger communication skills in the long run.\nAs many people risk their lives and the lives of people around them just to send a text or mindlessly check their massages, smartphones are in many ways more dangerous to people. The quality of this technology is de-advancing societal achievements and weakening the value of communication. Not only is the smartphone affecting our desire to interact   face-to-face but it is also lowering society's ability to communicate."

      "Many deaths from home fires are the result of burns and panic, but most are caused by deadly smoke and gases. These fatal fires are often caused by such careless acts as throwing away a lighted match or cigarette, allowing rubbish to pile up, overloading electrical wires, or misuse of healing and cooking equipment.\nFew families go to bed at night without first checking to make sure that the doors and windows are locked, but they overlook a very basic fire safety rule. This rule states that people should sleep with their bedroom doors closed. Nighttime fires are most serious because the family is asleep and the discovery of fire is usually too late.\nA closed bedroom door gives extra protected by delaying the gases and fire, thus giving the family a few minutes to escape.\nAt the first sight of fire in a home, it is necessary for everyone to get out of the house, especially children and elderly persons who may need help. Not everyone flees quickly from a burning home. Children often panic and hide in closets or under beds. Being prepared or knowing what to do in case fire breaks out can mean the difference between life and death. All members of the family should know certain basic steps.\nEveryone should know an escape route and second route from each room in the house. Very young children and old persons should receive careful thought when mapping out family escape plans. Both groups will need special help in escaping from home fires. A family should determine a way in which any members can sound an alarm. It is likely that fire may block hallways and prevent a person from reaching other bedrooms : Family members should be taught not to waste time getting dressed or collecting valuable possessions. Speed is necessary in escaping from fire."

      "A white shark shipped from New York and placed into an outdoor pool for a Kmart commercial in Los Angeles died after showing signs of distress, an official from the animal welfare group that monitored the production said on Thursday.\nThe American Humane Association (AHA), which certifies film and TV productions with animals, says everything possible was done to ensure the 1.5 meter shark's safety.\nThe shark's death follows lots of criticism of the use of animals in Hollywood productions. The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which said it received details on the shark's death from two whistleblowers\n , criticized the AHA in a letter over the shark's death.\n\"Sharks are sensitive animals who, in captivity , require a highly specialized and controlled environment,\" the PETA letter read. \"Given the delicate nature of this species, why would the AHA approve the transport and use of this animal?\"\nThe shark was placed into a 227- liter outdoor tank in the Van Nuys suburb of Los Angeles, said Karen Rosa, a senior adviser of the AHA. She added that was a good amount of water for it. \"We honestly don't know why the animal died. It was not being mistreated. It was not being harmed,\" Rosa said.\nEarly in the day, the shark seemed to be in good condition, but at one point they noticed it showed signs of distress. \"As far as I know, it was immediately insisted upon that the animal receive specialized aquatic veterinarian  care,\" she said.\nOxygen was pumped into the tank and the shark was given a shot to try to stabilize it before it was transferred to an aquatic compound for care, where it died the same day, Rosa said.\nThe shoot was for a Kmart commercial, but a representative for the retailer could not disclose any details.\n\"We take this matter seriously and safety is always our first concern,\" the spokesman for Kmart said in a statement."

      "The sound of a mosquito can mean trouble in many parts of the world. The bite of the mosquito can be deadly. The insects carry serious diseases like malaria  . It is estimated that almost 630,000 people died from malaria and malariarelated causes in 2012, and most of these cases were in African countries.\nIn the United States, a group of California scientists are working to develop a more effective and less costly substance   to protect people from mosquitoes. The researchers are investigating the sense of smell in mosquitoes. They found the insects use the same _ for identifying carbon dioxide in human breath as they do for the smell of our skin. Anandasankar Ray, who is leading the investigation, says scientists tested more than a million chemical compounds   until they found a substance called Ethyl Pyruvate. He says Ethyl Pyruvate makes the mosquitoes' receptors inactive. \"When we apply Ethyl Pyruvate to a human arm and offer it to hungry mosquitoes in a cage, very few of the mosquitoes are attracted to the human arm because only a few of them are able to smell it out,\" said Ray.\nGenevieve Tauxe, a member of the research team, says it was not easy to find the neurons   of noble cells that recognize both the smell of human breath and skin. \"With the device used to examine the mosquito, we are able to insert a very small electrode   into the part of the mosquito's nose, where its smelling neurons are and where the smell is happening,\" said Tauxe.\nAnandasankar Ray says a product based on Ethyl Pyruvate may cost less to produce than DEFT, the most effective chemical treatment now in use. He says DEFT is too costly for most people who live in areas affected by malaria.\n\"Perhaps by finding smells that can attack other target receptors, we will be able to improve upon DEFT and finally have the next generation of insect behaviour control products,\" said Ray."

      "Given Australia's size and the fact that early settlements were far apart, Australian society is remarkably homogeneous  . Its citizens are fundamentally prosperous and the way of life in the major cities and towns is much the same however many miles divide them. _ However, there is some difference in lifestyle between city dwellers and the country people. Almost 90 per cent of the population lives in the fast-paced cities along the coast and has little more than a passing familiarity with the desert. The major cities preserve pockets of colonial heritage, but the overall impression is modern, with new buildings reflecting the country's youth. In contrast, the rural communities tend to be slow-moving and conservative. For many years, Australia was said to have \"ridden on the sheep's back\", a reference to wool being the country's main money earner. However, the wool industry is no longer dominant. Much of Australia's relatively sound economy is now achieved from natural coal and wheat, and by being the largest diamond producer in the world. Newer industries such as tourism and wine making are also increasingly important. Australians are generally friendly and relaxed, with a self-deprecating sense of humor. On the whole, Australia is a society without hierarchies  , an attitude generally held to stem from its prisoner beginnings.\nYet, contrary to widespread belief, very few Australians have true prisoner origins. Within only one generation of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia had become a nation of immigrants. Originally coming almost entirely from the British Isles, today one in three Australians comes from elsewhere. Australia's liberal postwar immigration policies led to an influx of survivors from war-torn Europe, most notably Greeks, Italians, Poles and Germans.\nThe emphasis has shifted in recent years and today the majority of new immigrants are from Southeast Asia. Today Australia is a 'blend of nations' and although some racism exists, _ has generally been a successful experiment and the country is justifiably proud to have one of the most harmonious multicultural communities in the world."

      "The world was mysterious   when I was a child, so miracles   were welcome wonders. Now, there doesn't seem to be space for them in this world I so intelligently understand.\nPerhaps it's from years of working around sick and often dying children, watching time and time again as a child slips away from the arms of a begging mother. I have stopped hoping as the parents around me hope.\nI recently cared for a patient near the end of his life. Medically speaking, his situation was hopeless, which made me feel helpless and defeated.\nHis mother came in to see him. I had prepared myself to support her, imagining she would crumble   into a pile of tears.\n\"Our God is faithful,\" she said, with a smile on her face and the sunshine of hope in her eyes.\n\"Cancer is faithful,\" I muttered   in my mind.\n\"We still believe he can heal him,\" she continued, as if she had heard what I was thinking.\nI provided updates on his body. In a laundry list of updates, perhaps two things were positive. She thanked me for the information, repeating back the minor positive notes I had given.\nI brcame kind of angry. And I wanted to sak, \"Do you really not understand the gravity   of this illness?\"\nAnd then, yet again, as if she had heard me, she replied with this: A positive attitude gives us power over our circumstances, rather than allowing our circumstances to have power over us.\nI was shocked. Here I was, judging her positive attitude as a fault. I completely disregarded the choice to believe in something more powerful than me, more healing than the doctors on our team. It wasn't blind faith. It was strength and devotion.\nWhen I came out of the room, tears welling in my eyes, I sat at my computer and looked\ndown at a small plate of candies she must have left for me on her way into the room. A hand\nwritten note was laid above them: Kate, your devotion is so appreciated, S.\nS, it is your devotion that I am appreciating today. Because of you, I am begging again to\nbelieve in miracles."

      "Educating girls quite possibly gets a higher rate of return than any other deal available in the developing world.Women's education may be unusual field for economists, but increasing women's contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social project.And economics, with its emphasis on incentives  , provides an explanation for why so many girls lose the chance of education.\nParents in low-income countries don't send their daughters to school because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else's family and bear children.Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and are kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school----the prophecy   becomes self-fulfilling, trapping women in a vicious circle  of abandonment.\nAn educated mother, on the other hand.has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices.She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance.The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys.will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a virtuous circle  .\nFew will argue that educating women has great social benefits.But it has enormous economic advantages as well.Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers.Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling.Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available deal, but they are just the beginning.Educating women also has a significant impact on health practices, including family planning."

      "In my last essay, I wrote briefly about a bathtub in the classroom. What really was the use of that bathtub? \"Guys, it is Reading Workshop time now. When I call your table, get your things, please!\" said Mrs. Toalson. She was holding a cup that had many sticks in it; on every stick was written each student's name and table number.\nWhat does she mean? Probably books, I thought. Mrs. Toalson picked a stick out of the cup and said, \"Okay, Aniqa's table; Table Two, you may get your things. \"Then my four classmates ran for the cushions in the bathtub. Mrs. Toalson kept picking sticks and calling out different table numbers. On hearing their numbers, students would run to get cushions. Because there were not enough cushions for everyone, the last to be called had to go without. Those students sighed, \"Oh! They are the lucky ones.\"\nFinally, Mrs. Toalson picked the last stick ; what is she going to do now?\n\"Kate, you may use the bathtub. \" Mrs. Toalson said. Gosh! Use the bathtub? Is Kate going to take a bath, I wondered. Kate is the girl who had pretty brown hair. She ran happily with her book to the bathtub and lay down in it. As she read, she hugged a teddy bear. I think it must be comfortable reading in a bathtub.\nExcept for lucky Kate, everybody had to read elsewhere. Some were sitting on the seats, some were lying down under the table, and everybody's reading pose was different.\nJust then, my friend found me sitting at my table quietly, not doing anything. She said, \"Mary, let me find you a book. \" I nodded. Then she led me to a comer of the classroom where the book-shelf was and picked a picture book for me.\nRegina thought that it would be more fun to read outside on the grass. What a great idea! The next day our whole class went to the park across the street from our school. As we read, animals such as squirrels ran around us. It was amazing !"

      "Children start out as natural scientists, eager to look into the world around them. Helping them enjoy science can be easy; there is no need for a lot of scientific terms or expensive lab equipment. You only have to share your children's curiosity. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once visited a classroom of seven -year- olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and whether I liked my job. When I finished answering, we sat facing one another in science. Finally I said,\" Now that we've finished with your lists, do you have questions of your own about science?\"\nAfter a long pause, a boy raised his hand, \"have you ever seen a grasshopper eat? When I try eating leaves like that, I get a stomachache. Why?\"\nThis began a set of questions that lasted nearly two hours.\nSecondly, give them time to think. Studies over the past 30 years have shown that. After asking a question, adults typically wait only one second or less for an answer, no time for a child to think. When adults increase their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children give more logical, complete and creative answers.\nThirdly, watch your language. Once you have a child involved in a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"very good\". These words work well when it comes to encouraging good behavior. But in talking about science, quick praise can signal that discussion is over. Instead, keep things going by saying, \"That's interesting\" or \"I'd never thought of it that way before', or coming up with more questions or ideas.\nNever push a child to \"think\". It doesn't make sense; children are always thinking, without your telling them to. What's more, this can turn a conversation into a performance. The child will try to find the answer you want, in as few words as possible, so that he will be a small target for your disagreement.\nLastly, show; don't tell. Real-life impressions of nature are far more impressive than any lesson children can learn from a book or a television program. Let children look at their fingertips through a magnifying glass, and they'll understand why you want them to wash before dinner. Rather than saying that water evaporates, set a pot of water to boil and let them watch the water level drop."

      "Boredom and Creativity\nMost of us think of being bored at work as a negative experience, but a new study suggests it can have positive results including an increase in creativity because it gives us time to daydream.\nThat is the finding of Dr. Sandi Mann from the University of Central Lancashire. Dr. Mann conducted two studies. In the first experiment, 40 people were asked to carry out a boring task. They were told to copy numbers out of a telephone directory for 15 minutes. After that they were asked to complete another task. A pair of cups were given to each of them. Everyone tried to come up with different uses of the cups, and was given a chance to display their creativity. Meanwhile, another group of 40 people were just asked to come up with uses for the cups without doing any boring tasks before. It turned out that the 40 people who had first copied out the telephone numbers were more creative than the control group .\nTo see if daydreaming was a factor in this effect, a second boring task was introduced that allowed even more daydreaming than the boring writing task. This second study saw 30 people copying out the numbers as before, but also included a second group of 30 reading rather than writing them.\nAgain the researchers found that the people in the control group were least creative, but the people who had just read the names were more creative than those who had to write them out. This suggests that more passive boring activities, like reading or perhaps attending meetings, can lead to more creativity. Compared with reading, writing reduced the scope  for daydreaming. As a result, it reduces the effects of boredom on creativity.\nDr. Mann says: \"Boredom at work has always been seen as something to be avoided, but perhaps we should accept it in order to promote our creativity. What we want to do next is to see what the practical implications of this finding are. Do people who are bored at work become more creative in other areas of their work--or do they go home and write novels?\""

      "Are you stuck in a rut and looking for a change? Fed up of seeing hungry, poor faces on your TV screen and want to do something to help? Perhaps you've considered volunteering overseas but ruled it out because you thought you were too old, couldn't commit enough time, or have a family. If so, think again.\n\"Over the past five years it has become far safer --- and more professionally acceptable --- to take up a job volunteering overseas,\" says David Stitt, managing director of Gap Year for Grown Ups, a company catering for volunteers in their late 20s and upwards. \"While 10 years ago _ took financial and personal risks in volunteering abroad, now several organizations exist to make the experience safe and well-organized.\nNowadays, universities and business encourage overseas volunteering among students and employees. Entire families can volunteer abroad, and agencies are employing more disabled and retired people. A prosperous \"humanitarian tourism\" industry has sprung up; thousands of UK citizens will do some form of overseas volunteering this year.\n\"Some volunteering jobs are easier to find than others,\" explains Kevin Cusack, from a volunteer advice agency. \"If you can speak English, it's not too hard to land a job teaching English, even without a qualification, and those who enjoy working with children should be able to find child care work.\" zxxk\nWhether your interest is rainforests or women's rights, you can find a volunteer position to suit you. But be warned: unless you have relevant skills or existing overseas development experience, it's going to cost. Just how much depends on the location and length of the position, but you should budget for somewhere between PS1,500 and PS6,000.\n\"Having to pay to volunteer may sound paradoxical  , but it's the best way to ensure you get a position that benefits the local community while matching your interests and skills,\" explains Cusack.  \"You can also discuss the time you want to commit to a project --- many positions can fit into a holiday or even a weekend.\""

      "When the lazy days of summer arrive and the schedule is filled with swimming,camp,and family vacations,it can be a challenge to find time for learning. But kids' reading skills don't have to grow cold once school's out. Here are some ways to make reading a natural part of their summer fun:\nExplore your library. Visit your local library to borrow books and magazines that your kids haven't seen before. Many libraries have summer reading programs, book clubs, and reading contests  for even the youngest borrowers. With a new library card,a child will feel extra grownup by borrowing books.\nRead on the road. Going on a long car trip?Make sure there are some books at the back seat. When you stop driving,read the books aloud. Get some audio books in libraries and listen to them together during driving time.\nMake your own books. Pick one of your family's favorite parts of summer--whether it's baseball,ice cream, or the pool--and have your child draw pictures of it or cut out pictures from magazines. Stick  the pictures onto paper to make a booklet and write text for it. When you're done,read the book together. Reread it whenever you like!\nKeep in touch. Kids don't have to go away to write about summer vacation. Even if your family stays home,they can send postcards to tell friends and relatives about their adventures . Ask a relative to be your child's pen pal and encourage them to write each week.\nKeep up the reading habits. Even if everything else changes during the summer,keep up the reading habits around your house. Read with your kids every day--whether it's just before bedtime or under a shady tree on a lazy afternoon. And don't forget to take a book to the beach!Just brush the sand off the pages -- it's no sweat!"

      "A regular drop in the sun's radiation  can cause unusually cold winters in parts of North America and Europe, scientists say, a finding that could improve long-range forecasts and help countries prepare for snowstorms.\nScientists have known for a long time that the sun has an 11-year cycle during which radiation measured by sunspots on the surface reaches a peak then falls. But explaining a clear connection to weather is harder.\n\"Our research confirms the observed connection between solar change and regional winter climate,\" lead author Sarah Ineson of the UK Met Office told the reporters in an email. The study was published in the magazine Nature Geoscience on Monday.\nThe researchers found that the reducing of ultraviolet(UV,) radiation from the sun can affect high-altitude wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere , causing cold winters.\n\"While UV levels won't tell us what the day-to-day weather will do, they show us the bright future of improved forecasts for winter conditions for months and even years ahead. These forecasts play an important role in long-term possibility planning,\" Ineson, a climate scientist, said.\nIneson and colleagues from Imperial College London and the University of Oxford used satellite data that more accurately  measures UV radiation from the sun and found a much greater change than previously thought.\nThey found that in years of low activity, unusually cold air forms high in the atmosphere over the tropics. This causes a redistribution  of heat in the atmosphere, making easterly winds that bring freezing weather and snowstorms to northern Europe and the United States and milder weather to Canada and the Mediterranean.\nWhen solar UV radiation is stronger, the opposite occurs.\nMore study was needed, though. A key uncertainty in the experiment lay in the satellite data used, because it covers only a few years. \"So questions remain concerning both accuracy  and also applicability to other solar cycles,\" she said."

The computer is reporting nothing more than what the clerk typed into it .\nThe most annoying case of all is when the computerized cash register in the grocery store shows that an item costs more than it actually does .

That high-tech cash register is really nothing more than an electric eye . The eye reads the Universal Product Code--that ribbon of black and white lines on the package --and then checks the code against a price list stored in memory . If the price list is right , you'll be charged accurately .\nGrocery stores update the price list each day--that is , somebody sits at a keyboard and types in the prices . If the price they type in is too high , there are only two explanations : carelessness or dishonesty . But somehow \"a computer error\" is supposed to excuse everything .\nOne reason we let people hide behind a computer is the common misunderstanding that huge , modern computers are \"electric brains\" with \"artificial intelligence.\" At some point there might be a machine with intelligence , but none exists today .

Karsh asked him to remove the cigar and,when he didn't,stepped forward and gently removed it with the comment,\"Forgive me,Sir.\"Churchill glowered   as the shot was taken,then permitted Karsh to take still another,;jokingly commenting,\"You can even make a roaring lion stand still to be photographed.\" The Churchill portrait has since appeared in publications all over the world.\nKarsh traveled to London in 1943 with his portable studio ---- an 8-by-10 view camera and many studio lamps to photograph such notables as George Bernard Shaw and the royal family.All these portraits fully illustrate Karsh's ability."

      "The Mayan Indians lived in Mexico for thousands of years. The Maya were so bright that they achieved a lot. They had farms, temples and cities with many buildings. They knew much about nature and the world around them. This knowledge helped them to live a better life than most people of that time.\nIn ancient Mexico there were many small clearings in the forest. In each clearing was a village with fields of crops around it. The Maya planted seeds after they cleared the land. A farmer was able to grow crops that produced for several people. But not every Maya had to be a farmer. Some were builders or priests  .\nThe Maya believed in many gods. They built large temples to honor them. Skillful workers built cities around these temples. It was difficult because they had to carry all of the building materials themselves. Today, many of these ancient Mayan cities and temples are still standing.\nAlthough the Maya worked hard to build the beautiful cities, very few of them lived in them. Usually, only the priests lived in the cities. The other people lived in small villages in the forests. Their houses were much simpler. Most Maya lived a simple life close to nature.\nMeasuring time correctly was important to the Maya, so Mayan priests made a system to keep track of time. They wrote numbers as dots ( ... ) and bars ( -- ). They also made a calendar  . The year was divided into 18 months of 20 days each with five days left over.\nAround the year 800, the Maya left their villages and beautiful cities, never to return. No one knows why this happened. They may have died from a deadly disease. They may have left because the soil could no longer grow crops. The lost secrets of the Maya are still beyond the reach of modern people. _ are still one of our greatest mysteries  ."

      "I've cheated in school when I thought that I could get away with it. I'm not proud of it and I don't usually feel very good about myself afterwards, but sometimes it's the only way possible to survive in a pressure cooker. My parents are really set on my getting good grades. They study my report card the same way they examine the newspaper's stock market page. And they make me feel that I've got to live up to their expectations.\nBut often it's like each teacher acts as if his is the only subject we have. They think nothing of piling on our homework or giving surprise quizzes. Sometimes we have to take two or three tests in different subjects on the same day. I'd like to see a lot of adults I know preparing for that.\nWhen the pressure becomes too high, some kids may resort to   cheating. If you have three or four subjects to study for, you're not going to be able to devote enough time to each subject in order to be well prepared for each class. Besides, it may be the only way left to live up to your parents' expectations and compete with the top students in the class.\nEverybody knows that if you cheat, it's important not to get caught. Few things can cause more of chaos. Once, my elder brother got caught cheating on a math final. My parents acted as though he'd committed a federal crime. The assistant principal called them to school, but although the incident caused several conferences, I don't think that anybody ever really understood what my brother was going through. We're just supposed to perform outstandingly as well as always act honestly, but how many adults can actually live up to the standards they set for us?\nMy father has gotten countless traffic tickets for parking in no parking zones or for not coming to a full stop at stop signs. And you've always hearing about people who don't file their incomes tax honestly. How about all the corruption in government? Successful adults often accept dishonesty in order to achieve their business goals. Are kids the only ones who are supposed to be perfect?\nMost of my friends have cheated on tests in school at one time or another. The kids who never cheated are usually either afraid of getting caught or just don't know how to do it safely. Nobody wants to cheat. But if it's a choice of being honest or of getting a better grade, most kids will try for the latter. That may sound wrong, but we didn't make the rules, we're just trying to get by."

      "Have you thought about what determines the way we are as we grow up? Remember the TV program Seven Up ? It started following the lives of a group of children in 1963. We first meet them as wide-eyed seven-year-olds and then catch up with them at seven-year intervals ( )  : nervous  14-year-olds , serious  21-year-olds , then  grown-ups.\n     Some of the stories are inspiring ,others sad ,but what is interesting in almost all the cases is the  way  in which  the  children's early hopes and dreams are  shown  in their future lives, for example ,at seven ,Tony is a lively child who says he wants to become a sportsman or a taxi driver. When he grows up, he goes on to do both.  How about Nicki ,who says, \"I'd like to find out about the moon. \" and goes on to become a space scientist.  As a child, soft - spoken Bruce says he wants to help \"poor children\" and ends up teaching in India.\n      But if the lives of all the children had followed this pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up? Are children influenced by what their parents do ,by what they see on television ,or by what their teachers say? How great is the effect of a single important event? Many film directors ,including Stephen Spielberg ,say that an early visit to the cinema was the turning point in their lives.  Dr. Magaret  Mc Allister ,who has done a lot of research in this area ,thinks that the major influences are parents , friends and the wider society."

      "One of the big challenges that students face in applying to universities abroad is writing the application essay.\nThe essay topics all have something in common. They attempt to get at what type of person you are, what motivates you,and what you feel passion for. In a single 500-word piece of writing,\nadmissions officers attempt to gather all about you. _ \nYou can try and guess what the admissions officers like. But that won't work.The essay will sound empty and become another dull piece of writing,which admissions officers get thousands of each year.\nIt is true that admissions officers aren't exactly looking for anything. The answer is just as open-ended as the question itself. If they ask for someone who has inspired you, it could be anyone. It could be a grandmother, a teacher, or even a character from a movie. A lot of people will say their dad. But since you really feel it, you'll have a lot to write about.\nThere are some important things to remember.These admissions officers want good writers. You don't have to be Ernest Hemingway, but you have to be able to form an interesting story.That means revision and editing,cutting out stupid grammar mistakes,reading it over several times,leaving it for a few days and looking at it again. Whatever you do, make sure the essay is as good as possible.\nAlso,you should use exciting language and really make the reader feel the same passion as you do. It also means finding something unique about your point of view, something that other people might not think of.For example,if you want to write about your dad, you can focus on a specific anecdote about him .Admissions officers love personal stories that ring true."

      "All over the world,libraries have begun the great task of making faithful digital copies of the books and records that protect the mental efforts of mankind*. For armchair schools,the work promises to bring such a wealth of information to desktop that the present Internet may not match. \n    Librarians see three clear benefits to going digital. First,it helps them preserve rare and easily broken objects without refusing the demands of those who wish to study them. The British Library, for example,holds the only medieval(middle-aged)manuscript of Beowuif in London. Only quantified scholars were allowed to set and put the images up on the Internet for anyone to use. \n    A second benefit is convenience. Once books arc changed to digital form, readers can find them in seconds rather than minutes. Several people can read the same book or view the same picture at the same time. Clerks are spared the chore  of reserving. And libraries could use the Internet to lend their collections to those who are unable to visit in person. \n    The third advantage of electronic copies is that they occupy millimeters of space on a magnetic disk rather than meters on a shelf. The cost of library buildings is increasingly high. The University of California at prefix = st1 /Berkeleyrecently spent $46 million on all underground addition to house 1. 5 million books at an average cost of $30 per set of them.

      "On Sept 18, they arrived before polling stations even opened, dressed in school uniforms, with book bags over their shoulders--and, for the first time in British history, ballot   cards in hands.\nMore than 109,000 Scottish teenagers aged 16 to 17 took part in the Scottish independence referendum  , in which Scotland eventually decided not to become independent.\nThe age group only made up a small part of the 4.29 million total voters, but they have \"demonstrated how the youngest voters can be some of the most enthusiastic in a mature democracy\", commented The Associated Press. Casting their ballots, they were \"proud and passionate\" to help their nation decide whether to break away from the UK after 307 years in union.\n\"You feel like you've got a say, because it is going to be you. You are going to decide what it is like when you're older,\" 16-year-old Erin Cheshire in Glasgow, who voted \"yes\", told The Wall Street Journal.\nAt age 16, Scottish residents are allowed to join the military, get married, and work. Eighteen is the legal drinking age, as well as the UK's voting age. But in 2013, Scottish law was changed to allow 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland to vote in the referendum. The government pushed for the change because \"younger voters are more likely to vote with their hearts, not their heads--and _ fundamental change by voting for the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign\", NBC News said.\nBut when the decision was handed down, some worried that high school students might not be as informed as adult voters. However, many experts said that assumption was wrong.\nProfessor Jan Eichhorn of the University of Edinburgh insisted that Scottish teenagers were as likely to read newspaper articles and campaign materials as their parents. They would simply get these resources through social media.\n\"There's no evidence to suggest that they're less capable than adults of voting, from a research point of view,\" Eichhorn told NPR.\nScotland's move to let younger teenagers vote in the referendum has led to a discussion about whether the voting age ought to be lowered to 16, both in the UK and the US.\n\"By 16, most people have about as stable an ideology   as they are going to get,\" Professor Jason Brennan of Georgetown University wrote for CNN, arguing that the US should also think about allowing younger US citizens to vote."

His name was Ed and he dropped her off for her doctor's appointment, and was going to park the car and wait for her. She was so upset because he never came back to get her. As she described her situation to the person on the phone she started to cry and I knew I needed to take action. \nAfter I introduced myself, she told me her name was Helen. She was talking to a local restaurant they were going to have lunch at after her appointment. She called to see if he was there. She explained her husband \"Ed\" was supposed to park the car and wait for her. Then she said,\" My husband has Alzheimer's  and he shouldn't be driving without me.\" Numerous thoughts ran through my head. Call the police, call her family, call the doctor's office she had just come from ! I offered to drive to the local restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. \nAfter telling the nurse about the situation we exchanged cell phone numbers in case Ed showed up as I jumped into action searching for him. Once arriving in the parking lot of the restaurant, Helen described she received a call from the nurse, who had found Ed sitting on a bench in front of the hospital a few buildings down waiting for her. What a relief ! Once reunited, we needed to find his car which he forgot where he parked! Fortunately, he parked in the handicapped spot so it was easy to find!\nOnce all this was done, I followed Ed and Helen home to be sure they arrived safely.

      "Well-known Chinese writer, literary translator and foreign literature researcher Yang Jiang died at the age of 105 in Beijing on 25 May, 2016.\nYang, the wife of late Chinese novelist Qian Zhongshu, enjoyed decades of fame across the country for her literature works such as Six Chapters from My Life\"Downunder\"(1981), Baptism(1988), and We Three(2004), which recalls her husband and her daughter Qian Yuan(1937-1997) who died of cancer one year before her father's death. Her translation of the Spanish novel Don Quixote de la Mancha<<>>  is widely considered the best Chinese version so far. \nYang Jiang, whose original name was Yang Jikang, was born in Beijing and grew up in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu province. She got her master's degree in foreign languages and literature at Tsinghua University, where she met her husband Qian Zhongshu, whose later work, the satirical novel Fortress Besieged <<>>  is famous around the world. The couple married in 1935 and during 1935 to 1938, they went to Oxford University for further study. They returned to China in 1938 and both of them went into academia   and made important contributions to the development of Chinese culture. Yang and Qian were known for having the perfect love story in Chinese literary circles. Qian once commented that Yang was \"the most virtuous wife and most talented lady\". Apart from her own achievements in literature, she made a great contribution to Qian's works after his death. More than 70,000 letters and drafts by her husband were collected by her for the publication Qian Zhongshu's Manuscript Collection in 2003. \nYang loved reading and encouraged the younger generation to read more books. She donated millions of yuan that she earned through sales of her works to Tsinghua University and set up the \"Love Reading\" scholarship in the name of her family after her husband and daughter passed away."

      "In much of the world, authority   is not challenged either out of respect or out of fear, sometimes, too, because a hierarchy   of rank has been fixed for so long that people have been trained for generations never to challenge it.\nIn such countries children are not expected to question their teachers in school, and young scholars or inventive industrial talents are hampered in technical research because they hesitate to disagree with their \"superiors\". Clever researchers may be considered too young to have \"any right\" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.\nThe American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. \"Go look it up for yourself\", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to \"write a paper on the world's supply of sugar\" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas. Even in the primary grades, children are taught to use libraries, and to search for new ideas. By the time they are 14, 15, and 16, many young scholars are making original and valuable contributions in all fields of science. Industry is so aware of this resource that each year, through national competitions, it offers tremendous awards among teenagers to seek out the brilliant minds across the country.\nAs seen by members of other nations, this emphasis on questioning and searching is bad for young people's \"manners\". Foreigners often feel great \"lack of respect\" in our youth. Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members \"daring\" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions. One's own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of \"no confidence\". Our whole approach to research is different. Your ideas are being looked at, not you yourself. To us the two are quite separate. This is the way our mind work. We are seeking facts; we are not challenging you as a person. So, too, even in social conversation you will find that people often argue, pick an idea apart, ask for your sources or challenge your conclusions. They do not mean to be rude; they are keenly interested and merely trying to explore the idea in greater depth."

      "Survey Studies Internet Use in China\nA typical  Chinese Internet user is a young male who prefers instant messaging to e-mail, seldom makes online purchases  and favors news, music and games sites. According to a study, about two-thirds of survey participants use the Internet for news -- often entertainment-related -- or for online games. About half download music and movies.\nThey also tend to prefer instant messaging to e-mail, and they are depending on the Internet more frequently than before to communicate with others who have the same professions, hobbies and political interests. Online purchases still remain unpopular in China. Three-quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet, and only 10 percent make purchases even once a month. Among those who do buy online, most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards, or computer hardware or software.\n\"Many people don't trust the quality of goods bought online,\" Guo said Wednesday. \"If they buy it in a store and don't like it, they can easily bring it back.\"\nThe survey was done in five major cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha. Results do not necessarily project countrywide because Internet use in rural areas is lower than in cities. Guo describes the typical netizen in the five cities surveyed as young, male, richer and more highly educated. Males make up two-thirds of the Internet community, and more than 80 percent of users are under. Among people ages 25 to 29, 60 percent to 80 percent go online.\nChina has more than 100 million people online, second in the world to the United States."

      "Could radar be the answer to keeping an eye on elderly people without invading their privacy? That's what the researchers are aiming to prove with their experiment. They say using radar could keep track of older  s and even detect when they fall over.\nRight now, 40 million Americans are over the age of 65, and the Census Bureau   predicts that by the year 2030, 80 million Americans will be 65 or older. Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population.\nMany elderly individuals choose to live alone, which causes a great risk as falls and other illnesses become more likely as a person ages. In order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone, researchers are examining the use of through-the-wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces.\nGraduate students were trained in walking, falling, and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted in the radar-imaging lab on the campus. A clinical instructor and an expert educated and trained the students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk--with or without the assistance of canes or walkers.\nTheir research focuses on various applications for radar imaging, including search and rescue, defense, and law enforcement. Dr Amin and his team, through a grant from Qatar University, are now developing a series of algorithms   to identify the patterns and routines of an elderly person in his or her home.\nThe radar, with the help of these algorithms, can detect when a person is sitting, standing, walking and so on. They say detection of motion, and even classification of what sort of motion it is (such as walking or falling), can be achieved in all rooms inside a home with just one or a few radar units.\n\"Radar has become a mature technology,\" explains Dr Amin. \"So people have started thinking about transitioning this technology into healthcare.\""

      "The film \"Avatar\" has received great popularity around the world. It turned out to be a great success. The film got $1 billion in ticket sales in a very short time. The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.\nAs to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.\nIn order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\""

      "From the very beginning of school we make books and reading a constant source of possible failure and public humiliation. When children are little we make them read aloud, before the teacher and other children, so that we can be sure they \"know\" all the words they are reading. This means that when they don't know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone. After having taught fifth-grade classes for four years, I decided to try at all costs to rid them of their fear and dislike of books, and to get them to read oftener and more adventurously.\nOne day soon after school had started, I said to them, \"Now I'm going to say something about reading that you have probably never heard a teacher say before. I would like you to read a lot of  books this year, but I want you to read them only for pleasure. I am not going to ask you questions to find out whether you understand the books or not. If you understand enough of a book to enjoy it and want to go on reading it, that's enough for me. Also I'm not going to ask you what words mean. \"\nThe children sat stunned and silent. Was this a teacher talking? One girl, who had just come to us from a school where she had had a very hard time, looked at me steadily for a long time after I had finished. Then, still looking at me, she said slowly and seriously, Mr Holt, do you really mean that?\" I said just as seriously, \"I mean every word of it.\nDuring the spring she really astonished me. One day, she was reading at her desk, From a glimpse of the illustrations I thought I knew what the book was. I said to myself, \"It can't be,\" and went to take a closer look. Sure enough, she was reading Moby Dick , in edition with woodcuts. I said, \"Don't you find parts of it rather heavy going?\" She answered, Oh, sure, but I just skip over those parts and go on to the next good part. \"\nThis is exactly what reading should be and in school so seldom is, an exciting, joyous adventure. Find something, dive into it, take the good parts, skip the bad parts, get what you can out of it, go on to something else.

      "To win an Oscar is an achievement at any age. To do so at 22, like Jennifer Lawrence, is just amazing. Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film Silver Linings Playbook. According to time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is a rare young actress who lends mature intelligence to any role.\nThough Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, she wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent.\nLawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition .\n\"I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,\" Lawrence said. \"Within 20 minutes in the cab ride from the hotel, I decided I didn't want to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress.\" Having appreciated this young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading that they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so she could pay her full attention to her acting career.\nLawrence burst onto the Hollywood scene last year with The Hunger Games, which established her as the highest-grossing female action hero of all time. Rolling Stone called her \"the most talented young actress in America\" ."

      "The porter brings your bags to your room and helpfully explains all you want to know. Then he points to the phone and says, \"If there's anything else you need, just call.\" All this time you have been thinking one thing, \"How much should I tip  him?\" To make your next trip a little easier, here's a guide to tipping across some Asian countries.\nBangkok\nIn general, the more Westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip. Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate you tacking on  the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip. Keep the change for yourself."

If the driver wants to drive again, he or she has to do public service, and take part in educational programs.\n  You may think: drunk driving is crime? Isn't this law too unkind?

      "In Victorian times, certain flowers expressed meanings because the flower selection was limited. Therefore, flower as a gift was an effective tool in social communication. With so many choices today, we have no rules in flower choosing. However, people tend to give a certain flower their own personal meaning--- maybe it can remind them of some particular friends or events. Here I would introduce the traditional meanings of some gift flowers as a reference for your flower choosing.\nCarnation  is a good gift for your female teacher or mother, but not all kinds of carnations men respect and love. Different colours have different meanings. Generally, carnation means \"fascination and woman love\". Specifically, pink carnation means \"I'll never forget you\" and red carnation says \"I admire you\". But some carnations have very negative meanings. If you want to say goodbye to your girlfriend, you can send her a bunch of striped carnations or yellow ones, because it means \"Sorry I can't be with you. You disappointed me.\"\nRose is no doubt the best gift for girls in love. Basically, it relates to the love between men and women, but roses with different colours stand for different stages of love. Red rose is man's best friend when he wants to show his love to a girl. In the peak of his love, pink rose is more suitable because it means \"perfect happiness and please believe me\". While the love gets into trouble, yellow rose seems to be the best symbol. It means \"the decrease of love and jealousy\".\nThough you are free to choose any kind of flower as long as it is beautiful, I think this breif introduction can help you avoid making mistakes. Besides, the receivers must be happier if he or she gets to know the good will you convey in flowers."

      "The zebra belongs to the horse family. One of nature's great mysteries is why the zebra has stripes  . One theory is that the stripes help the zebra cool down. On hot days the black stripes get a lot hotter than the white area of the zebra and under the black stripes there are special layers of fat for protection. Hot air then rises off the black stripes, forcing colder air down around the white areas, cooling the zebra down. This, however, is just a kind of theory. The stripes can also confuse predators(,) when zebras stay with other animals in great numbers. \nZebras have excellent hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 56 kilometers per hour. They also have a powerful kick that can cause serious injury to a predator, like a lion, or an African wild dog. Usually the lead male of the herd stays at the back of the group to defend against predators if necessary, while the females and youngsters escape danger.\nZebras are herbivores that feed only on plants and live mostly by eating grasses, although they also might eat a bit on the leaves and stems  of bushes. They eat grasses for many hours each day, using their strong teeth. Spending so much time chewing wears the zebras' teeth down, so their teeth keep growing all their lives. As the dry season arrives and the grasses die back, zebra herds travel to find more food and water holes for drinking. Most zebras have no specific territories. They travel from place to place, never staying in one area very long."

      "Winter is coming. It's time for the arctic ground squirrel  to get her underground home ready. She chooses a quiet spot, hidden from wolves and foxes. She gathers grass and fur to keep her home warm.\nWinter is long and cold in northern Canada. Many days, the air is colder than the air in your freezer. Plants can't grow, so there are no leaves or grass for animals to eat. They must find other ways to live. The arctic ground squirrel \"sleeps\" the winter away.\nFor months the ground squirrel has been eating lots of seeds, mushrooms, and berries. Now she is fat. The extra fat will keep her alive through the winter.\nAt last she crawls through a tunnel into the nest she has made. She curls up, wraps her tail around herself, and goes to \"sleep\". Only she won't really be sleeping. She will be hibernating .\nThe ground squirrel's body is usually as warm as yours. When she hibernates, her body becomes just colder than ice, but she doesn't freeze. In the warm season, when the ground squirrel is active, she uses most of the food she eats to make heat to stay warm. When she hibernates, she doesn't need much food.\nHer heart beats just one or two times each minute. She will take only about three breaths each minute. She won't move, even if someone touches her or shines a light into her eyes.\nThese changes in the ground squirrel's body let her live through the winter.\nThe ground squirrel will not stay in hibernation all winter. Her body warms up and becomes active for a few hours once every few weeks. Over the winter, these active times use up more than half of the energy that she worked so hard to store. Why does she do this?\nScientists aren't sure. Some think arctic ground squirrels must warm up in case their bodies\nneed to fight off any germs  that would make them sick.\nIn April or May the arctic ground squirrel will stop hibernating. She will be skinny because she did not eat anything during the winter. Now she will have just a few months to have babies and fatten up before winter comes again."

      "Lightning flashed through the darkness over Donald Lubeck's bedroom skylight.The 80-year-old retired worker was shaken by a blast of thunder.It was 11 p.m.The storm had moved directly over his two-story wood home in the rural town of Belchertown, Massachusetts.Then he heard the smoke alarm beeping.Lubeck padded down the stairs barefoot and opened the door to the basement, and flames exploded out.\nLubeck fled back upstairs to call 119 from his bedroom ,but the phone didn't work.Lubeck realized he was trapped.\"I started panicking,\" he says.\nHis daughter and young granddaughters ,who lived with him ,were away for the night.No one will even know I'm home, he thought.His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by pines that Lubeck knew calling for help would be fruitless.\nUp a hill about a third of a mile away lived Lubeck's closest neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife.Wentworth had been lying down, listening to the radio when it occurred to him that the sound was more like a smoke detector.He jumped out of bed ,grabbed a cordless phone and a flashlight, and headed down the hillside toward the noise.\nHe dialed 119\"Is anyone there?\" he called out as he approached the house.Wentworth knew that Lubeck lived in the house.\nThen he heard ,\"Help me! I'm  trapped!\" coming from the balcony off Lubeck's bedroom.\n\"I ran in and yelled, 'Don, where are you ?'Then I had to run outside to catch my breath.\"\nAfter one more attempt inside the house, he gave up and circled around back.But there was no way to get to him.\"I shined the flashlight into the woods next to an old shed and noticed a adder,\" says Wentworth.He dragged it over to the balcony and pulled Lubeck down just as the second floor of the house collapsed.\nWentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other regularly, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help ,Wentworth will be there.\nLubeck still chokes up when he tells the story.\"I was alone,\"he says.\"Then I heard the most beautiful sound in my life.It was Jeremie.\""

      "Ecotourism:A Different Way to Travel\nAre you attracted to unknown places?Do you prefer to vacation away from other tourists?Are you careful to take only memories and to leave only footprints? If you answered yes to more than one of these questions,you just might be an ecotourist.\nEcotourists are people who want to experience the unspoiled natural world--and leave it that way when they return home. This trend started in the 1990s,and ecotourism is now growing three times faster than the entire tourism industry . The Kapawi Ecolodge in Ecuador's remote Amazon Basin is contributing to that expansion,and it gives a snapshot of what ecotourism looks like.\nAt the Ecolodge,a small group of cabins sits in the middle of the Achuar people's reserve and is only accessible by air. From here,visitors can explore parts of the Amazon rainforest seen by few outsiders. As they do,local Achuar guides explain how the forest is like their supermarket,where they find food,clothing,medicine and tools. As a result,tourists learn to appreciate the local culture as well as the natural environment.\nThe owners of Kapawi pay monthly rent to the Achuar people,but they also train the community to run and manage the lodge. They have agreed on a plan to turn the operation over to the Achuar completely by 2011.The owners are working to make ecotourism benefit and empower the local people.\nYou probably won't start your own ecolodge,but you can be an ecotourist if you follow these guidelines:Protect the environment;Support local businesses;Respect the local customs and traditions.\nThe world is full of fascinating places to visit. As an ecotourist,you can enjoy them yourself and make sure that they remain beautiful for future generations as well."

      "The first time my father and I ever went fishing became a family legend . We spent hours waiting for a bite. The sun was bursting with fire. We were hot, sticky, and mad that the fish refused to suck up our night crawlers .\nBeing only seven years old, I observed that perhaps the worms were the problem. Maybe the night crawlers only moved at night, and now they were just lying there motionless on the hook. Dad ignored my assessment of the situation.\nWe began to pack up to leave. As we headed back to our truck, we heard tires spinning in the distance. Getting into our truck was tough. Having sat in the boiling sun for six hours, the seats were blistering. Naturally, I was wearing shorts.\nI shifted from side to side in the seat so as not to cook my bottom. While driving out we saw a truck with a boat trailer and boat that was stuck in the mud. That explained the sound of spinning tires we'd heard.\nBeing a nice guy, my dad helped pull the man from the mud. In return, this fellow gave Dad some fish for being a Good Samaritan. As Dad climbed back into our truck with a brown bag full of fish, we waved goodbye to our newfound friend.\nOn the drive home, we agreed to take in the fish as if we had caught them. We were sure there was no way for Mom to know the difference. It was just a little white lie.\nWe arrived home hot, sweaty, and smelly, and went to clean up while Mom prepared the fish. We made a big deal out of the fact that we had already cleaned them and put them in the bag so as not to make a mess.\nAfter showering, Dad and I met in the hall and exchanged conspiratorial grins . Sitting down to freshly fried fish, we started eating happily and went on about how good something tasted that we had actually caught ourselves. Mother looked suitably impressed.\nAs we got up to do the dishes, Mom cleared her throat. \"I just have one question of you two great fishermen,\" she said. We looked at her expectantly, thinking we had another opportunity to delight her with our great fishing ability. With a tiny smile, Mom asked, \"How was it again that you two managed to not only clean your fish, but also freeze them before you got home.\""

It's located just southwest of the Italian mainland and it's the largest Mediterranean island.\nInvaded by many armies over the centuries, it became the site of Roman and Greek colonies. Those cultures remain to this day.\nAlthough they have a rich culture and history, Sicilian people lead a simple life. Living on land with fertile  soil, most of them work in agriculture, fishing and mining, and of course tourism.\nIn Sicily, most stores and businesses are closed from one to four in the afternoon. Street become crowded around five as people start to go out and engage in a variety of activities. They may take a walk to the shops, enjoy a pastry or just meet up with friends.\nFood is one of the great pleasures of Sicilian people. There is an old Sicilian saying:\"With a contented stomach, your heart is forgiving. With an empty stomach you forgive nothing.\" People will go miles out their way to eat fresh seafood. Pasta is the main food Each region has its seasonal pasta dishes, and every family cook their own specialty. Bread is common too. As another Sicilian saying goes, \"A table without bread is like a day without sunshine.\" In Sicily, bread is always freshly baked or bought, and usually twice a day."

For example, for one person, it may mean being in a relationship, while for someone else it may mean feeling you have the ability to handle whatever life throws at you.\n     While you might think that there are certain things that make you happy (or could make you happy if you had them), research has shown that there are certain common qualities among happy people--and it isn't necessarily what you might have thought.\n     You might think that happy people have lots of money, are physically attractive or have great jobs. Or, you might just think happy people are simply lucky, and are bom that way.\n     Research suggests, however, that there are a number of variables  that make a far greater contribution to happiness than outer and more superficial factors .\n    That doesn't mean that if you have a lot of money you won't be happy, or that having a lot of money is bad, it just means that other factors are more important in determining happiness. In fact, a strong positive relationship between wealth and happiness only exists for those who live below the poverty line and/or who are unemployed.\n     What makes happy people different from the others is that they have a different attitude-a different way of thinking about things and doing things.

Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of human illness is related to food and forty percent of cancer is related to food as well. That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, some researchers realized that things commonly used to keep colour in meats and other food additives caused cancer.\nYet, these additives remain in our food, and it is difficult to know which things on the wrappings of foods are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to their animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of cows. Sometimes similar tings are supplied to animals not for their health, but just to make a profit.\nThe farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to get a higher price on the market.

Quite a few cities such as Stockholm, London, Florence and Munich now offer extensive networks of well-marked bike lanes.\nCopenhagen take it as a step future by keeping bicycles and motor vehicles physically separate as much as possible. On these routes, stoplights are adjusted to the rhythms of bicycles, not cars. And the routs are lined with bicycle pump stations that are designed to the Daily Star.\nFor people living far from city centers, getting to work by bicycles alone may not be time-efficient. That's why many European countries now allow cyclists to bring their bicycles onto subway trains.\nEuropeans are also creative in solving parking problems. The Daily Star reported that Amsterdam has come up with a high-tech solution: you lock your bike to a rack  , which then revolves underground. When you want your bike back, the rack rotates   it back to the surface."

      "If man's best friend is a dog, then who is a dog's best friend? That would be Rover, Glow, Ivan or Raina. They recently donated   blood to other dogs. And they did it without having to travel far from home: they visited an animal bloodmobile.\nLike the Red Cross vehicles for humans, the University of Pennsylvania's traveling vet lab goes to where the donors are to make it easier to give. The bloodmobile makes weekly rounds through Philadelphia and New Jersey.\nLike humans, not every dog is qualified  to donate blood. The dogs are examined for health first. Dogs must have the correct blood type, weigh at least 55 pounds and be under 8 year old. About 150 dogs take part in the program. Each donates three or four pints  a year, which can help animals suffering from illness like cancer or an accident like being hit by a car.\nSandy Lucas brought her 7-year-old dog, Raina, to the bloodmobile last week. She said she wouldn't have taken the dog to Penn Vet's animal hospital in downtown Philadelphia, which is twice as far from her home. \"I was very, very excited that she had the right blood that was needed to help another dog out,\" said Lucas. \"We'll surely do it again.\"\nJust like people, the donors get a snack and a heart-shaped sticker immediately after giving. What's more, they receive dog food to take home.\nIf dogs are doing what they can to save other dogs, why can't we do it to save other people? Next time you hesitate  over whether to donate blood or not, think of the dogs."

      "After having exercise in the gym tonight, I just had a shower to relax for a while. While calming myself down with soft music, I started to recall what happened in the daytime and wrote it down.\nThe accident that gave me much thought happened on my way to the gym after work. When I walked about half way, I saw that many people surrounded something on the roadside and they were worried and shocked. I joined them and found there was a man lying on the ground. I noticed that he was a young man around 30 years old. He looked so pale and very thin. From his dressing, I simply judged that he worked in the office. The hospital ambulance came over and some nurses did the regular check for him. A nurse said that there was nothing serious with him but his body was very weak, which should be caused by overwork and less exercise.\nIt's a really sad thing for a young person to fall down in the street. A couple of days ago, I read a magazine mentioning that there is an increasing number of businessmen and white-collar workers with unhealthy bodies. Under huge pressure, they put all their time and energy to work and can't find enough time for a good meal or a good sleep, let alone exercise. But they forget that without health, work is equivalent to zero.\nAs I realize how important it is to put the health matter ahead, I am willing to do more exercise. I know exercise can bring me enjoyment and health. I know without health, even a most successful career and a great quantity of money will lose their meanings. \nWhen I got out of the gym, I felt that every cell in my body was refreshed and I was able to have more energy to write the words above. The feeling in sweat was wonderful!"

      "The fiddler crab   is a living clock. It indicates(=shows) the time of day by the colour of its skin, which is dark by day and pale by night. The crab's changing colour follows a regular twenty--four hour plan that exactly matches the daily rhythm   of the sun.\n    Does the crab actually keep time, or does its skin simply answer to the sun's rays, changing colour according to the amount of light strikes it? To find out, biologists kept crabs in a dark room for two months. Even without daylight, the crab's skin colour continued to change exactly on time.\n    This characteristic   probably developed gradually in answer to the daily rising and setting of the sun, to help protect the crab from sunlight and enemies. After millions of years it has become completely regulated   inside the living body of the crab.\n    The biologists noticed that once each day the colour of the fiddler crab is especially dark, and that each day this happens fifty minutes later than on the day before. From this they discovered that each crab follows not only the rhythm of the sun but also that of the tides  . The crab's period of greatest darkening is exactly the time of low tide on the beach where it was caught!"

The director with his new film, the designer with the latest fashion, and the musician with the popular songs are part of the new Outlook. The program is introduced by Fran Levine.\n9:00 PM----Discovery\nWhen a 10-year-old boy gets a first class degree in mathematics or an 8-year-old boy plays chess like a future grand master, they are considered as geniuses. Where does the quality of genius come from? Is it all in the genes or can any child be turned into a genius? And if parents do have a child who might become a genius in the future, what should they do? In this 30-minute film, Barry Johnson, the professor at School of Medicine, New York University will help you discover the answer.\n10:00 PM----Science& Health\nIs it possible to beat high blood pressure without drugs? The answer is \"yes\", according to the researchers at Johns Hopkins and three other medical centers. After a study of 800 persons with high blood pressure, they found that after 6 months, those devoted to weight loss, exercise and eating a low-salt, low-fat food lost about 13 pounds and became fitter. Plus, 35% of them dropped into the \"normal\" category . This week, Dr. Alan Duckworth will tell you how these people reduce their blood pressure to a level similar to what's achieved with Hypertension  drugs."

      "With around 100 students scheduled to be in that 9:00 am Monday morning lecture, it is no surprise that almost 20 people actually make it to the class and only 10 of them are still awake after the first 15 minutes; it is not even a surprise that most of them are still in their pajama's . Obviously, students are terrible at adjusting their sleep cycles to their daily schedule.\nAll human beings possess a body clock. Along with other alerting systems, this governs the sleep/wake cycle and is therefore one of the main processes which govern sleep behaviour. Typically, the preferred sleep/wake cycle is delayed in adolescents, which leads to many students not feeling sleepy until much later in the evenings. This typical sleep pattern is usually referred to as the \"night owl\" schedule of sleep.\nThis is opposed to the \"early bird\" schedule, and is a kind of disorder where the individual tends to stay up much past midnight. Such a person has great difficulty in waking up in the mornings. Research suggests that night owls feel most alert and function best in the evenings and at night. Research findings have shown that about 20 percent of people can be _ as \"night owls\" and only 10 percent can be classified as \"early birds\" ------ the other 70 percent are in the middle. Although this is clearly not true for all students, for the ones who are true night owls, this gives them an excellent excuse for missing their lectures which unfortunately fall before midday."

      "Men spend more time getting ready to go out than women, according to research.\nOn average, men spend 81 minutes a day on personal preparing before going out, including cleansing(...), toning and using moisturizer , shaving, styling hair and choosing clothes, the study found, while women have their beauty preparation down to a fine art and get hair, clothes and make-up done in just 75 minutes.\nThe research, carried out for Travelodge, found that on an average morning men spend 23 minutes in the shower, compared to 22 minutes for women. Men then take 18 minutes on their shaving work, compared to 14 minutes for women despite them having to shave legs, armpits and bikini line. Men take a bit longer - 10 minutes - on cleansing, toning and using moisturizer.\nChoosing a proper outfit is also a time-consuming operation for men who want to look their best. They take 13 minutes to finish it, compared to 10 minutes for women.\nThe study also found that the average British person does not _ in terms of the true value of their washing bag. When quizzed, the average adult estimated their washing bag with contents to be worthPS52.23, while in reality the bag of essentials is worth nearly three times more at PS156.69.\nA spokeswoman for Travelodge said they had seen a rise in the number of washing bags being left behind in their 487 hotels. In the last 12 months, hotel staffs have spent hundreds of hours uniting 10,000 washing bags with their owners.\nIn one case, a customer paid more thanPS100 for a person to pick up her washing bag, which she had left behind in a London hotel - the designer washing bag had nearly PS1,000 worth of washing items."

      "It is evident that there is a close connection between the capacity to use language and the capacities covered by the verb \"to think\". Indeed, some writers have identified thinking with using words: Plato coined the saying, \"In thinking the soul is talking to itself\"; J. B. Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know. Presumably human beings have various capacities for thinking situations which are likewise independent of language."

      "Two new electronic book products (the SoftBook and the PocketBook) have gathered extensive press coverage, including articles in ABC News, the New York Times, San Jose Mercury News, and WIRED. \nAn electronic book (e-book) is a book-length publication in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices. Different from a traditional printed book, e-books are born digital. \nBeing a firm believer in tablet computers for many tasks not involving heavy data entry, I applaud these new designs of the products. In particular, the SoftBook has nice leather binding  , going far beyond the traditional (and boring) industrial design used for other portable computers. The PocketBook has a more traditional industrial design, typical of leading electronic gadgets  . \nUnfortunately, neither company mentions their product's screen resolution  . Low-resolution monitors (including all computer screens until now) have poor readability: people read about 25% slower from computer screens than from printed paper. Scientists believe that only the screen with 300 dpi displays has the same reading speed as print. So unless they have much better screens, electronic books will have a problem. \nA project called \"the last book\" is getting much attention, which aims at producing a computer in the form of a folio  : a set of pages using \"digital ink\". Users would move forward in the information by turning pages just as they do in a printed book. Hopefully, the scientists will eventually invent a way to make the \"digital ink\" display characters at a high enough resolution to gain the same reading speed as print. \nEven when e-books gain the same reading speed as print, they will still be a bad idea. Page turning remains a bad interface  , even when it can be done more conveniently than by clicking the mouse on a \"next page\" button. \nAnother problem is that most e-book publishers do not warn their customers about the real meaning of the digital rights management (DRM) tied to their products. Generally they claim that it is meant to prevent copying of the e-book. However, in many cases it is also possible that it will result in the complete denial of access by the purchaser to the e-book. The e-book is tied to a specific computer or device. In these cases, the DRM will usually let the purchaser move the book a limited number of times after which they cannot use it on any additional devices. If the purchaser upgrades or replaces their devices, they may lose access to their purchase. Some forms of the DRM depend on the existence of online services to authenticate   the purchasers. When the company that provides the service goes out of business or decides to stop providing the service, the purchaser will no longer be able to access the e-book."

      "Long, long ago there were a lot of donkeys. The donkeys worked hard every day. They had  no time to play or to relax, but they never felt appreciated for the work they did.\nOne day two donkeys got bored. They wanted to live a comfortable life. So the donkeys went  to see a wise old man. They told him their problem. The wise old man agreed that they worked too hard, and he wanted to help the donkeys. \"I have an idea.\" he said.\n\"What is your idea?\" asked the donkeys.\n\"I will paint you and no one will know you are donkeys,\" said the man.\nThe man went off to find some paint and he returned in just a matter of minutes. He had two  pots of paint. One pot was filled with white paint, and the other black paint.\nThe old man first painted them white,  and  then  painted  black  stripes  over the  white  paint.  When he finished, the donkeys did not look at all like donkeys.  \"You no longer look like  donkeys, \"  the old man said.   \" Everyone will be fooled.  I will call you something else,  zebras. \"\nThe zebras went to a field to eat grass. Now they did not have to work.\nSoon, other donkeys saw the zebras. They asked the zebras where they came from. When the ' zebras told the donkeys their secret, the donkeys all rushed to see the old man.\n\"Make us into zebras, too,\" they pleaded. So the wise old man painted more donkeys. As  he did, more and more donkeys came.\nThe old man could not paint fast enough. Soon the donkeys became impatient. They began to  kick about, and they knocked over the paint pots.\nThere was no more paint. The painted donkeys ran off to become zebras. The unpainted don- keys, because of their impatience, had to return to work.\nThis is ,why it is important to be patient."

      "Teenagers are more selfish than adults because they use different part of their brain to make decisions, new research suggests. Previous work has shown that when children reach puberty  , there is an increase in connections between nerves in the brain. This occurs particularly in the area involved in decision-making and awareness of other people's feelings, called the \"mentalising network\".\nNow Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist from the University College London, UK, has used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  to scan the brains of 19 adolescents (aged 11 to 17) and 11 adults (aged 21 to 37) while they were asked questions relating to decision-making. Questions such as: \"You're going to the cinema, where do you look for film times?\"\nBlakemore found that unlike adults, teenagers rely on the rear part of the mentalising network to make their decisions, an area of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in processing very basic behavioral actions while the front part, called prefrontal cortex, is involved in more complex functions such as processing how decisions affect others. The prefrontal cortex makes adults more able to understand the consequences of their actions.\nIn a separate experiment, Blakemore asked 112 participants (aged from 8 to 37) questions and timed how long it took them to respond. Questions such as: \"How would your friend feel if she wasn't invited to your party?\" She found that the response time got shorter as the participants got older, suggesting that the older people found it easier to put themselves in other people's shoes.\n\"Teenagers' brains are a work in progress and profoundly different from adults' brains. If you're making decisions about the responsibilities given to teenagers and how to treat teenagers in terms of the law, you need to take this new research into account,\" said Blakemore."

      "My father wasn't a king, he was a taxi driver, but I am a prince-Prince Renato II, of the country Pontinha, an island fort on Funchal harbour. It's in Madeira,Portugal, where I grew up. It was discovered in 1419.\nIn 1903, the king of Portugal sold the land to a wealthy British family, the Blandys, who make Madeira wine. Fourteen years ago the family decided to sell it forjust EUR25,000, but nobody wanted to buy it either. I met Blandy at a party. and he asked if I'd like to buy the island. Of course I said yes,but I had no money-I was just an art teacher.I tried to find some business partners, who all thought I was crazy.So I sold some of my possessions,put my savings together and bought it.Of course, my family. my friends-all thought I was mad.\nWhen the King originally sold the island,he signed a document, selling all the \"possessions and the dominions\"of the island.It means I can do what I want with it-I could start a restaurant, or a cinema but nobody thought someone would start a country.So that's what I did:I decided it would be my island, about the size of a one-bedroom house.\nI have both a Portuguese passport and one for Pontinha (where my passport number is 0001).There are four citizens: me, my wife, my son and my daughter.I am the police, the gardener,everything.I am whatever I want to be-that's the dream,isn't it?If l want to have a national flag,it could be blue today,red tomorrow.I can change it any time.Of course,my power is only absolute here, where I am the true sovereign.\nI don't live in my country full time, but I am often there.My family sometimes drops by, and other people come every day because the country is free for tourists to visit; I never close for bad weather.Sometimes I come here when I'm feeling lively,after a few drinks.\nMadeira is surrounded by water,but for some reason we all have to pay to swim in the ocean now,at the swimming spots.However.I have my island,which means I can come swimming whenever I want-it's as if someone has given me the key to the waters.\nOur lives are gone in a flash.All change in the world begins with something very small, and this is my country-just a small island."

      "Does style really sell? How can the appearance of a product be more important than what it does? The battle between form and function rose again when James Dyson, British inventor of the Dvson vacuum cleaner that has sold in millions around the world, resigned as chairman of London's Design Museum. It is widely believed that Mr. Dyson felt that the museum put too much stress on style at the expense of serious industrial design.\nMr. Dyson accused the museum of not keeping true to itself. He may be right, but these days, museums everywhere can no longer afford to be unique centers of scholarship and learning. Among competition for sponsorship, they must use exhibitions of populist culture, nice cafes and shops or, best of all, a new building by Frank Gehry to increase visitor numbers.\nOn the one hand, some producers can be too old-fashioned and too concerned with the importance of product engineering and the functionality of their goods. On the other hand, there are those who believe that how a product looks is more important. Design is indeed a broad term, involving both function and form. Typically, in any given product area, it changes from the former to the latter.  Clothing is a good example. But surely you would have to be a very shallow person to think something's appearance is more important than what it does.\nToday nearly all goods at any given price point do much the same job. So almost the  only way producers can differentiate their products from those of their competitors is to create some sort of emotional connection with the consumer, which could be through the visual appeal of the product or its packaging, or the imagery  created by advertising. And what of the Dyson vacuum cleaner? Mr. Dyson may believe that people buy these machines because of the graphs showing their superior suction, but most vacuum cleaners do a good job; the main reason people pay extra for a Dyson is that it is a vacuum cleaner with a fashionable  brand. With its inside workings exposed, it is a bit like a Richard Rogers building with all its pipes shown in bright colors on the outside instead of being hidden inside. Functional it may be, but it is a bit of a trick, too."

      "Have you ever been stuck for hours on a hard math problem? If you sat there for some time you might eventually solve it, but scientists say that daydreaming might be a much better way to tackle difficult tasks.\nIn fact, daydreaming has long been misunderstood. It's considered to be a bad thing and often associated with laziness. \"We're harsh   on ourselves if we catch ourselves mind wandering,\" says Professor Kalina Christoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada.\nBut the truth is that some of the most important scientific discoveries came about because scientists allowed their minds to wander. For example, Albert Einstein began his theory of relativity   when he daydreamed about riding a beam   of sunlight to the edge of the universe. And now, research has shown that normal people can also improve their problem-solving ability in the same way, reported The Telegraph.\nIn a study, 145 people aged between 19 and 32 were asked to list as many unusual uses as possible for everyday objects.  Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax - some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task.\nScientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues   in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease  .\nAfter the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before.\n\"People assume that when the mind wanders away it just gets turned off - but we show the opposite,\" explained Christoff. \"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a simpler task and let your mind\nAccording to Christoff, people typically   spend one-third of their waking time daydreaming. \"It's a big part of our lives, but it's been largely ignored by science.\""

      "For many years, I was sure that my suffering was because of my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts, and rejections with it.\nMany obese(overweight)people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix everything. Perhaps our worst mistake is believing that being thin means being loved, being special, and being cherished. We imagine what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal. We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there.\nBut we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally realize its promise of happiness, and of course, love.\nIt took me a long while to know that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards are different with culture. In Somoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us try hard to change our body, but with no result. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes toward ourselves,  the whole world changes."

      "A 400-pound adult male gorilla   escaped from his cage at the Buffalo Zoo on Monday. He bit a female zookeeper before being caught. The 24-year-old gorilla came out of his living quarters through an unlocked door on Monday morning. He ran into the space which was used by zoo workers but closed to the public.\nA keeper who has cared for Koga since he arrived in 2007 was bitten on her hand and leg. Zoo officials said it was an act of excitement. \"He was probably just as surprised coming face to face with her as she was with him,\" Buffalo Zoo President Donna Fernandes said.\nThe keeper took refuge   inside the habitat of a female gorilla and her newborn baby. The keeper's decision to lock herself inside the separate habitat likely kept her from being further harmed. The keeper had a good relationship with the mother who, like Koga, is a west lowland gorilla, native to West Africa and the Congo River Basin, according to Fernandes.\nSeveral locked doors prevented Koga from running wildly through the zoo and beyond. The police sent in a team to make sure the area was safe while a vet   used a pipe to sedate (......) Koga. The gorilla was dragged by the zoo staff back to his cage once the drugs took hold.\nVisitors to the zoo were moved indoors and stayed there for about 45 minutes while the team was trying to catch the gorilla and send it back to his cage. \"That was the scariest thing I've ever done in my career,\" said the team's captain Mark Maraschiello. \"It's a 400-pound gorilla. Nobody knew what harm he could do to us. He could have bitten my arm off easily,\" Maraschiello added."

      "Like many of my generation, I have a weakness for hero worship. At some point, however, we all begin to question our heroes and our need for them. This leads us to ask: What is a hero?\nDespite immense differences in cultures, heroes around the world generally share a number of characteristics that instruct and inspire people.\nA hero does something worth talking about. A hero has a story of adventure to tell and community who will listen. But a hero goes beyond mere fame.\nHeroes serve powers or principles larger than themselves. Like high-voltage transformers, heroes take the energy of higher powers and step it down so that it can be used by ordinary people.\nThe hero lives a life worthy of imitation. Those who imitate a genuine hero experience life with new depth, enthusiasm, and meaning. A sure test for would-be heroes is what or whom do they serve? What are they willing to live and die for? If the answer or evidence suggests they serve only their own fame, they may be famous persons but not heroes. Madonna and Michael Jackson are famous, but who would claim that their fans find life more abundant?\nHeroes are catalysts   for change. They have a vision from the mountaintop. They have the skill and the charm to move the masses. They create new possibilities. Without Gandhi, India might still be part of the British Empire. Without Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr., we might still have segregated   buses, restaurants, and parks. It may be possible for large-scale change to occur without leaders with magnetic personalities, but the pace of change would be slow, the vision uncertain, and the committee meetings endless."

      "Most young people enjoy some form of physical activity. It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind: football, hockey, golf, or tennis. It may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and steep mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women are willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountains? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport, not a game. There are no man-made rules, as there are for such games as tennis and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind which it would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man-made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering and other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"team sport\". Then we are mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock surface linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nA mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. This sport requires high mental and physical qualities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve his skills year after year. A skier is probably past his best by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skills than waste less effort."

      "For years and years people have been saying that the railways are dead. \" We can do without railways.\" People say...as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying .But this is far from the truth: in these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you up as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams, and a single train carry goods which a plane or a motorcar could never do.\nFar from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep in comfort, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at speed at the same time? And we are only at the beginning, for we have just entered the age of super-fast trains, trains traveling at 150 miles an hour and more. Soon we will be wondering why we spent so much on motorcars we can't use because we have not enough money to buy the oil and planes we can't fly for the same reason.."

      "Chuck Berry, the man often called the \"father of rock and roll\" is still performing at 85. Another music great, Smokey Robinson, has described Chuck Berry as \"the inspiration for all of today's rock 'n' roll guitarists.\" And, Anthony Kiedis calls him \"a musical scientist who discovered a cure for the blues.\"\n   On stage, he became known for his wild performances, and his \"duck walk\" that many musicians copied. But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n   Chuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal. He was born the fourth of six children. He started singing in church when he was six years old. His interest in music stuck with him. \n    A lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life, especially school. Chuck Berry and two friends were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car . He was released from prison four years later. But that would not be the last of his legal problems over the years.\nFilmmaker Taylor Hackford made a documentary called \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986. More than seventy-five artists and bands have done their own versions of Chuck Berry songs. Many have done several, including the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, included Chuck Berry in its first year of honors in 1986. The Hall of Fame had this to say: \"While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together.\""

      "Planted for their fragrance and beauty, roses historically have been the center of much praise and are one of the most universal symbols of love and life. As the phrase goes, sometimes you do have to \"stop and smell the roses\".\nAlthough you may think that this is just a fancy way of saying taking some time to enjoy life, perhaps we have dismissed roses for too long. Seriously, you should pay more attention to those roses. They could greatly improve your life. That is, if you are one of the millions of people in the US who suffer from arthritis diseases.\nResult from two different arthritis studies have proved that an active ingredient of rose hips has been shown to protect and possibly rebuild joint tissue broken down by arthritis. The latest results, presented at the World Conference in Rome showed that protein GOPO(R) found in rose hips can protect vulnerable cartilage . GOPO(R) has also been shown to improve mood, increase energy and sleep quality of those affected by arthritis. Marked by stiffness, swelling, loss of flexibly and pain, arthritis can significantly stop one from a normal life.\n\"We have little doubt that certain rose hip preparations, and GOPO(R) in particular, have had an important role to play in reducing the pain and disability caused by arthritis,\" said Winther.\nWith the aid of this new research, those affected by joint pain caused by arthritis could choose an alternative treatment than pain killers. \"We suspect that more people will be turning to the power of rose-hip for joint pain relief,\" said Winther.\nSorry Shakespeare, but in this case, no other rose could smell as sweet."

      "I am a psychologist. I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.\nWhat if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.\nPlay, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.\nExperts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality."

      "Located on Turkey's famous, 500 km Lycian Way arid only accessible by water,the 86,000 sqm Butterfly Valley is home to roughly 100 species of butterflies,including the orange,black and white Jersey Tiger.\nThe Turkish government named the valley a preservation area in 1987 to protect the butterflies and local plants-a distinction that lias protected the valley from the fate of its better-known neighbour,Oludeniz,a beach resort 5 km north.\nOludeniz remained actually unknown until travellers began camping there in the 1980s. Today,it's a particularly depressing example of paradise lost .The town is filled with neon lights and English-themed restaurants.The beach is crowded with drunken,sunburned tourists,and the clear skies are polluted with seemingly infinite paraglider from the surrounding green mountains.\nIn contrast,the Anatolia Tourism Development Cooperative bought Butterfly Valley from the villagers of Faralya in 1981 and opened it for tourism in 1984.Three years later,when the government deemed the valley a national preservation area,the Cooperative made the construction of permanent buildings illegal.\nToday,they allow only tents and small houses,and they've focused on natural growth as opposed to commercial.Plants,like olives,pomegranates,lemons,oranges,grapes,walnuts,peaches,apricots,palm,oleander and laurel,all thrive here.\nFor eight months a year-between April and Novembera small and diverse group of hippies and backpackers come over to the valley,where days are marked by sunrise and sunset yoga practices and evenings by music sessions. Once mid-afternoon hits,after the few tour boats are gone for the day,Butterfly Valley belongs to those who are willing to spend the night under the stars,living wonderfully free of the more luxurious conveniences of Oludeniz."

      "People have been listening to music to get in the mood for hundreds of years. Recently, there is scientific research to _ what we have always known about music. The studies have shown that when people are excited or happy they are more helpful. The opposite happens when people feel aggressive  or under stress. The use of music can influence how helpful people can be.\nDr Adrian North made a study with 256 university students. Half the group took exercise in the gymnasium listening to music which can bring happiness and the other half exercised to aggressive music. When leaving the gym, the students were asked to hand out flyers   in support of the local disabled athlete's foundation.\nThe results showed that nearly half of the group that listened to happy music were willing to hand out flyers. But in the group that heard the aggressive music, less than 20% were willing. This study suggests that our choice of music can influence our willingness to cooperate .\nWhile a study also shows that productivity   can increase with the right choice of background music in the workplace. As music stimulates   workers' minds, job satisfaction is often positively influenced. Other studies have shown that workers who are in a good mood report more job satisfaction than those in a bad mood.\nThese studies show that music can have a powerful influence on a person's ability to cooperate. Moods have a direct influence on cooperation and job satisfaction, etc. These factors also have a direct relationship to the success of a business."

      "Is technology making us unhealthy? Are computers affecting our health? Many people think high--tech products have affected us because we spend more time playing on computers, watching TV and using our mobile phones to talk, text and play games.\nOur bodies: Levels of obesity are rising, especially young children. But this isn't just a problem about what we eat. Many people, especially teenagers, like sitting in front of TV sets or computers for hours, just watching or playing games. As a result, they do less exercise.\nOur brains: Research into the effects on the human brain while playing computer games is ongoing. Recent studies have looked at the impact on beta brainwave activity, which is important for emotional development, planning and self-control. Though we haven't evidence to show how it affects us, researchers think that tiredness may affect the levels of beta brainwave activity, and sitting in front of a TV set or computer for a long time easily causes one to feel tired. So parents who don't want to spoil their children's fun should control the time they spend on the computer.\nCommunication: As leading computer game consumers, are we spending too much time in front of computers? Does it mean that we spend less time communicating with other people? What effect does this have on our lives?\nIt certainly seems that children today are spending more time indoors than their parents did when they were young. Children used to play in the streets or in parks regularly. Today, empty parks clearly show how \"play time\" has changed because of advances in affordable technology like home computers."

      "Today our lives are changing faster than at any time in history. Here we report on three important changes that will have a big impact on our everyday lives in the future.\nThe cashless society\nCash and bank-notes will disappear almost completely. They will be replaced by smart cards, namely plastic cards: microchip processors loaded with some money. When we pay for goods,the shop assistant will put our smart card into a payment terminal and money will come into his card from our card. When all the money is used up,we will be able to reloadit by putting it into a telephone,dialing our bank account and money will be put into the card from the account.\nInteractive telephones\nTalking computers will play an important part. They will recognize speech, ask us what information we need, look through a database,and put the information into speech.If we want to book a flight or pay a bill by phone, we will interact with a talking computer to do so. Human telephone operators will be used only for more complex operations such as dealing with complaints or solving special problems.\nTraffic jams in cities will be reduced because drivers will use electronic route maps to find the quickest route to their destination. Electronic systems will start changing motorists for driving in cities.As soon as motorists have to pay to drive in cities, they will stop using their cars and use public transport instead. Speed control systems will be built into cars. These systems will automatically regulate the speed of the car to take account of traffic and weather conditions and prevent accidents. It will be many years before these changes bring results but when they do,there will be a _ improvement in road safety.\nWith the development of science and technology, more and more advanced things will be invented or created. Life in the future is undoubtedly different from that at the present."

      "When movie star Scarlett Johansson was photographed naming in Los Angeles recently, she attracted a lot of attention; for the 27-year-old actress was wearing Vibram FiveFingers, so called because they look more like gloves than shoes, with a space for each toe.\nStrange though they may look, these so-called barefoot shoes, which reproduce the effect of barefoot running but with less pain, are just one brand in a range of minimalist footwear. These super-thin sports shoes are causing a stir in the world of running and fitness. Why? Because some experts believe _ could make you a better, more efficient runner and that traditional trainers could be doing you more harm than good.\n\"Wearing a shoe that has lots of cushioning and support affects the way your body naturally moves and studies suggest that this carries a higher risk of injury,\" explains Matt Wallden, an athlete performance expert. \"But with barefoot shoes, the foot can actually feel the firmness and shape of the ground, which allows your body to respond effectively.'\"\nBut before you rush out to invest in minimalist footwear, be careful. These kinds of shoes are not meant for everyone, or at least not straight away.\n\"Ordinary sports shoes with support are good for beginners whose bodies are not used to the impact of running,\" explains Patrick Davoren, former Olympic athlete. \"If you are not in great condition, then running in minimalist footwear may cause injuries and will turn a lot of people off exercise and running.\nIf you are currently injured, and figures show that in any given year 65% of all runners are, it can be tempting to try anything that promises to get you back on the road, trail, or beach. But barefoot running is not a method of treating injury nor is it a magical way of suddenly turning you into a great athlete.\nEven if you're used to running, when you start using minimalist shoes you should build up your distance gradually. Start _ off'by doing just 10% of what you'd normally run and increase the distance by no more than 10% every week. And a word of warning - you may never have soft feet again"

That's the idea behind Six Items or Less.\nSix Items or Less is a social experiment , a gentle way of saying \"no\" to fashion consumerism  and the high cost of clothing . Heidi Hackemer came up with the idea . She shared their idea with her friends . And all of a sudden , they had almost 100 people from around the world saying that they wanted to take part in this experiment .\nIt was an interesting month for them . Hackemer was surprised at how few people noticed that she was wearing the same six items the whole month .

Then she eventually accepted it and started to be more relaxed . \nAlexander was one of the 40 men \"sixers\". The most difficult part for him was having to wash clothes by hand every day . But the experiment changed his opinion on what makes people happy . \"We have many choices for everything . But all those choices don't necessarily lead up to any kind of satisfaction .

      "Planning your holiday? Whether you're going to Yunnan or UK, it's important to make sure you're well-prepared. Here's a handy checklist to help you.\nLocation\nThe first thing you have to decide is where you want to go. Of course a lot will depend on your time and budget. Do you want to relax on a beach, visit some famous landmarks, or hike through some beautiful scenery? All these things are available in China, but if your budget stretches, why not look at somewhere else in Asia, or even farther.\nPacking\nThere can be such a thing as being over prepared when traveling, but you don't want to forget something important. It can be a good idea to wear pants with zipped pockets. In certain countries local thieves will target unsuspecting tourists for their money. It can also be worth packing some basic medical supplies. If you are going to be moving around a lot, buy a good backpack. Finally, remember to pack clothes that are going to be suitable for the weather.\nAccommodation\nThere are several things to consider when picking where you want to stay. Location is often the most important. When staying in hotels, it is often a good idea to book your first night in a new city. After all, you will not be familiar with the surroundings and will want somewhere to leave your luggage. However, don't spend more than a couple of days at the same hotel. When you get to a new place, you might soon discover there's somewhere better to stay.\nDon't forget\nThe key to a good holiday is detail. When you're traveling, especially in a foreign country, don't forget to change some money before you leave. If you're traveling somewhere tropical, you might need some injections or pills to avoid disease. And it's always worth taking out travel insurance, just in case you find yourself in a spot of bother during the trip. Don't forget to check the exchange rates. The strong yuan has made traveling abroad cheaper recently. It can also be a good idea to write down the phone number of the closest Chinese embassy, in case you need help while abroad."

      "What do a l5-year-old high school student named Vogt and Thomas Paine have in common? The answer is that both inspired major changes in their societies by writing an essay. In October,a student at west Milford high school in New Jersey read an article in her local newspaper that disturbed her. The article reported that the board of education had decided to use  _ tray in the lunchroom because they were less expensive than paper one's.\n    Vogt knew from her science class that polystyrene can have harmful effects on the environment in the first place. It is not biodegradable,meaning that it can't be broken down by natural biological processes. in addition,some polystyrene products give off gases called chloroflulrocarbons(CFCs)into the air. Scientific evidence indicates that these CFCs break down the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere. \n    Vogt decided to write a paper for her social studies class on the issue of polystyrene. Her teacher, Carl Stehle,read her paper to the class. After reminding students that Thomas Paine had had to persuade many hesitant colonists  to support the American Revolution,Stehle challenged his class to do something about the polystyrene problem. \n    Vogt and her classmates immediately conducted a survey in the high school and middle school . They discovered that a large majority of students said they wanted to switch back to paper goods in the cafeteria. When they presented their findings to the board of education,the boards business administrator did a survey of his own. He found that roughly 80 percent of the students in the two schools would be willing to pay extra 5 cents to eat their lunch from paper trays. As a result,the board voted in December to change to paper trays in all the townships schools."

      "Do you realize that every time you take a step, the bones in your hip are subjected to forces between four and five times your body weight? When you are running, this force is increased further still. What happens if through disease a hip-joint ceases to be able to resist such forces? For many years hip-joints and other body joints have been replaceable either partially or completely. It is after all a simple ball and socket joint; it has certain loads imposed on it; it needs reliability over a defined life; it must contain materials suitable for the working environment. Any engineer will recognize these as characteristic of a typical engineering problem, which doctors and engineers have worked together to solve, in order to bring a fresh lease of life to people who would otherwise be disabled.\nThis typifies the way in which engineers work to help people and create a better quality of life. The fact that this country has the most efficient agricultural industry in the world is another good example. Mechanical engineers have worked with farmers and biologists to produce fertilizers, machinery and harvesting systems. This team effort has now produced crops uniformly waist high or less so that they are better suited to mechanical harvesting. Similar advances with other crops have released people from hard and boring jobs for more creative work, whilst machines harvest crops more efficiently with less waste. Providing more food for the rapidly increasing population is yet another role for the mechanical engineer."

      "Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a stricter nationwide health standard for smog-causing pollutants that would bring substantial benefits to millions of Americans. With a final rule expected by the end of this month, some opponents, mainly from industrial and oil-producing states, are pushing back. They say investments required to produce cleaner air are too expensive and not scientifically justified.\nLisa Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, needs to stick to her guns. This is only the first of several political tests to come this fall, as she also seeks to tighten rules governing individual pollutants like mercury and global warming gases like carbon dioxide.\nThe health standard she is proposing covers ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog, which is formed when sunlight mixes with pollutants from factories, refineries, power plants and automobiles. Ozone is a major health threat, contributing to heart disease and various respiratory   problems.\nMs. Jackson's proposal--to reduce the permitted level of smog in the air from the current 75 parts per billion to between 60 parts per billion and 70 parts per billion--is sensible, no matter what industry's defenders may claim. It had been recommended by the agency's independent scientific panel but rejected by the Bush administration, which proposed a weaker standard.\nIndustry will have to make investments in cleaner power plants, and new technologies may be required. As it is, about half the counties that monitor ozone levels are not yet in compliance with current standards, let alone the proposed standard.\nFears about burdening industry raised by critics like George Voinovich, a Republican of Ohio, and Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, cannot be dismissed out of hand, especially in the middle of a recession  . But the health benefits, E.P.A. says, far outweigh the costs, and the time frame for compliance   is generous."

Irish-born Campbell and Japanese Omura won half of the prize for discovering a new drug, avermectin, that has helped the battle against river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing effectiveness against other parasitic diseases. The Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, an 85-year-old female scientist, was awarded the other half of the prize for the discovery of artemisinin , a drug cure for malaria  that has saved millions of lives all over the world, especially in the developing world.\nWhen the news broke that Tu won the Nobel Prize, there were cheers as well as doubts. It also has highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the West. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it was unfair to award the prize only to Tu. Indeed, Chinese science awards are mainly presented to projects, instead of individual scientists. But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method. Li Zhenzhen, a researcher of the China Academy of Sciences said that the West believes that the advancement of science comes from individuals' creative minds.\nIn 1969, Tu started to hold a government project aimed at eliminating malaria. Tu and her teammates experimented with 380 extracts in 2,000 candidate recipes before they finally succeeded in getting the pure substance qinghaosu, later known as artemisinin.

She says,\"I like to see what's on the other side of the hill.\" She has gone almost everywhere to do that.\nIn 1988,at the age of 50,she became the first woman to travel alone to the North Pole. She pulled her own sled   piled with 160 pounds of supplies,and during her trip no one brought her fresh supplies. Accompanied   only by her dog Charlie,she survived cold weather and meetings with polar bears. In fact,Charlie saved her life when one of them attacked her. Near the end of her trip,a forceful wind blew away the majority of her supplies. The last week of the trip,she survived on a handful of nuts and a little water each day.\nHelen goes to challenging places not only for adventure,but also for education. Before her Arctic journey,she started a website called Adventure Classroom. On the site,she shares her adventures in order to motivate   students. She explains,\"Although kids often see the world in a negative way,without hope for their future,we work to inspire them to set goals,plan for success and never give up...\"\nHelen grew up in New Zealand. Her parents were athletes and mountain climbers. Following her parents' example,she climbed her first mountain at 9. Later,she climbed the highest mountains in North and South America,the former USSR and New Zealand.\nIn 1996,she took on another challenge--the Sahara Desert. She and her husband,Bill,walked 2,400 miles across it!In 2001,she and Bill traveled on foot from west to east through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. They hope to travel in mainland China into Sichuan and Tibet to study pandas this year.\nHelen plans to continue taking trips.

      "Every Sunday morning I take a jog around a park near my home. There's a lake located in one comer of the park. Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water's edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.\nThis past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush.\n\"Hello,\" I said.  \"I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don't mind my nosiness , I'd love to know what you're doing with these turtles.\"\n\"I'm cleaning off their shells,\" she replied.  \"Anything on a turtle's shell, like algae , reduces the turtle's ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim. It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.\"\n\"Wow!  That's really nice of you!\" I exclaimed.\nShe went on, \"I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It's my own strange way of making a difference.\"\n\"But don't most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?\" I asked.\n\"Yes, sadly, they do,\" she replied.\nI scratched my head. \"Well, don't you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don't have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense... but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?\"\nThe woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, \"Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he'd tell you I just made all the difference in the world.\""

      "I'm a pig, and my son is a rabbit. I have snakes for daughters, and my wife, believe it or not, is a dragon! Do I live in a zoo? No, of course not! I am talking about Chinese zodiac signs . Depending on the year of your birth, each person has an animal for a sign. That's why I am a pig and my wife is a dragon. If you, like me, were born in the year of the pig, then you are brave, thoughtful and loyal. The year of the pig is filled with good fortune.\nNow let's take a closer look at this interesting animal.\nPigs were first raised by man about 9,000 years ago, and are still a very common farm animal in many parts of the world. We don't just use pigs for their meat -- almost every part of the animal is used. The hair is used for artists' brushes. The fat is used to make floor wax, rubber and plastics.\nPigs have also been important in the world of entertainment. In 1995 the film 'Babe' starred a loveable talking pig as its main character. The film won an Oscar and was nominated  for 6 more. In England you can even go to watch pig racing. A farmer, Rob Shepherd, has been raising money for charity by holding pig races on his farm. The events have been very successful. People don't just want to eat pigs, it seems!\nPigs also play an important role in the English language. For example, if someone says that he will travel to the sun one day, you can say \" _ !\" to him. Hungry? Well then, you can \"pig out\" and eat lots of food. And what if someone rescues you? Well, you can say that they \"saved your bacon\"."

      "For most people, shopping is still a matter of wandering down the street or loading a cart in a shopping mall.Soon, that will change.Electronic commerce (trade) is growing fast and will soon bring people more choices.There will, however, be a cost: protecting the consumer from being cheated will be harder.Many governments therefore want to apply street regulations to the electronic world.But politicians would be wiser to see cyberspace as a basis for a new era of corporate self-regulation.\nConsumers in rich countries have grown used to the idea that the government takes responsibility for everything for the stability of the banks to the safety of the drugs or their rights to refund when goods are faulty.But governments cannot enforce national laws on businesses whose only presence is on the screen.Even in a country where a clear right to compensation exists, the on-line customer in Tokyo, say, can hardly go to New York to get a refund for a clothes purchase.\nOne answer is for government to cooperate more: to recognize each other's  rules.But that requires years of work and volumes of detailed rules.And plenty of countries have rules too fanciful for sober countries to accept.There is, however, another choice.Let the electronic businesses do the regulation themselves.They do, after all, have a self-interest in doing so.\nIn electronic commerce, a reputation for honest dealing will be a valuable competitive asset.Governments, too, may compete to be trusted.For instance, customers ordering medicines on-line may prefer to buy from the United States because they trust the rigorous screening of the Food and Drug Administration; or they may decide that the FDA's rules are too strict, and buy from Switzerland instead.\nCustomers will still need to use their judgment.But precisely because the technology is new, electronic shoppers are likely for a while to be a lot more cautious than customers of the normal sort.And the new technology will also make it easier for them to complain when a company lets them down.In this way, at least, the advent of cyberspace may argue for fewer consumer protection laws, not more."

      "Before the print was brought to England in 1476, everything was written by hand. The few people who knew how to write were trained in schools set up by the church. Those who made a living by writing for other people were called scribes . \nThe work of scribes was not easy. Much of it had to be done fast in order to meet the needs of the King. the church and traders. Most of the writing was in Latin  ,but some of it was in the English of the day. And no one was quite sure how some English words should be spelled.\nOne problem was that several letters were written with short vertical strok that all looked like each other. Among them were the letters , i, u, v, m and n, Thus .five straight lines in a row might stand for uni nui uvi or mii.\nAs a result .reading was sometimes difficult, especially when the writing was done in a hurry.\nThe scribes solved the problem in part, by changing the letter u to o when it came before m. n or v. This is how sum and cum came to be written as some and come.\nAt some point, too, the scribes seemed to have decided that no English word should be ended by u or v. Thus, in time an e was added to such words as live, have, due and true. It was added, but not pronounced."

      "At one time, people used to travel to foreign countries because they thought they would be different from home--the building, the food, the national dress. Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.\nWhat, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome."

I have clothes on the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known it yesterday, I had a late breakfast, and it looks like rain.\" And my personal favorite response: \" _ .\" She died a few years ago. We never did have lunch together. From then on, I've tried to be a little more flexible.\nLife has a way of going faster as we get older. The days get shorter, and the list of promises made to ourselves gets longer. One morning, we awaken, and all have to show for our lives is repetition of \"I'm going to\" , \"I plan on\" and \"Someday, when things are settled down a bit.\"\nWhen anyone calls my \"seize the moment\" friend, she is open to adventure and available for trips. She keeps an open mind on new ideas. Her enthusiasm for life is _ . You talk with her for five minutes, and you're ready to trade your bad feet for a pair of Rollerblades and skip an elevator for a bungee cord.\nMy lips have not touched ice cream in 10 years.

As he left his house, he thought of everything that he needed to buy, made a list, and then got into his car. As he began to drive, his mind came to the fight that he had with his girlfriend. When he finally began to focus back on his driving, it was just a moment too late.

Strong arms began to pull him out and he saw a woman who was screaming. A stranger handed a child to her and the child was injured. Afterwards, they were taken to the hospital.\nBy chance, he was in a room on the same floor as the mother and child. For the first time in his life, he was truly sorry. He made his way to their room, looked at the upset mother straight in the eye and said simply, \"Please forgive me and I didn't mean for this to happen.\" The woman stood there, completely shocked, and said, \"It took a lot of courage for you to ask for forgiveness, and my daughter is always saying to me to just forgive and forget. I will give you forgiveness.\"\nJason began to cry, and not knowing what to do, he threw his arms around the mother of the injured girl and told her that he would do anything they needed. To make it easier for him, the woman told him her and her daughter's names. Then they sat there and talked for hours, watching her daughter sleep.

      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) founded on January 1, 1994, aims to encourage international trade to flow as freely as possible, making sure that trade agreements are respected and that any disputes   can be settled.\nIn the five years since its founding, the WTO has become well-known as one of the world's most powerful economic organizations, taking its place alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe system of global rules for international trade, however, dates back half a century to 1948 when the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade (GATT) was formed after World War II.\nAs time went by it became clear that the GATT had two major _ --the limited areas of trade it covered, and the lack of an effective system to settle disputes.\nAfter seven years of trade talks ending in 1994. the so-called Uruguay Round finally gave birth to the WTO, complete with an effective system to settle disputes and new rules covering trade in services and intellectual property  .\nEven after seven years of talks and 22500 pages of agreements there were still problems, especially the difficult-to-deal-with areas of agriculture and services.\nThe WTO. with its head office in Geneva, has 135 members with 30 more waiting to join."

      "Cleverness is a gift while kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy--they're given after all. Choices can be hard.\nI got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that the Internet usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year. I told my wife Mac kenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most start-ups don't and I wasn't sure what to expect. Mac kenzie told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor. I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.\nI was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, \"That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.\" That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it was really a difficult choice, but finally, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. _ \nAfter much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice. For all of us, in the end, we are our choice."

      "In only two decades Asian Americans have become the fastest growing U. S. minority. As their children began moving up through the nation schools, it became clear that a new class of academic achievers was emerging. Their achievements are reflected in the nation's best universities, where mathematics, science and engineering departments have taken on a decidedly Asian character. This special liking for mathematics and science is partly explained by the fact that Asian-American students who began their education abroad arrived in the U. S. with a solid grounding in mathematics but little or no knowledge of English. They are also influenced by the promise of a good job after college. Asians feel there will be less unfair treatment in areas like mathematics and science because they will be judged more objectively. And the return on the investment in education is more immediate in something like engineering than with an arts degree.\nMost Asian-American students owe their success to the influence of parents who are determined that their children take full advantage of what the American educational system has to offer. An effective measure of parental attention is homework. Asian parents spend more time with their children than American parents do, and it helps. Many researchers also believe there is something in Asian culture that breeds success, such as ideals that stress family values and emphasize education.\nBoth explanations for academic success worry Asian Americans because of fears that they feed a typical racial image. Many can remember when Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants were the victims of social isolation. Indeed, it was not until 1952 that laws were laid down giving all Asian immigrants the right to citizenship."

      "Geoffery Payne talked for the first time about the night when his wife was killed. The judge thought it was he who killed his wife. Now he wrote to a magazine from the prison about what had happened on the night of 13 October, 2007.\nI had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11 p.m. I drove home slowly because the weather was terrible- the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was turning into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was frightened and the man looked frightened, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was strange.\nWhen I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.\nI was still very upset about what had happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars  . When I went to close the window, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over and felt her pulse but she was dead. I sat on the floor beside her body. I was too frightened to do anything.\nWhen I gained a bit of consciousness, the sky was getting light. I couldn't remember a thing about the night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived about half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to recall what had happened the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man on the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? Why did he look so frightened? Why did he run away?"

      "IT'S a mystery that has puzzled scientists. Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea."

      "Can you imagine a world without chocolate? It's not something I'd like to do, so I was relieved to read that there's a university with a programme to safeguard the future of chocolate!\nThe University of Reading, in England, has just opened a new clearing house for all the world's new cocoa varieties. They must be quarantined   before they can be grown. Why? Cocoa production hit a record high of 4.4 million tons last year but about 30% of the precious crop is regularly lost to pests and diseases. Now we don't want that, do we?\nDemand for chocolate has been increasing faster than the world supply of cocoa and researchers think that new varieties are key to solving this problem.\nThe University of Reading has been protecting the quality of the new crop since 1985, after it took over the task from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, London. And it has improved its facilities. The leader of the institution's cocoa project, Professor Paul Hadley, says, \"One of the main issues concerning cocoa improvement is the supply of reliably clean, healthy, interesting cocoa material.\"\nThe cocoa centre has a collection of 400 plant varieties and their greenhouse uses a lot of energy to keep them in tropical conditions. After up to two years in quarantine, clean and safe seeds are sent to some 20 countries, including several in West Africa. That's where 75% of the cocoa used for chocolate worldwide comes from. The crop is extremely important for the local economy: it employs about two million people.\nProfessor Paul Hadley says he works with a small team of skilled technicians who look after the collection. And more of us seem to count on them now.\nThe scientist says, \"There is some concern within the industry that demand is increasing constantly, particularly in countries like China, where the standard of living is increasing and people are getting a taste for different chocolates.\""

The answer may not be as simple as you think.\nTipping, psychologists have found, is not just about service. Instead, studies have shown that tipping can be affected by psychological reactions to a series of different factors from the waiter's choice of words, to how they carry themselves while taking orders, to the bill's total. Even how much waiters remind customers of themselves can determine how much change they pocket by the end of the night.\n\"Studies before have shown that mimicry   brings into positive feelings for the mimicker,\" wrote Rick van Baaren, a social psychology professor. \"These studies show that people who are being mimicked become more generous toward the person who mimics them.\"\nSo Rick van Baaren divided 59 waiters into two groups. He requested that half serve with a phrase such as, \"Coming up!\" Those in the other half were instructed to repeat the orders and preferences back to the customers. Rick van Baaren then compared their take-home. The results were clear -- it pays to mimic your customer. The copycat  waiters earned almost double the amount of tips to the other group.\nLeonard Green and Joel Myerson, psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis, found the generosity of a tipper may be limited by his bill. After research on the 1,000 tips left for waiters, cabdrivers, hair stylists, they found tip percentages in these three areas dropped as customers' bills went up. In fact, tip percentages appear to plateau   when bills topped $100 and a bill for $200 made the worker gain no bigger percentage tip than a bill for $100.\n\"That's also a point of tipping,\" Green says. \"You have to give a little extra to the cab driver for being there to pick you up and something to the waiter for being there to serve you. If they weren't there, you'd never get any service. So part of the idea of a tip is for just being there.\""

      "Who is more stressed out--the Asian teenager or the American teenager? Surprise! The American teen wins this match.According to a recent study, almost three quarters of American high school students said they felt stress at least once a week, some almost every day.Fewer than half of Japanese and Taiwanese eleventh grade students reported feeling stress that often.\nThe phenomenon of stress is the constant interaction   between mind and body.And the influence of one upon the other can be either positive or negative.What can the mind do to the body? Studies have proved that watching funny movies can reduce pain and promote healing  .On the contrary worry can give a person an  _ , high blood pressure, or even a heart attack.\nThe mind and body work together to produce stress, which is a response to a stimulus  , a response that disturbs the body's normal physiological   balance.However, stress is not always bad.For example, a stress reaction can sometimes save a person's life by producing hormones   that make it possible for a person to react quickly and with greater energy in a dangerous situation.In everyday situations, too, stress can provide that extra push needed to do something difficult.But too much stress often injures both the mind and the body.How can stress be kept under control? Learn to Lighten Up and Live Longer, the best-seller of the month, has several good suggestions.So, get a copy and start learning how you can reduce stress in your life."

      "The Pacific island nation of Nauru used to be a beautiful place. Now it is an ecological disaster area. Nauru's heartbreaking story could have one good consequence -- other countries might learn from its mistakes.\nFor thousands of years, Polynesian people lived the remote island of Nauru, far from western civilization. The first European to arrive was John Fearn in 1798. He was the British captain of the Hunter, a whaling ship. He called the island Pleasant Island.\nHowever, because it was very remote, Nauru had little communication with Europeans at first. The whaling ships and other traders began to visit, bringing guns and alcohol. These elements destroyed the social balance of the twelve family groups on the island. A ten-year civil war started, which reduced the population from 1,400 to 900.\nNauru's real troubles began in 1899 when a British mining company discovered phosphate  on the island. In fact, it found that the island of Nauru was nearly all phosphate, which a very important fertilizer for farming. The company began mining the phosphate.\nA phosphate mine is not a hole in the ground; it is a strip mine. When a company strip-mines, it removes the top layer of soil. Then it takes away the material it wants. Strip mining totally destroys the land. Gradually, the lovely island of Nauru started to look like the moon.\nIn 1968, Nauru became one of the richest countries in the world. Every year the government received millions and millions of dollars for its phosphate.\nUnfortunately, the leaders invested the money unwisely and lost millions of dollars. In addition, they used millions more dollars for personal expenses. Soon people realized that they had a terrible problem -- their phosphate was running out. Ninety percent of their island was destroyed and they had nothing. By 2000, Nauru was financially ruined. Experts say that it would take approximately $433,600,000 and more than 20 years to repair the island. This will probably never happen."

      "When we walk on a street or sit down to have a cup of coffee in a small cafe in Shanghai, we will often see foreign faces at every turn. Today, foreigners do not come to Shanghai to seek adventures, as they did in the old days, or arrive in the city for a short visit, as some did when China just carried out the opening-up. Instead, many foreigners come to Shanghai to settle in the city. They are attracted by the life in Shanghai and choose to stay in the city. Their stay has made Shanghai more like an international city.\nEarly in the 1990s, a group of Western-style buildings _ at the Gubei New District in the southwestern part of the Hongqiao Development Zone in Shanghai. The Western-style buildings, marked by their great arches and the typical flavors of the unique European style, appealed to many foreigners and become their favorite choice when they came to live or work in Shanghai. Foreigners gathered in the zone, enjoying their quiet life there.\nAs the city further develops, more and more foreigners choose to live in the downtown area where most native Shanghai people live. They live close to local residents and gradually become interated into the local life--they learn to cook local dishes, they learn to speak the Shanghai dialect and they celebrate traditional Chinese holidays together with native people. Their lifestyle is becoming more and more similar to that of local residents.\nIn the past, foreigners that came to Shanghai were mostly representatives sent to work in the city. Today, however, many foreigners that live in the city are students, business starters or ordinary people. Related information shows that there are more than 50,000 foreigners living and working in Shanghai."

      "When she returned home after a year in South America, Judith Martin, a North American writer, began to have a problem. People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive, but that was not right. Fairly soon she figured out what was happening.\nWhen most South Americans talk to each other face-to-face, they stand closer together than North Americans do. Martin had not readjusted to North American distances. Apparently, she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space -- the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction. Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space, but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person's culture.\nObservations about personal space began about twenty years ago. Anthropologist Edward T. Hall was a pioneer in the field. He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people. In his book The Hidden Dimension, Hall invented the word \"proxemics\" to describe people's use of space as a means of communication. As Hall's book title indicates, most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist.\nPersonal space depends on invisible boundaries. Those boundaries move with people as they interact. Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment. People do not like anyone to trespass   on their personal space. As Cooper explains, invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions.\nResearchers working with Hall's data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors. For example, subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space. Fisher, Bell, and Baum report that groups of Hispanic-Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo-Americans do within theirs. They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers.\nAge also affects how people use personal space. Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five. As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space. By the time they reach puberty  , they have completely adapted to their culture's standards for interpersonal distances.\nGender   also influences people's use of personal space. For example, North American males' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them. Females, on the other hand, feel most negative about approaches from the side. Also, females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do, although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females. The gender factor changes, however, in high-density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States. As Maines observes, when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings, they choose people of the same sex.\nAs international travel and commerce increase, intercultural contact is becoming commonplace. Soon, perhaps, cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress. Until then, people need to make a special effort to learn one another's expectations concerning personal space. Once people are sensitive to such matters, they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture."

      "Wilderness\n\"In wilderness  is the preservation of the world.\" This is a famous saying from a writer regarded as one of the fathers of environmentalism. The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection: whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved.\nAs John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out, there is a strong appeal in images of the wild, the untouched; more than anything else, they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly. The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong, and the danger exploitation  brings to such landscapes  is real. Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need--the rainforests, for example, store carbon in vast quantities. To Mr.Sauven, these \"ecosystem services\" far outweigh the gains from exploitation.\nLee Lane, a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute, takes the opposing view. He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services, such as water conservation. But that is not, he argues, a reason to avoid all human presence, or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation. There are ever more people on the Earth, and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives, rather than merely struggle for survival. While the ways of using resources have improved, there is still a growing need for raw materials, and some wildernesses contain them in abundance. If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide, the argument goes, there is no further reason not to do so. Being untouched is not, in itself, a characteristic worth valuing above all others.\nI look forwards to seeing these views taken further, and to their being challenged by the other participants. One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly. And there is a practical question as to whether wildernesses can be exploited without harm.\nThis is a topic that calls for not only free expression of feelings, but also the guidance of reason. What position wilderness should enjoy in the preservation of the world obviously deserves much more serious thinking."

      "In 2010, 700 million people huddled together in front of their television sets to watch the World Cup final between the Netherlands and Spain. Even more are expected to tune in to this year's contest, which kicks off on June 12th with a match between Brazil and Croatia in Sao Paulo. Brazil are the runaway favourites to win the tournament, with bookmakers offering odds of less than three to one on the home team winning the championship.Many experts agree that the country will benefit from a strong home advantage, as local crowds roar on the Seleqao.How much does playing on home turf fealty affect a team's performance?\nSports scientists have come up with all sorts of theories to explain why playing at home helps. In 2007 a study investigated the influence of crowd noise on referees in the English football Premier League. It showed that _ were more likely to flash yellow cards and award penalties against touring players than the hosts, because they relied on the split-second rise in the home crowd's roar as a reminder to determine if a tackle deserved punishment. In the most recent season of the Spanish football Riga, two-thirds of all penalty kicks were awarded to the home team.\nIn the latest English football season, the top 20 clubs enjoyed a home success rate of 50%, while their victory rate on the road was 32%. In 12 of the past 19 World Cups the host nation has made it to the semi-finals and six times it has gone on to win. The effect can be seen in other sports too. _ Before the start of the London Olympics in 2012, UK Sport, a government agency, studied the results of more than 100 big tournaments across 14 Olympic sports. _ As it turned out, Britain bettered its 2008 performance by winning 18 more medals(10 of them gold), an improvement of 38% _ At the Beijing games, China won 59% more medals than it had done at the 2004 Athens games. _ Russia topped the medal table in Sochi:in the previous winter Olympics it had come sixth.\nGiven these numbers, it is not surprising that teams have poured money into maximizing their home advantage. For example, Brazil has spent a considerable fortune on, if somewhat leisurely, a programme of stadium construction and renovation. In all its home advantage is worth the equivalent of a 0.6-goal headstart in every match, according to Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Like most others, Goldman predicts that Brazil will triumph this year. Other countries' fans will have to hope for a miracle-and perhaps bid to stage the Cup on their own home turf next time."

      "In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievement and confident that their degree would help them find a good job.\nHowever, in the past four years the job market has changed dramatically. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets in years. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose University, got a degree in religious studies, but no job _ . He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs.\nFour years ago, the future looked bright for the class of 2003. There were many high-tech job opportunities. Graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as insurance and paid vacations. However, \"Times have changed and it's a new market,\" according to Cheryl Allmen- Vinnidge of the San Jose State Career Center.\nAllmen-Vinniage says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several internships , and they've majored in one of the few fields that are still hot, like chemical engineering, accounting, or nursing, where average starting salaries have actually increased over last year. Other popular fields (like information system management, computer science, and political science) have seen big declines in starting salaries.\nRyan Stewart (he had hoped to become a teacher) may just end up going back to school. \"I'd like to teach college some day and that requires more schooling, which would be great in bad economy.\" he said.\nIn conclusion, _ . For now, they can only hope its value will increase over time."

      "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful bird, which was very curious about hell. When she was little, her mother always told her that if she didn't _ the flying skills, she would go to hell. She was so curious about hell that she always asked others what hell looked like, but no one was sure, because none of them had ever been there. Some said hell was a place full of water, and others told her that hell was full of burning fire. However, the bird knew they were lying. She wanted to find out what hell was.\nWhen other birds were learning flying skills, she always hid herself and watched them. She thought in this way she could go to hell and see what hell looked like. However, she spent so little time learning flying skills that one day she was caught by a little boy. The little boy gave her to his grandpa in the countryside as a gift. The old man liked her very much. He made a delicate cage and put her in it. The bird was very worried because she thought she couldn't find out what hell was like staying in this small cage. However, she couldn't escape. Day after day, she just stayed in the cage, watching other birds flying. She lost her freedom and she became sadder and sadder. At last, she became ill. The old man finally opened the cage, but she was too weak to fly.

      "Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group plans to take its Hong Kong-listed unit private, two sources familiar with the matter said, and it working with Yahoo on an asset-exchange  deal that may result in Yahoo owning a direct stake  in one of Alibaba Group's operating businesses,.The sources revealed that taking Alibaba.com private was only one of the proposals being discussed and a final solution is still being worked out.\nAlibaba Group's plans are part of an overall deal being discussed by the board of Yahoo, which has come under fire from investors impatient with its lackluster performance. The shareholders are also frustrated with the apparent hesitation of stakeholders over how to handle its investments in Alibaba and other prized Asian assets.\nThe deal under discussion is that Alibaba Group would use borrowed money and internal cash as well as an asset exchange to buy back most of a 40 percent stake that Yahoo owns in Alibaba Group, the sources said,'Alibaba.com's share price has been quite bumpy since its listing. Probably taking it private will make it more flexible for the group to do the transformation that it is going through,' said Wendy Huang, head of regional Internet in Hong Kong. Trading in Alibaba.com shares was stopped on Thursday by an announcement from its parent.\nAlibaba Group currently owns about 73 percent in Alibaba.com, which has a market value of nearly $6 billion. At the current market price, the remaining is valued at about $1.6billion. Yahoo's stake in Alibaba Group has an estimated value of $14billion. Under the plans being discussed, Alibaba Group wants to buy back about 25 percent of its stake. Alibaba Group plans to pay a third of the money through a stake in one of its operating assets and the rest, or around $6 billion, in cash.Alibaba.com is the most likely operating unit in which yahoo may be offered a stake, one of the sources said. Both parties have an understanding on this arrangement, but have not signed any formal deal yet, the source added.\nAlibaba Group, founded by former English teacher and now billionaire Jack Ma, is looking to raise a loan of about $3 billion, which will be partly used to fund the buyback and the privatization.   \nSources previously admitted under a \"cash rich split\" plan being discussed, Yahoo would effectively transfer most of its 40 percent slice of Alibaba back to the Chinese company and all of its stake in Yahoo Japan to Softbank Corp. In return for cash and assets."

      "High school graduation is indeed important for the person concerned. It is usually marked by a party where friends and family present the person with gifts as a celebration. Below are some good choices for those who will go to college.\nYou can buy a folding bike. It is a good choice for a high school graduate going to college who may not have room to store a traditional bike. He or she will love moving around the school. It can be easily folded and carried, which would be great for those who often trip back home on weekends. You can also buy a Walkman. It is not expensive. The person can enjoy music while walking, exercising or studying. It can help improve one's mood.\nCollege is an important time for a person's career. Many high school graduates know little about the fields they will enter. So why not buy the person a book on what to expect in college life? That way the person would be fully prepared for college. Also he or she can tell something about it to his or her classmates. It is a reality that knowledge is something that cannot be taken away. Healthy food is a major issue in college. Some students have to put up with the bad-taste food in the college dining hall. A refrigerator which can keep food fresh is an excellent choice.\nIn short, there are so many you can choose from as high school graduation gifts.

      "I carry a Rubik's Cube   in my backpack. Solving it quickly is a terrific conversation starter. I usually ask people to try it first. They just turn the cube over in their hands, not even knowing where to begin. That's exactly what it was like for me to learn how to read. Letters and words were out of order. Nothing made sense because I am dyslexic.\nThe Rubik's Cube has made me believe that sometimes you have to take a few steps back in order to move forward. This was a reflection of my own life when I had to leave public school after the fourth grade. It's embarrassing to admit, but I still couldn't always spell my full name correctly. As a fifth-grader at a new school specializing in what's called \"language-processing disorder\", I had to start over. I then spent the next four years learning how to learn and find strategies that allowed me to return to my district's high school with the ability to communicate my ideas and express my intelligence.          \nNow, I can easily solve the 5x5x5. I discover that just before it is solved, a problem can look like a mess, and then suddenly you can find the solution. Early in my Rubik's career, I became so frustrated that I took the cube apart and rebuilt it. I believe that sometimes you have to look deeper and find answers in unexpected places. The Rubik's cube taught me that to accomplish something big, it helps to break it down into small pieces. I learned that it's important to spend a lot of time thinking, to try to find connections and patterns. I believe that there are surprises around the corner.\nLike life itself, the Rubik's cube can be frustrating puzzle. So everyday I carry a Rubik's cube in my backpack as a reminder that I can achieve my goals, no matter what obstacles I face."

      "As a young ice skater, I had flown pretty high, pretty quickly. My partner and I won the Canadian junior pairs championship when I was 14. Later I was thrilled to be picked to skate in the 1994 Olympics in lillehammer, Norway. But then everything came down. \n   We finished the 12th at the Games. I soon quit double skating and tried to continue in singles. But I wasn't good enough; I didn't even compete in the next two national championships. I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody. \n   I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, \"You can't just depend on skating to make a living. You'd better find a job.\" I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked. \n   That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, \"This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! \" It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that \"the customer is always right\" and a smile can go a long way. \"I'm really sorry, sir. I'll get you a free cup.\" I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip! \n   My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss's praise. They meant so much to me."

      "Another man-made wonder of the US was built long before the nation was established. About 900 years ago, the Ancestral Puebloan people built villages high in the walls of canyons in Colorado, where 600 cliff dwellings are now part of the Mesa Verde National Park.\nVisitors can stand at the top and look into the dwellings almost hidden in openings of the rock walls.The Puebloan people cut small steps into the rock, which connected buildings containing hundreds of rooms.\nThe rock walls have protected the buildings from severe weather in the area; therefore, they remain mostly unchanged in the hundreds of years since they were built.\nOur final man-made wonder is in the northwestern city of Seattle, Washington. The Space Needle was built as the central structure for the 1962 World's Fair.\nThe 184-meter-tall structure was designed by Edward Carlson, which has a wide base on the ground, with its middle narrow and a large ring-like structure on top.The structure was meant to look like a \"flying saucer,\" a vehicle that was popular in science fiction space travel stories. The saucer includes an observation area and eating place.The restaurant slowly turns to provide visitors with a 360 degree view of Seattle.\nThe Space Needle was not very costly, and was designed and completed in about a year and opened on the first day of the World's Fair.\nToday, the Space Needle is the most popular place for visitors to Seattle.

      "Beer and fried chicken -- Thanks to a South Korean drama currently on air, Man From the Stars, this new mix-and-match junk food trend has become popular among young audiences, despite its unhealthy nature. Indeed, South Korean TV dramas, or K-drama for short, have been a major force in the South Korean pop-culture wave that has captured the hearts of young Chinese audiences. According to iQiyi, a video website that features Man From the Stars, by Feb 15, the number of views for the TV drama hit 370 million in China.\n\"It is interesting to explore what elements of those dramas appeal to audiences. It's obviously more than just pretty faces,\" says Yan Feng, a professor of Chinese literature at Fudan University. Reflected by audiences, culture critics and insiders of the industry, youth fantasy, creative storylines, cultural _ , and well-organized production all add up to K-drama's success, along with, of course, those handsome and cute faces dressed in the latest fashion trends.\n\"Everyone fancies a perfect partner, handsome or beautiful,\" says Zhou Ying, a professor at Chongqing Technology and Business University. \"The South Korean TV industry is feeding this need.\" After Lee Min-ho appeared on CCTV's annual Spring Festival gala, he became the most famous South Korean in China. Only weeks later, Kim Soo-hyun, lead actor in Man From the Stars, swept the country. Apart from pretty faces, fashion is another highlight of the series. Each time actors from the series wear a new set of outfits, similar clothes experience a sales boom online, according to Xiao Yi, a Taobao store owner.\nAs is known, with love triangles, incurable diseases, and Cinderella tales, storylines in South Korean dramas may seem a bit commonplace. While The Man From the Stars challenges this by putting aliens and time travel into these existing stories, Peng Sanyuan, a screenwriter, says a focus on detail is a key factor in the success of these dramas. \"In order to accurately target audiences and find emotional reflections with them, more and more female writers are working in the industry,\" says Peng about her experience of exchanging ideas with South Korean colleagues. According the experts, South Korean writers somehow make sense of these plots, no matter how unlikely it seems."

      "For many people, leisure time is an opportunity to get outdoors, have some fun and meet interesting people. Add two pieces of advanced 21stcentury technology -- global positioning system (GPS) devices and the Internet -- to get \"geocaching\".\nThe word geocaching comes from \"geo\" (earth) and \"cache\" (hidden storage). Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public. Using an inexpensive GPS device, anyone on earth can send a signal to the satellites and receive information about their position. This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area. As for the content of the caches, owners and finders must only use items that are suitable for the whole family, as caches are found by geocachers of all ages."

      "I hated dinner parties. But I decided to give them another _ because I'm in London. And my friend Mallery invited me. And because dinner parties in London are very different from those back in New York. There, \"I'm having a dinner party\" means \"I'm booking a table for 12 at a restaurant you can't afford and we'll be sharing the cheque evenly, no matter what you eat.\"\nWorse, in Manhattan there is always someone who leaves before the bill arrives. They'll throw down cash, half of what they owe, and then people like me, who don't drink, end up paying even more. But if I try to use the same trick, the hostess will shout \"Where are you going?\" And it's not like I can say I have somewhere to go : everyone knows I have nowhere to go.\nBut in London, dinner parties are in people's homes. Not only that, the guests are an interesting mix. The last time I went to one, the guests were from France, India, Denmark and Nigeria; it was like a gathering at the United Nations. In New York, the mix is less striking. It's like a gathering at Bloomingdale's, a well-known department store.\nFor New Yorkers, talking about other parts of the world means Brooklyn and Queens in New York. But at Mallery's, when I said that I had been to Myanmar recently, people knew where it was. In New York people would think it was a usual new club."

      "Many of us already know about several American superstitions . Having a black cat cross your path, walking under a ladder, and breaking a mirror are all bad luck. In addition to these, there are many other superstitions that are worth knowing. Understanding them will keep you safe from evil spirits--if you believe in such things--and impress your American friends when you mention them.\nLike the superstitions in other cultures, American superstitions often involve the things important in daily life, such as health, numbers, and marriage. For example, have you ever had a cough that would not go away? According to one American superstition, you should take a piece of your hair and put it between two slices of buttered bread. Next, feed this hair sandwich to a dog and say, \"Eat well, you hound, may you be sick and I be sound.\"This will trick the evil spirits and help your cough. _ .\nIn American superstitions, the number three is very important. Often, Americans will say, \"All things come in threes.\" Three is lucky because it represents the traditional family: mother, father, and child. Therefore, gifts, letters, and guests will often arrive at your home in groups of three. However, it is also possible for bad events, like accidents and funerals, to come in threes as well.\nAnother time people pay attention to superstitions is when they get married. During a wedding, brides must wear or carry\"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"The old and borrowed things will bring luck to the person who gives them to the bride. The new and blue things will bring good fortune to the bride herself. The next time someone you know is getting married, be sure to recite this phrase.\nAs it would be unlucky to discuss one more superstition, we will wind things up here. Keep your fingers crossed, and stay lucky!"

But he could not go far beneath its surface.\nMan wants to explore deep into the sea. However, he is not a fish. He must breathe air, so he can't stay under the water's surface for any length of time. To explore deep water, man faces even more dangers and problems.\nA diver who wants to stay under water for more than a few minutes must breathe air or a special mixture of gases.

Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea. His body is under great pressure.\nWhen a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles. The diver is then suffering from the bends.

Sal Tinajero, Rojas'speech and debate coach at Fullerton, told the newspaper that Rojas is a hardworking self-starter who thrives   on competition. _ Tinajero said.\nAfter visiting several campuses, he settled on Yale, which costs $64, 000 a year with room and board.

      "If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble.\nSome doctors now think that the internal  fat surrounding important organs like the heart or liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily.\n\"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not fat,\" said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create \"fat maps\" showing where people store fat.\nAccording to the result, people who keep their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are slim.\nEven people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent.\nAccording to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat. They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat. Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere.\nDoctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some think it has something to do with heart disease and diabetes. They want to prove that internal fat damages the body's communication systems.\nThe good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. \"If you want to be healthy, there is no _ . Exercise has to be an important part of your lifestyle,\" Bell said."

      "Tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world. It is responsible for the death of one in ten adults worldwide (about 5 million deaths each year). If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 10 million deaths each year by 2020. Half the people that smoke today, which is about 650 million people, will eventually be killed by tobacco.\nTobacco is the fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide. The economic costs of tobacco use are equally devastating  . In addition to the high public health costs of treating tobacco-caused diseases, tobacco kills people at the height of their productivity, depriving   families of breadwinners and nations of a healthy workforce. Tobacco users are also less productive while they are alive due to increased sickness. A 1994 report estimated that the use of tobacco resulted in an annual global net loss of 200 thousand million US dollars, a third of this loss being in developing countries.\nTobacco and poverty are closely linked. Many studies have shown that in the poorest households in some low-income countries as much as 10% of total household expenditure is on tobacco. This means that these families have less money to spend on basic items such as food, education and health care. It contributes to a higher _ rate, since money that could have been used for education is spent on tobacco instead."

      "New Zealand\nWhat can you see?   Mountains, volcanoes, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, forests, beaches. Both islands are mountainous. In fact, only 30% of New Zealand is flat.\nThe Maoris\nWhen the Maoris first arrived in New Zealand, they lived in villages and were excellent fishermen, hunters and farmers. About 50 years ago many Maoris started to live and work in the large cities and took jobs in government, industries, medicine and education. They are proud of their culture and are determined to keep many of the customs which are part of their way of life.\nWho can you meet?  Most people live on North Island. Eighty-five percent of New Zealanders are \"pakeha\" (\"white men\"), which means their \"great grandfathers\" came from Europe. Ten percent are Maoris.

      "\"The 13th of June, 1325, Ileft Tangier, my birthplace, with the intention of making the pilgrimage to Mecca...to leave all my friends, to abandon my home as birds abandon their nests.\"So begins an old manuscript in a library in Paris-the travel diary of the Ibn Battuta.\nAlmost two centuries before Columbus, this young Moroccan set off forMecca, returning home three decades later as one of history's great travelers. Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote comers of the Islamic world, traveling through 44 modern countries, three times as far as Marco Polo. Little celebrated in the West,his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him.\nIbn Battuta stayed in Mecca as a student for several years, but the urge to travel soon took over. In one adventure, he traveled to India seeking profitable employment with the sultan--the Muslim ruler of Delhi. On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 men on foot, and two horsemen:\"...I was hit by an arrow and my horse by another, but God in his grace preserved me...\"In Delhi, thesultan gave him the position of judge, based on his previous study at Mecca. But the sultan had an unpredictable character, and Ibn Battutalooked for an opportunity to leave. When the sultan offered to finance a trip to China, he agreed. Ibn Battuta set off in three ships, but misfortune struck while he was still on the shore. Asudden storm grounded and broke up two ships, scattering treasure and drowning many people and horses. As he watched, thethird ships, with all his belongings and slaves-one carrying his child-was carried out to sea and never heard from again.\nAfter a lifetime of amazing adventures, Ibn Battuta was finally ordered by the Sultan of Morocco to return home to share his wisdom with the world. Fortunately, he agreed and wrote a book that has been translated into numerous languages, allowing people everywhereto read about his unparalleled journeys."

      "I ALMOST failed out of college and it nearly broke my self-confidence. I had been at the top of my high school class, the total golden child. So when I decided that I wanted to attend Columbia University for graduate school, I was sure it would be close to impossible.\nMy goals were to prove to myself that my years of academic success in secondary school had not happened by chance and prepare for a career in children's media. But first I had to get in.\nSo I enrolled   in a GRE test prep course and threw myself into the class. The first part was pretty scary and by the third, I knew it wasn't going to get any easier. I reconsidered my plan to take the GRE.\nFor the first time in my life, I considered how I should go about getting into graduate school. What were my special skills? Would any of them get me into graduate school?\nI got a job working on a project sponsored by the dean's   office on campus and enrolled in a class. I had a new plan: Be a top student in the class while working on campus, get letters of recommendation from my boss and my professor, then hope that _ like writing interesting papers would be enough for my application.\nI worked my butt off   that semester. With finals approaching, I felt confident I would get an \"A\" in the course, so it was time for step two. I asked my boss to write a letter of recommendation. She immediately agreed. But my professor said no. She did not know me well enough and the semester was not completed. However, I decided I just would not take no for an answer. I asked if she would least write a short note unofficially supporting my application. After some uncomfortable conversations, she finally agreed. In the end, I got in!\nI revisit that moment of persistence   again and again. I have leapt into many other opportunities since then. Now I am starting a company born out of my graduate school research in children's media. Our first product is a mobile game for teen girls that breaks down major life milestones   into missions  . On its surface, the product helps girls connect with each other. But it also helps them develop the tools to live life without limits."

      "English is the most widely used language in the history of our planet. One in every seven human beings can speak it. More than half of the world's books and three quarters of international mail are in English. Of all languages, English has the largest vocabulary-perhaps as many as two million words.\nHowever, let's face it: English is a crazy language. There is no egg in an eggplant, neither pine nor apple in a pineapple and no ham in a hamburger. Sweet-meats are candy, while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.\nWe take English for granted. But when we explore its paradoxes  , we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square,  public bathrooms have no baths in them.\nAnd why is it that a writer writes, but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce, and hammers don't ham?

      "During the 19th century, women's education was not considered important in the United States. Supporters of advanced education for women faced many problems. States did require each town to provide a school for children, but teachers were often poorly prepared. Most young women were not able to continue on with their education in private schools. If they did, they often were not taught much except the French language, how to sew   clothing, and music.\nMary Lyon felt that women's education was extremely important. Through her lifelong work for education she became the most famous woman in the 19th century America. She believed that women were teachers both at home and in the classroom. And she believed that efforts to better educate young women also served God. If women were better educated, she felt, they could teach in local schools throughout the United States and in foreign countries.\nIn 1837, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Seminary for Women. Only four teachers and the first class of eighty young women lived and studied in the building when the school opened. But Mary knew the importance of what had been established   -- the first independent school for the higher education of women. The school continued to grow. In 1893, under a state law, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary became a college. Mount Holyoke College was the first college to offer women the same education as was offered to men.\nPeople who have studied Mary Lyon say she was not fighting a battle   of equality between men and women, yet she knew she wanted more for women. Her efforts led to the spread of higher education for women in the United States. Historians say she was the strongest influence on the education of American young people during the middle of the 19th century."

      "At 10:35 a.m. on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. \nOrville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.\nBefore the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. \nWhen they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   \nAfter Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history."

      "More women are graduating from colleges than men.The situation is causing some people to worry about the future.The trend could cause social problems,according to a report on July 8 by the Washington Post.\nWomen received about 57 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded this year from colleges and universities in the United States.The figure of 57 percent has been the highest since World War II ended in 1945.During the war,many men were in the military.\nThe gap between men and women is greater among African Americans and Hispanics.Two AfricanAmerican women receive a degree for every AfricanAmerican man.Only 40 percent of Hispanics who get a degree are males.\nThe USA Department of Education estimates 698,000 females received bachelor's degree this year.The number of male graduates was 529,000.The trend toward more female graduates began in the mid1980s.Nobody seems to know why.However,many theories exist.\nResearchers say the trend could lead to social problems.They also say this may indicate two things.It may reflect the increasing success of women.But it also may show the educational problems affecting men.\nHigh school graduation rates are slightly lower for men than for women.Males also make up the vast majority of students in special education classes.\nThe Business Roundtable is studying the trend.The group is an organization of chief executives of some of the nation's largest corporations.Susan Traiman is the director of the group's education policy.Traiman said the nation couldn't afford to let half its population fail to develop skills needed for the future."

      "According to the American Automobile Association , since 1964 all cars sold in the United States have been equipped with seat belts (These are also called safety belts.) . Many studies of automobile accidents have shown that safety belts can save lives. One study showed that forty percent of those killed in auto accidents could have been saved if they had been wearing seat belts.\nUnfortunately, belts are worn only by a small percentage of drivers and passengers -- about fifteen percent in cities, and only nine percent in small towns. And safety belts cannot protect people who do not wear them.\nIn order to find out what kinds of people do wear seat belts, a study was made in several cities of the United States. The following facts were about those who use their safety belts:\n1. They do not smoke while driving.\n2. They have had more education than non-users.\n3. They know someone who was injured (but not killed) in an automobile accident.\nAdvertisements based on these facts have been printed in newspapers and magazines in order to teach people the importance of using seat belts. But these advertisements have not helped much. Some people believe there should be a law requiring drivers and passengers to use safety belts. In Australia, where there is such a law, deaths in auto accidents have decreased twenty-four percent."

      "The very first capsule hotel to be opened in Shanghai has attracted many budget travelers with its prices, even though it is not fully operational yet.\nThe hotel consists of 68 \"capsules\", each 1.1-meters high, 1.1-meters wide and 2.2-meters long. The basic rate is 28 Yuan ($4.22) per person, plus an additional 4 Yuan an hour. The hotel also offers a package of 68 Yuan for 10 hours and 88 Yuan for 24 hours.\nAll of the capsules are imported from Japan where capsule hotels originated,and each is equipped with independent sockets, clocks, lights, TV and wireless Internet service. The hotel also has a public lavatory ,shower room, smoking room and shared guest room.\n\"This is a huge bargain compared with other budget hotels in Shanghai,\" said Ta Zan, the owner of the hotel. Ta used to stay at capsule hotels in Tokyo during his undergraduate years and worked at a capsule hotel while he was doing his MBA in Japan in 2005, so he knows how they work and how to make guests feel comfortable.\nHe based the hotel on capsule hotels in Japan but he has made some special changes based on Chinese guests' habits. \"In Japan capsule hotels are usually equipped with bathtubs, but in China people are more willing to take a shower, so we have the shower room,\" he said. He has also separated the capsules into three snoring   zones so that guests who often snore won't disturb others. Like most of capsule hotels in Japan, the one in Shanghai is for men only.\nBut the idea of staying in such a _ space is not appealing to everyone. \"I feel the idea is like putting a person in a coffin  , and the price is also not that appealing. A bed at a youth hostel in Shanghai costs about 60 Yuan per night,\" said Wang Lei, a student from Beijing."

      "A three-mile-long fishhook-shaped piece of land in the middle of Chesapeake Bay, Tangier Island has always been a community set apart from the mainland.\nThese days, the island's 500-plus residents, who mostly use golf cars as transportation on the village's narrow roads and who don't allow the public consumption of alcohol, have managed to preserve their traditional culture.\nProbably the most striking example of their heritage is the islanders' unique way of speaking.\nDavid L.Shores, a linguist   who was born on Tangier Island,  has found out the reason why the speech of Tangier Island strikes outsiders as strange.\nAccording to Shores, the islanders pronounce their vowels louder and longer, which causes common words to sound different when spoken by Tangier natives.\nSome, scholars have said the natives of Tangier speak an old form of English that goes back to the time of Queen F.Elizabeth I.Shores doesn't buy into that theory. \"It's not Eliza- bethan English by any means,\" he says.\" I doubt if anyone could trace it to that, because the variety of English at that time were great.\" \nBruce Gordy, a Tangier native and a former teacher at the island's only school, has made a list of 350 strange expressions and words that he says are used and undertook only by the islanders.But Gordy clones' think it's the strange vocabulary that puzzles outsiders most when hearing Tangier residents speak.\n\"I think what confuses t.hem is the fact that we are ' talking backwards a lot.,\"  he say's.\nHe offers an example.\"If somebody's stupid, you know what I say?\" Gordy says.\" I'm saying he's smart, but the way I say it makes everyone know I'm emphasizing he's stupid\nBoth Gordy and Shores believe Tangier's isolation  has led to the islanders' unusual way of speaking.\nNow, the economy of Tangier Island is moving away from its tradition of crabbing and fishing as the number of crabs and oysters in the bay declines.More residents are finding work on tugboats or looking for jobs on the mainland.\n\" Of course the sons and daughters went with their dad out crabbing.

      "Kids who receive special education are, without doubt, the hardest working children in any school. When they are having difficulty learning basic literacy and number concepts, when they break rules, when they need more services, support and adult attention than their peers, then they are struggling the hardest. In psychology, we are trained to think that if we are feeling angry or confused when sitting with a patient, then we are probably feeling just what our patient is feeling. The same is true for students with disabilities. Whatever we feel when we work with them, they are probably feeling as they work with us.\n    If you have a disability that affects your education, then you have a brain disorder. Because education, even in mathematics, is largely verbal , most brain disorders responsible for educational disabilities affect language, and how you process words and ideas in written and oral form. To imagine how much effort a child with a language disability spends each school day, imagine yourself attending a school today taught in a language you had a basic understanding of. Imagine though, that while you seem fluent to others, you have trouble when people talk too fast, use idioms or expressions.\n   When adults and classmates blame, or criticize kids who receive special education, they are struggling with their own confusion. It is difficult to imagine the world as it is lived by someone with an educational disability. It is difficult to understand how someone who can be so \"normal\" can have so many problems. It is so easy to imagine that if they just tried harder... without understanding that just to do the ordinary, kids with disabilities are making an extraordinary effort."

      "Culture and Cuisine\nThe United States is known for jazz and blue jeans.But travel to Paris and ask your average French citizen about American cuisine   and he's likely to answer,\" McDonalds.\" Ask the same thing of any American citizen on any American street and I'm afraid you'd get the same answer,or something close to it.\nHamburgers and hotdogs and fries are all fine,but with American malls and other outlets standardizing everything from clothing to food,the sad truth is that American cuisine is becoming more homogeneous--all the same--no matter where you live.True,many Americans are eating more varied foods these days,but these are largely the cuisines of immigrant groups,and they are quite likely to be affected by homogenization of American cuisine.\nSo what exactly is American cuisine? Well,to some extent it is a reflection of our melting pot culture,meaning that Europeans made huge contributions in the form of wheat,dairy products,pork,beef and poultry.But American cuisine also includes products that once were known only to the New World,including potatoes,corn,pumpkin,sweet potatoes,and peanuts.\nThe one region of the country where you still find all these things in daily use is the Deep South.The South lost the Civil War,but children of the southerners are winning the battle to preserve and advance their cooking traditions--and in this case one of the few cuisines can truly be called American,which is why we're pleased to have Low Country cuisine in this issue of food creation.That's right,grits and gravy are back in a big way in cities like Charleston and Savannah.Truth is,they never really left,but up until a decade ago Low Country cuisine was more common at home than in restaurants.\nIn fact,a large number of tourists now go to the lower Atlantic region in order to experience this extraordinary cuisine for themselves.Time will tell whether Low Country cuisine becomes popular in other regions of the country in the way that,say,Italian cuisine has,but it's amazing and heartening to see one of our true cultural treasures enjoying renewed popularity in these increasingly homogeneous times."

      "It is never too early for young children to compete in athletic activities. It is true that children used to take part in outdoor sports and games. Today many young people stay inside watching television, playing computer games, or surfing the Internet. Rarely can people see children today, enjoying themselves outdoors, on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods.\n   Young people who join in after-school sports activities will be out of the house. They will be on the move, running and jumping, which is great exercise. They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player, whey they are part of an organized sport. They also learn about good sportsmanship, teamwork and gaining confidence. There are even sports that young athletes do better in school. Outdoor sports give children, teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine, which improve their over-all health. They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun, and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity  . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing.\n   Children do better in sports events, when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity. While track and field events may not be some small children's cup of tea, there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards. The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time. The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each, for a total of 6. Eight-year-old Jerel Rhodes II, won gold medals for the shot put  , and the discus   throw. Seven-year-old Jadyn Rhodes, received a silver medal fro the shot put, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter race. Five-year-old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800-meter race, as well as the discuss throw.\n   There is a down side to athletic activities. Not everyone will go home as a winner. If your child does not win a medal, you should not complain about him or her. You should be proud of him or her just for taking part. If a child feels bad about his or her performance, he or she may be teased by other children, or his or her parents may express disappointment. All these can have an effect on self-esteem. The bottom line is to get your children out of the house, and to be involved in activities that keep them moving. Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all. If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making, encourage --but do not push -- him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports.\nThe Mayo Clinic, an internationally famous medical research group, says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports. Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable, or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them. If you encourage those like the Rhodes family, who have the desire to play sports, they just might bring home a gold, silver or bronze medal."

      "America used to have a strong college education system for prison inmates (prisoners). It was seen as a way to _ men and women in prison by helping them go straight when they got out.\nThose taxpayer-supported college classes were put to an end in the 1990s. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would like to bring them back in the state, setting off a fierce new debate.\nA number of lawmakers in New York have promised to kill Cuomo's proposal  .\nCuomo says reintroducing taxpayer-funded college classes in New York's prisons is a common-sense plan that will reduce the number of inmates who commit new crimes.\n\"You pay $ 60,000 for a prison cell for a year,\" Cuomo responded. \"You put a guy away for 10 years, and that's $600,000. Right now, chances are almost half. Once he's set free, he's going to come right back.\"\nCuomo says helping inmates get a college education would cost about $ 5,000 a year per person. He argues, \"It's a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison.\"\nBut even some members of the governor's own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won't stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids' college fees.\n\"That is the vast majority of feedback   that I'm also getting from my constituents  ,\" she says. \"You know, 'Where is the relief for the rest of the population who obey the law ?' \"\n\"I was very disappointed that the policy had been changed,\" says Gerald Gaes, who served as an expert on college programs for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the 1990s. In 1994, President Clinton stopped federal student aid programs for inmates.\nGaes says research shows that college classes actually save taxpayers' money over time, by reducing the number of inmates who break the law and wind up back in those expensive prison cells.\n\"It is cost-effective,\" he says. \"Designing prisons that way will have a long-term benefit for New York State.\""

      "Next Thursday, November 27th(the fourth Thursday in November), Americans will gather with family and friends to share a big meal to celebrate Thanksgiving. They might play games, tell stories or watch football on television together.\nAngelo Rosa has more Thanksgiving memories than most people. From Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, the 100-year-old man lives in the same house where he celebrated a great number of Thanksgiving.\nBut he says it was different when he was a child. Mr. Rosa was just three when his family came to America. \"When we were small children, Thanksgiving was never a very big holiday because at the time we actually didn't pay too much attention to it.\" But, also, he says, his parents faced a language difficulty. \"They were from Italy and spoke very broken English, because they were the first generation that came over here.\"\nAnd the family had little money. There were six children. Mr. Rosa's father was a coal miner in Pennsylvania. The family was not able to have big, costly dinners, especially during the hard time of the 1930's. But Mr. Rosa says Thanksgiving dinners became a tradition in his own family after he married and had children.\nThis Thanksgiving, Angelo Rosa will go to the home of his daughter about twenty minutes away. He will celebrate the day with loved ones, including his great-grandchildren.\nOn the other side of the country, Cathie Dahlstrom is preparing dishes for a group of 35 to 40 people in Concord, California. We asked Ms Dahlstrom what she is thankful for this year; her first answer is \"The election.\" She said she is also deeply grateful for her very large family. Ms Dahlstrom has one daughter. She has five younger brothers and sisters. She also has eight stepbrothers and stepsisters. Many of them and their families will be at the Thanksgiving dinner."

      "Even as Americans have been gaining weight, they have cut their average fat intake from 36 to 34 percent of their total diets in the past 15 years.  And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.\nBut cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. \nNonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group's yogurt label said \"high fat\"--the other, \"low fat.\" The \"low fat\" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. \"People think they've saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences,\" says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. \"But when they do that, they don't compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it.\""

      "Books are a high cost of higher education. But the Global Text Project hopes to create a free library of one thousand electronic textbooks for students in developing countries.\n  The aim is to offer subjects that students may take in their first few years at university. The books could be printed or read on a computer or copied onto a CD or DVD.\n  Richard Watson is the acting head of the department of management information systems at the University of Georgia,who says the idea goes back several years. He was teaching a computer programming class but did not have a good textbook. So he asked his students each to write part of the book that he would organize and edit. By the end of the term, Professor Watson had a finished product. Since then he has used it for other classes. Now, Professor Watson is seeking volunteers to supervise  the creation of books for the library. He is looking for professors or other professionals.\n  The Global Text Project is similar in technology to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (a reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects) that anyone can edit on the Internet. But only one or two people will be able to make the final edits in texts. \n  The project includes a committee  of scholars, mostly from developing countries, to advise on required textbooks and their contents.\n  The group's first book on information systems is being tested in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The plan is to offer about ten free books within the next year, including an English grammar text. Project organizers also want to offer textbooks in Arabic, Chinese and Spanish. They are working with a translation company and students could also get involved. For example, a student learning English in an Arab country could translate part of a book into Arabic. Then another student and the class professor could check the translation."

      "Kodak's decision to file for bankruptcy   protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution.\nAlthough many attribute Kodak's downfall to \"complacency   ,\" that explanation doesn't acknowledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak predicted that digital photography would overtake film   -- and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.\n\"It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future\", said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late.\nKodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets   into the new businesses.\nAlthough Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography, its corporate   culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.\nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace."

I was dreaming that when I will be an adult.

Then I thought the perfect car would be a solar car. \"\nHis car, which has become a major attraction at the gates of the summit of some 188 nations, was built in three years with scientific help from four universities and 15 Swiss companies. The car pulls a trailer with six square meters of solar panels which absorb the sun. The electricity is fed into the battery which powers the car, and can run for up to 100 kilometers a day.\n\"It's the first time in history that a car is driving around the world without a single drop of petrol, \" said Palmer.\nHis epic solar journey is not his first adventure--he crossed Africa on a bicycle and North America in a light aircraft.\nSo far, Palmer has gone by land through Europe and the Middle East, then by sea to India and on to Indonesia. After covering much of Asia, Australia, North America and Africa, he will return to Switzerland to try and drum up support for the commercial possibilities of solar cars.\nFor the moment, he _ , with more curious customers waiting to take a ride in his unique automobile which, he said, \"works like a Swiss clock. \""

      "Pushing children too hard is a really big social problem that seems to be getting worse. Now we have 6montholds in music classes and swimming classes. Parents fear that if other children are attending these classes,they will be holding their own children back if they do not enroll,too.\nThe other extreme,simply taking a laissez-faire approach and letting children do--or refuse to do--whatever they want,is not the answer either,of course.\nDr Taylor emphasizes that parents need to push their children based on what is best for the children,not what is best for themselves. If children understand that an activity is in their best interests,then they will accept it,he finds.\nDr Taylor and other family experts remain pessimistic  about the possibilities for widespread social change. \"The force of our popular culture,driven by money and superficial   values,cannot be resisted,\" he says. But change can take place at a \"microlevel\",in families and schools.\nWhen changes do occur,the rewards can benefit everyone in the family. One mother supporting this new approach toward parenting mentions the advantages her family experienced after her children cut back on activities. \"The biggest thing is that since we have done this,we are rested,\" she says. \"Not only are our kids rested,because they're not in a ton of stuff,but my husband and I are rested,because we're not driving them everywhere.

The order by which the athletes enter the competition is not general,but it is set depending on the event. Usually the athlete with the lowest weight begins. If he/she is not successful,he/she can try later. There is a maximum of three lifts allowed for every competition.\nFor many years Olympic weightlifting was only for men. However,now women also take part in Olympic weightlifting. It was at the beginning of the 21st century that women's competitions entered an organized professional environment. For women,Olympic weightlifting is more difficult because of their different body structure. However,strength training techniques   are widely and successfully used by women,too.\nLots of the athletes who've ended up in Olympic weightlifting competitions have started with strength training only to improve their muscle condition and their body power.

A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time.\nHis grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC.\n\"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,\" Dickinson told KABC.\nThat's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal.\n\"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'\"Dickinson told KABC.\nAuthorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana  at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel.\nThanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy.\n\"You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating  circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,\" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. \"I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers.\""

      "Normally a student must attend a certain number of courses in order to graduate, and each course which he attends gives him a credit which he may count towards a degree. In many American universities the total work for a degree consists of thirty-six courses, each lasting for one semester. A typical course consists of three classes per week for fifteen weeks; while attending a university a student will probably attend four or five courses during each semester. Normally a student would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though this is not in fact done as a regular practice.\nFor every course that he follows a student is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is available for the student to show to future employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and stress of work, but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs. Elections to positions in student organizations arouse much enthusiasm. The effective work of maintaining discipline is usually performed by students who advise the academic authorities. Any student who is thought to have broken the rules, for example, by cheating has to appear before a student court. With the enormous numbers of students, the operation of the system does involve a certain amount of activity. A student who has held one of these positions of authority is much respected and will be of benefit to him later in his career."

      "Are you willing to work for a robot boss? Sorry if your answer is \"no\", because it will be common in the near future, according to the researchers from the Oxford.\nA third of British jobs are at \"high risk\" of being replaced by robots in the next 20 years, the research by Deloitte, the Oxford Martin School and the University of Oxford found.\nWired magazine went further. \"It may be hard to believe, but before the end of this century, 70 percent of today's jobs will be replaced by automation ,\" said the magazine in 2012.\nOf course, people being replaced by robots is not recent news. Robots have been taking over labor work in factories and on farms for some time, lifting heavy boxes and picking fruit and vegetables. Next, cleaning jobs in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots, starting with easy-to-do floors and windows and eventually moving to toilets, Wired predicted.\nBut that's just the beginning. Even white-collar jobs are not safe. Any jobs dealing with sales and services or lots of paperwork could be taken over by robots in the future. For example, in the UK, library assistants have decreased by 48 percent since 2001, sales-related jobs have fallen by 40 percent, and travel agents by 44 percent, the Daily Mail reported.\nBut that doesn't mean that human beings will have nothing to do in the future. Instead, we need to update our skills. Digital know-how, management and creativity will be in greater need in the future, said British Consulting Company Deloitte."

      "NASA's Mars detector  , Opportunity, succeeded in finding signs that water once existed on the planet. Opportunity landed on Mars in January. Scientists now believe that the planet could once have supported life.\nThis discovery was chosen by Science, one of the world's leading magazines, as the most important scientific achievement of 2004 last Friday.\n\"This little, wheeled, one-armed box went around another planet and has done something no human has ever managed,\" according to Science. \"It has discovered another place in the universe where life could once have existed.\"\n\"Although we still can't say that life could have existed in this environment, it is now certain that there was water on Mars,\" said Steve Squyres, one of the scientists working on the Mars mission. The evidence comes from pictures and chemical readings taken by Opportunity. It includes marks on rocks like those caused by flowing water on Earth and salty chemicals like those found in dried-out sea-beds. Scientists said the new evidence proved beyond doubt that water has existed on Mars. But it is still unknown whether the water on Mars was like an ocean or just ice.\nWhile Opportunity has not found any signs of life, the presence of water means life is possible. \"In everything we know about life on Earth, there is no example without liquid water,\" Squyres said. \"So water is important for the search for life on Mars.\"\nResearchers agree that a future mission   should bring back physical samples  . But some scientists worry about the risk that this could introduce dangerous foreign creatures to Earth. \"The problem here is how to get the samples back,\" Squyres replied. \"I think it is our responsibility to limit any risk.\""

      "When you are admitted to a local university, especially one without accommodation, perhaps you'll live at home and become a commuting student which benefits you. It's cheaper and you can have a comfortable and familiar situation, which means you'll enjoy home meals you're used to instead of the changeless food in the university cafe.\nHowever, commuting students need to try their best to get involved in the life of their college and to take special steps to meet their fellow students. Often, this means you should be active to seek out and talk to people in your classes whom you think you might like.\nOne problem that commuting students sometimes face is their parents' unwillingness to recognize that they're adults. The change from high school to college is a big one, and if you live at home you need to develop the same kind of independence you'd have when you were living away. Home rules that might have been appropriate when you were in high school don't apply. If your parents are reluctant to renegotiate, you can speed the process along by letting your behavior show that you have the responsibility that goes with maturity. Parents are more willing to acknowledge their children as adults when they behave like adults. If, however, there's so much friction  at home that it disturbs your academic work, you might want to consider sharing an apartment with one or more friends. Sometimes this is a happy solution when family tensions make everyone miserable."

In particular, Tegan had found a little tea set and had begun pretending that she was having a tea party. She set up all the place settings and arranged her table with the great care and elegance that only a three-year-old can create. Meanwhile, her Daddy _ conversation, and as he continued to chat with his family, Tegan would hand him a cup of \"tea\". Her Daddy, who always tries to participate in her games, would pause for a few seconds from his conversation, and say all the proper words and gestures for her tea party which would thrill Tegan. He would request two lumps of sugar. He would tell her how wonderful her tea tasted, and then he would continue his adult conversation with his family.\nAfter going through this routine several times, her Daddy suddenly awoke to reality as he had a flash of concern in his mind: \"She is only three years old, where is she getting this 'tea' that I've been dutifully drinking?\" He quietly followed her, without her knowing, and his fears were growing stronger as he saw her turn and go through the bathroom door. Sure enough, there she was stretching up on her tippy toes reaching up to get her 'tea' water -- out of the container of water that grandpa used to soak his false teeth!"

      "A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was alarmed to discover that it was a rat trap  .\nGoing back to the farmyard the rat gave a warning: \"There is a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!\" The chicken raised her head and said: \"Excuse me, Mr Rat, I can tell this is a big concern to you, but it is of no business to me. I cannot be bothered with it.\"\nThe rat turned to the pig and told him: \"There is a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!\"\"I am so very sorry, Mr. Rat,\" sympathized the pig, \"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. I will make sure that you are in my prayers.\"\nThe rat turned to the cow. She said, \"Like wow, Mr. Rat. A rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?\"\nSo the rat returned to the house, head down and _ , to face the farmer's rat trap alone.\nThat very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey  . The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife.\nThe farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet   to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient.\nHis wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer killed the pig.\nThe farmer's wife did not get well. She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow killed to provide meat for all of them to eat.\nSo the next time you hear that someone is facing a problem and think that it does not concern you, remember that when there is a rat trap in the house, the whole farmyard is at risk."

      "Last month my family, my husband and I visited the zoo in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was afraid I just couldn't hide my excitement as it had been five years since I had been to the zoo. I was especially excited about getting to see the penguin exhibit that was completed since my last visit. I thought it would be just as magical as it was the last time.\nThe Tulsa Zoo is located on Mohawk Park, and covers 84 acres, making it the third largest zoo in the US. The zoo has several highlights, but I have to admit that I found myself rather disappointed. The maintenance is deeply lacking, and most of the exhibits, landscaping, etc. looked like it had not been updated or well kept. Unfortunately, their polar bear died a short time ago. The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere. The cafe served very good food and had lovely indoor and outdoor areas for eating. They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars."

      "Due to the increasing number of violence acts produced in schools all over the world,more and more parents prefer to have their children educated at home rather than at school. This way they can assure their safety and well-being,although teachers and school representatives are trying to improve the situation in schools by increasing the number of the persons in charge with the safety of the students.\nThe main reason for violence acts are the films and cartoons that fill the children's time.They want to do everything.they watch on TV and never think at the consequences,and they may hurt a classmate or a teacher.\nOn the other hand, parents are not fully satisfied with the children's results obtained in classes and they consider private classes would have better results.\nWhen a teacher has to watch 30 students in class he can't probably see what each of them is doing,how he is writing,or if he understands the explanations.At home the teacher can explain in details everything the child doesn't understand as many times as he considers proper.\nAnd many times.the child grows fond of the teacher at home,who becomes his best friend,and who helps him whenever he needs someone to talk to.\nHowever, the best solution would be a mixture between the education received at school and that at home,because school makes children communicate and socialize.Keeping a child at home for fear there might happen something bad to him.only makes the child's character weak and prevents him from knowing what real life is.Staying in _ only does harm to the child.\nAll in all.schools have been created to help children,not to harm them,so it's best to keep children in these special places,where they learn,laugh,have fun and make new friends."

      "Ever since the global economic recession( ) began in 2008,many Americans have changed their lifestyles by downsizing what they buy and what they possess.\nTammy Strobel and her husband used to own a two-bedroom apartment,two cars and had good incomes. But Tammy wasn't happy.Inspired by a web site,they began donating some of their belongings to charity, and eventually got rid of their cars.Some thought they were crazy,but now they feel much happier.Without debt and working fewer hours,now they have more time to be outdoors and to volunteer.\n\"The idea that you need to go bigger to be happy is false,\"Ms. Strobel says. \"I really believe that the acquisition of material goods doesn't bring about happiness.\"\nDespite the fact that the economy is not as booming as it was,studies have shown that many are feeling happier as they save more and spend less.This mainly happens when they spend money on experiences instead of material objects and when they relish what they plan to buy long before they buy it.\nIt is true that extra cash always makes life a little easier because it lets people meet basic needs.But scholars have found that types of purchases,their size and frequency,and even the timing of the spending all affect long-term happiness.One major finding is that spending money for an experience---concert tickets,French lessons, sushi-rolling classes---produces longer-lasting satisfaction.\nAt the height of the recession in 2008,consumers were doing something different---vacationing in their yards, eating more dinners at home,organizing family game nights .As a result, these leisure activities appeared to make them less lonely and increased their interactions with others.\n\"I think people are realizing they don't need what they had.They're more interested in creating memories,\"says a scholar.\nTo stop purchasing things using credit cards at any time brings happiness,too;in other words,waiting for something and working hard to get it makes it feel more valuable and more stimulating. In fact,scholar have found that anticipation increases happiness. Considering buying an i-Pad?You might want to think about it as long as possible before taking one home.\nMs.Strobel is now an advocate  of simple living.\"My lifestyle now would not be possible if I still had a huge two-bedroom apartment filled to the gills with stuff,two cars,and 30 grand  in debt,\"she says. \"Give away some of your stuff,\" she advises. \"See how it feels.\""

      "Mrs. Packletide intended to shoot a tiger. Not that the desire to kill had suddenly come to her, or that she felt she would leave India safer with one wild beast less. It was because Loona Bimberton had recently taken a plane to the forest and killed a tiger, and the newspapers showed photographs of Loona Bimberton with a tiger-skin on. In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\"\nMiss Mebbin possessed the pretty weekend cottage. Mrs. Packletide lost interest in animal-hunting.\n\"The extra expenses are so heavy,\" she said to inquiring friends."

      "A long time before I was born, my grandma and grandpa had a young family of four little girls. During the Great Depression  , work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. On weekends he and Grandma dug a garden to grow some of their own food.\nEverybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food and enjoyed flowers from the garden. Grandma put up strawberry jam, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches in canning jars. They were good to eat through the long winter.\nThe family grew up, and grandparents grew old. It became hard to keep up the garden, so they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy.\nThen one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was watch from his lawn chair as the vegetables grew and the roses bloomed. Summer slowly faded, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest.\nIt was a lonely winter for Grandma. She sat near the window, looking out at the yard and wondering if she could plant a garden in the spring. When spring came, she planted only a little garden.\nOne sunny day in the early summer, Grandma heard a commotion   in the front yard and looked out the window to see a frightening sight. A huge swarm of bees filled the air between two tall trees. The buzzing sound was very loud.\nThe bees made their way into a hole up in one of the trees. Before long, every one of those bees had disappeared into its new home. During the next few days, the bees were busy minding their own business. Grandma could always see a few bees buzzing in and out around the opening high in the tree. Before long, she decided the bees weren't bothering anyone, so she didn't give them another thought.\nThat summer, Grandma's little garden grew and grew. _ \nOne day, Grandma's brother Frank visited from Arizona. As Grandma made Frank a delicious lunch of squash cakes and homemade applesauce, she told him the story about the swarm of bees. Frank said, \"In Arizona, the farmers often hired beekeepers to set up beehives near their fields. The bees pollinated   the crops and helped them to grow.\"\nThat was when Grandma realized that her bees had helped with her garden all summer. \"So that's why my little garden had such a big crop!\" she exclaimed.\nFrom that time on, Grandma always believed that since Grandpa couldn't be there to help her that summer, he had sent the bees to take his place and make Grandma's little garden grow and grow."

      "Apple is offering a new tool that lets potential buyers a used iPhone, iPad, and iPod know if the devices were previously stolen.\nThe new Activation Lock Status tool, available through the company's iCloud service, allows users to enter the device's serial number and see if used devices are currently locked down or have ever been locked down by a previous owner, which would indicate the device was stolen. The reason behind the feature? Few customers would buy stolen devices, especially ones they can't use, so thieves will be deterred from stealing them in the first place.\nApple introduced its \"kill switch\" feature with iOS 7 last September. Using the Find My iPhone app and iCloud. corn, users can track their phone's location, in case it was accidentally left somewhere. Or, for those who believe their phone was stolen, they can enable the kill switch, which locks down the phone. The app can also delete all of its data in case the phone contains sensitive information. The only way to re-enable the device once it is locked down is to enter its associated Apple ID and password.\nHackers figured out a way to unlock mobile and tablet devices by tricking the device into using an alternative iCloud server, writes PC World. That's where the new Activation Lock Status tool comes in. Even if hackers are able to trick the device into unlocking, potential customers can check if the device was ever locked from the Find My iPhone feature.\nMobile devices have a high robbery rate. In California, 1 in every 3 robberies includes a mobile device, according to the Federal Communications Commission. For Oakland, Calif. , it's 75 percent of robberies. But Apple's locking feature has been extremely effective. In the months after the kill switch feature was released, iPhone thefts dropped 38 percent in San Francisco, according to a June law enforcement report. The robbery rate of Samsung phones, which don't have a kill switch feature, increased 12 percent.\nIn an attempt to cut down on the number of phones stolen across the state, California passed a law that will require all smartphones to have a kill switch system.\n\"Our efforts will effectively wipe out the incentive to steal smartphones and curb this crime of convenience, which is fueling street crime and violence within our communities,\" Sen. Mark Leno, who introduced the bill, said in a statement."

      "Attitudes to AIDS Now\nMost people say that the USA is making progress in fighting AIDS, but they don't know there's no cure and strongly disagree that \"the AIDS epidemic is over,\" a new survey finds.\nThe findings, released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, reassure activists who have worried that public concern about AIDS might disappear in light of recent news about advances in treatment and declines in deaths.\n \"While people are very optimistic about the advances, they're still realistic about the fact that there is no cure\" says Sophia Chang, director of HIV programs at the foundation.\n The Kaiser survey, like a recent USA TODAY Gallup Poll, does find that the number of people ranking AIDS as the country's top health problem has fallen. In the Kaiser Poll, 38% say it's the top concern, down from 44% in a 1996 poll; in the Gallup Poll, 29% say AIDS in No.1, down from 41% in 1992 and 67% in 1987.\n Other findings from Kaiser, which polled more than 1,200 adults in September and October and asked additional questions of another 1,000 adults in November:\n 52% say the country is making progress against AIDS, up from 32% in 1995.\n 52% say the government spends too little on AIDS.\n 86% correctly say AIDS drugs can now lengthen lives; an equal number correctly say that the drugs are not cures.\n 67% incorrectly say that AIDS deaths increased or stayed the same in the past year; 24% know deaths fell.\n Daniel Zingale, director of AIDS Action Council, says, \"I'm encouraged that the American people are getting the message that the AIDS epidemic isn't over. I hope the decision-makers in Washington are getting the same message... We have seen signs of complacency ."

      "Eight in 10 Americans eat fast food at least once a month and half eat it every week according, to a Gallup Poll. Yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here's something you may not know.\n2. Fast food is addictive.\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \"a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\" If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n4. Fast food \"burgers\" don't have much burger in them.\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad.\n5. Even \"healthy\" fast food isn't that healthy.\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \"healthy\" is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King, the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing, still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat, and nearly a day's worth of sodium.\n6. Fast food is inhumane to animals.\nOkay, this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you, but it's still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food. 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large factory farms resemble more of a \"business\" than a \"farm.\" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight. They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease, which runs rampant in these conditions. Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence, according to the UN.\n7. Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas, desserts, and many other products. Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study. Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar."

He measured his success by the number of people who fainted dead away after witnessing his death-defying feats. \nGrander,a blond Frenchman,toured North America in 1850,billing himself as \"Blondin\". Blondin's  gift was excellent balance. This talent. coupled with a great desire to surprise and shock his audiences,made Blondin an incomparable performer. \nHis most famous  _ was walking acrossprefix = st1 /Niagara Fallson a tightrope. Blondin's \"stage\" consisted of a rope tied 1,100 feet across the falls. The rope hung some 160 feet above the rocks and boiling water below the falls. \nSimply walking across the falls was not exciting enough for Blondin;he later had to ride across on a bicycle. Then,in another performance,he calmly walked across blindfolded . At still another time,he carried his terrified manager on his back and walked over the falls before thousands of breathless audience. \nBut Blondin was undoubtedly his own worst critic. He was never satisfied with hfs act and always tried to attract his audience with his balancing feat. One of his most daring walks was made in the darkness of night. Blondin became so famous on his tour through North America that his last performance was attended by an admiring Prince of Wales."

      "Can storms in Africa cause asthma  in the Caribbean ? Islanders point to the desert insects that land on beaches after a 5,000-kilometer flight across the Atlantic. If they can use winds to get from one continent to another, so can clouds of dust that carry disease.\nScientists think that as Africa becomes drier, dust from expanding deserts is being blown away into Caribbean islands. A study in Barbados shows that asthma has increased 17 times since Africa's drought  began in 1973.\nOther forms of life are suffering, too. Among them are the Caribbean's famous coral reefs( ), which began dying in large numbers in the 1900s. Eugene Shinn of the U.S. Geiological Sudrvey(USGS) in Florida went to the virgin Islands to study the reefs. The tests he and his colleagues carried out showed that the coral was dying of disease caused by Africa microbes  from across the ocean.\nWilliam Sprigg of the University of Arizona is studying the problem as part of a major UN project. He says that dust is causing problems in the U.S., too.\n\"We are just beginning to collect the evidence of airborne  dust influences on human health,\" he toldThe Washington Post."

      "A few years ago, I took a sightseeing trip to Washington D.C. I saw many of our nation's treasures, and I also saw a lot of unfortunate people like beggars and homeless folks in the streets.\nStanding outside the Ronald Reagan Center, I heard a voice say, \"Can you help me?\" When I turned around, I saw an elderly blind woman with her hand extended . In a natural reaction, I reached into my pocket, pulled out all of my loose change and placed it in her hand. I didn't even look at her. I was annoyed at being bothered by a beggar.\nBut the blind woman smiled and said, \"I don't want your money. I just need help finding the post office.\"\nImmediately, I realized what I had done. I acted with prejudice --I judged another person simply for what I thought she was.\nThe thing I had forgotten about myself is that I am an immigrant. I left Honduras and arrived in America at the age of 15. Through the years, I have been a dishwasher, cashier, mechanic and pizza delivery driver among many other jobs, and finally I became a network engineer.\nIn my own life, I have experienced many open acts of prejudice. I remember a time, at age 17-- I was a busboy, and I heard a father tell his little boy that if he did not do well at school, he would end up like me.\nBut now, living in my American middle-class lifestyle, it is too easy to forget my past, to forget who I am and where I have been, and to lose sight of where I want to be going. That blind woman on the street of Washington D.C. cured me of my blindness. She reminded me to always keep my eyes and heart open."

      "In a mango orchard   outside a village there lived a mischievous   monkey. He kept on eating the ripe mangoes. The orchard keeper tried to trap the monkey. But every time, the monkey escaped from the trap.\nOne day, the monkey walked about and went into the nearby town. \"The town people are so busy. It is so crowded here,\" the monkey thought. Soon, the monkey was _ and running away with food. By evening, he had made life quite different for the town people. \"The town is more fun than the orchard. I will stay here,\" he thought. Days went by, and the monkey was considered by the town people as something very frightening. \"Here he comes again!\" they screamed when they saw the monkey.\nOne day, a juggler   came to the town. The people of the town went to him. \"We want you to help us get rid of the monkey,\" they said to the juggler. The juggler said in return, \"Do not worry. Get me some jars   with narrow necks.\" When the jars were brought to him, he put some peanuts into them and placed them out of a field. The monkey became curious when he saw the peanuts. \"Yummy! Let me quickly get the peanuts and run,\" he thought. He put his hand inside a jar and grabbed a big handful of peanuts. But he could not pull out of his clenched fist  , as the neck of the jar was so narrow. If the monkey had dropped some of the peanuts back into the jar, he could have pulled his hand out. But he was greedy. So he didn't drop any of the peanuts. The town people trapped the monkey with his hand inside the jar. They got hold of a rope and tied him to a post. Then the monkey was sold to a zoo. That was the end of the greedy monkey."

      "Learning English well is a great challenge, but with the help from technology  it can be as easy as a piece of cake.\nAs well as the classroom, teachers and textbooks, the Internet, TV and radio programs can play an active role in helping learn English. The Internet is full of rich and up-to-date information. English learners might wish to try http://www.in2english.com.cn. It provides cultural information about Britain.\nAnother useful website for middle school students and teachers is: Besides reading 21st Century School Edition online, students are also invited to put their views on different topics up on the website.\nCompared with the Internet, TV programs have their own advantages : one does not have to sit at a computer and one can hear and watch the programs much better.\nOne popular English-learning program is called \"Modern English\". This focuses on spoken English in practical situations such as taking photos and shopping.\nIf you watch Beijing Television Channel 8, you might see a program titled \"Study Abroad\". Cartoons are used to explain how to use the word in daily life. Listening to the radio may not be a new way to learn English but it is easy.\nChina Radio International airs a program called \"Studio Classroom\" at 6:30 a.m. every day. This 25-minute program is aimed at middle school students and covers subjects from current news to travel and history, all in simple language."

I classify   them according to how well I know them and how well they know me.\nThe first type of friend is just an acquaintance  .This means that you only know their name. You might not even remember what they look like if you go away for a short vacation. You don't miss them when they are elsewhere. It is also this type of friend who gives you the most amount of aggravation  .Since most of the time you are placed in a position where you have to act friendly. You would not normally tell an acquaintance when he or she is doing something that makes you feel angry,such as tapping the fingers on a table or shouting loudly. I call them \"pest friends\".\nThe second kind of friend is a \"guest friend\".They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs. You don't talk too often with this sort of friend,and you don't share each other's secrets.\nLastly,we have  \"best friends\".This sort of friend is there when you need them. They know you as a person and they are there through thick and thin. Best friends are the ones that you can lean and depend on no matter what happens.

Several weeks into the course my teacher came to me,saying,\"I think you should withdraw from this course. It seems to be too hard for you. \"\nThat was the day I learned I wasn't smart enough to become a nurse. With shame. I handed in my Latin textbook.\nAfter high school,the years raced by.

      "An old problem is getting new attention in the United States--bullying. Recent cases included the tragic case of a 15-year-old girl whose family moved from Ireland. She hanged herself in Massachusetts following months of bullying. Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her. Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers.\nJudy Kuczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA. Her daughter Tina was also the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota. She said,\"Our daughter was a very outgoing child. She was involved in all kinds of things and had lots of friends. And over a period of time her grades fell completely. She started having health issues. She couldn't sleep. She wasn't eating. She had terrible stomach pains and didn't want to go to school.\"\nBullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence, or it can be verbal--for example, insults or threats. Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying.\nAnd now there is cyber-bullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages. It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time.\nThe first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s. The latest government study in the United States was released last year. It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school.\nSusan Swearer is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network. She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need. She says bullying is connected to depression, anxiety and anti-social behavior and bullies are often victims themselves."

Teens would socialize 24/7 if they could.\nRyerson calls it _ -- round-the-clock reports on breaking news about everything, from homework to wardrobe choices to ice-cream cravings.\nSleep deprivation is linked to memory and concentration problems, anxiety and depression, and moodiness.\"Many people assume these problems arise directly from adolescence, which is not really true,\" he says.\"The real issue is sleep deprivation.Late-night texting can certainly make the situation worse.\"\n\"The psychology behind this constant contact is certainly understandable,\" Ryerson says.\"It comes from wanting to avoid being left out.They won't be considered important and significant in their peer group, if they don't know what's going on.If they're on top of everything, they belong,\" she says.\n\"What helps, at least for younger kids,\" says Ryerson, \"is parental involvement.If all of their friends are all able to text into the early hours of the night, it is hard for a middle or high schooler to set the limit themselves.Often they appreciate parents stepping in.\"\n\"As parents, we want our kids to be happy, healthy and responsible,\" she says, \"and the most necessary requirement for achieving balance is to first take care of ourselves physically -- eating well, exercising and getting enough sleep.\""

      "From self-driving cars to carebots (care+robots) for elderly people, rapid development in technology has long represented a possible threat to many jobs normally performed by people. But experts now believe that almost 50 percent of occupations existing today will be completely unnecessary by 2025 as artificial intelligence continues to change businesses.\n\"The next fifteen years will see a revolution in how we work, and a revolution will necessarily take place in how we plan and think about workplaces,\" said Peter Andrew, Director of Workplace Strategy for CBRE Asia Pacific.\nA growing number of jobs in the future will require creative intelligence, social skills and the ability to use artificial intelligence.\nThe report is based on interviews with 200 experts, business leaders and young people from Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. It shows that in the US technology already destroys more jobs than it creates.\nBut the report states: \"Losing occupations does not necessarily mean losing jobs -- just changing what people do.\" Growth in new jobs could occur as much, according to the research.\n\"The growth of 20 to 40 person companies that have the speed and technological know-how will directly challenge big companies,\" it states.\nA 2014 report by Pew Research found 52 percent of experts in artificial intelligence and robotics were optimistic about the future and believed there would still be enough jobs in the next few years. The optimists pictured \"a future in which robots do not take the place of more jobs than they create,\" according to Aaron Smith, the report's co-author.\n\"Technology will continue to affect jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created. Although there have always been unemployed people, when we reached a few billion people there were billions of jobs. There is no shortage of things that need to be done and that will not change,\" Microsoft's Jonathan Grudin told researchers."

      "Human remains of ancient settlements will be reburied and lost to science under a law that threatens research into the history of humans in Britain, a group of leading archaeologists  says. In a letter addressed to the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, 40 archaeologists write of their \"deep and widespread concern\" about the issue. It centers on the law introduced by the Ministry of Justice in 2008 which requires all human remains unearthed in England and Wales to be reburied within two years, regardless of their age. The decision means scientists have too little time to study bones and other human remains of national and cultural significance.\n\"Your current requirement that all archaeologically unearthed human remains should be reburied, whether after a standard period of two years or further special extension, is contrary to basic principles of archaeological and scientific research and of museum practice,\" they write.\nThe law applies to any pieces of bone uncovered at around 400 dig sites, including the remains of 60 or so bodies found at Stonehenge in 2008 that date back to 3,000 BC. Archaeologists have been granted a temporary extension to give them more time, but eventually the bones will have to be returned to the ground.\nThe arrangements may result in the waste of future discoveries at sites such as Happisburgh in Norfolk, where digging is continuing after the discovery of stone tools made by early humans 950,000 years ago. If human remains were found at Happisburgh, they would be the oldest in northern Europe and the first indication of what this species was. Under the current practice of the law those remains would have to be reburied and effectively destroyed.\nBefore 2008, guidelines allowed for the proper preservation and study of bones of sufficient age and historical interest, while the Burial Act 1857 applied to more recent remains. The Ministry of Justice assured archaeologists two years ago that the law was temporary, but has so far failed to revise it.\nMike Parker Pearson, an archaeologist at Sheffield University, said: \"Archaeologists have been extremely patient because we were led to believe the ministry was sorting out this problem, but we feel that we cannot wait any longer.\"\nThe ministry has no guidelines on where or how remains should be reburied, or on what records should be kept."

Her eyes weren't straight. Her glasses were an inch thick. And she had really strange teeth. Every day kids shouted insults at Amy. They would say, \"God, what a strange face! Stop looking at me!\" \nFor a while I shouted insults at Amy too, just so I could fit in. After all, I didn't want the other kids treating me the same as they treated Amy. But it made me sad to insult her. I could see that the insults were making her feel ashamed and lonely. I began to pity her. Then I wanted to stand up for her. I didn't know how to stop my schoolmates insulting Amy until the night of our class skating party.\nOur whole class was there, including Amy. Amy didn't know how to skate, but I could see how much she wanted to have fun like the rest of us. So I skated over to her and took her by the hand. Holding her hand, I slowly pulled her, and together we began the journey around the skating rink. I didn't say a word to her, and she didn't speak to me. She just smiled, and every once in a while she would laugh in excitement.\nThe next morning, on the school bus the other kids talked a lot about Amy and me. But nobody insulted her or me. And they didn't do that for the rest of the year. When the school year ended, my family moved away, and I never heard of Amy again. But I've always hoped that I changed her life for the better.\nShe changed my life as well.

      "China Daily---Last week, the Beijing municipal government released a list of 192 areas in the capital where spring blooms, including peach, magnolia, apricot and winter jasmine, can be enjoyed from March to May.  The recommended spots cover an area of 22 square kilometers.  Apart from admiring blooms, folklore performances, botany exhibitions and other activities will be put on. 20 travel routes for tourists looking to appreciate floral beauty in the countryside are issued in Hubei, too.\nSouth Korean drama Descendants of the Sun<<>>  has collected more than 200 million views on iQiyi, the Chinese streaming website said Tuesday.\n\"Descendants of the Sun\", the first Korean show to premiere simultaneously in South Korea and China  , is a love story between an Army captain (Song Joong-ki) and a doctor (Song Hye-kyo) who find themselves in a fictional war-torn country called Uruk, where both try to save lives.\n\"The show has become the talk of the town everywhere. Some shows even had live phone conversations with viewers to discuss its popularity,\" a Chinese entertainment official said.\nTo put things into perspective, a f ifth of South Korea's population is 10 million people. Just a little over that number tuned in to watch Descendants of the Sun.\nEnthusiastic customers snapped up  the first batch of tickets in just five minutes on Monday for the opening day of the Shanghai Disneyland park on June 16, temporarily crashing the official website.\n\"Within half an hour, clicks on the website (www.shanghaidisneyresort.com) reached more than 5 million. The massive volume resulted in our ticketing system temporarily malfunctioning.\""

      "Last week I did something that scared me. I stood in front of nearly 200 financial planners and I talked to them about why financial blogs are a good thing.\nI'm a confident writer. I've been doing this long enough that I know my strength and my limitations. I'm less confident as a speaker. I don't have time to pause to collect my thoughts. I'm not able to edit. I'm afraid of being trapped in a corner without being able to talk my way out. Basically, I'm scared to speak.\nIt would be easy to simply refuse the chances that come my way. When somebody asks me to speak in front of a group, I could say \"no\". When radio and television stations call for an interview, I could say \"no\". But for the past two years, I've been following _ to say \"yes\" to new chances.\nTo say \"yes\" is to live in fear. My goal is to continually improve myself to become better than I am today. One way to do that is to do the things that scare me, to take them on as challenges, and to learn from them -- even if I fail.\nIn mid-November, a local station asked me to appear on live television. \"I realize it's short notice,\" the producer wrote, \"but we'd love to have you on the show if you're available tonight.\" I was frightened. I thought about recent taped television interviews that I had hated. I was afraid of what might happen.\nBut I also thought about the things that had gone right. I thought of how my speaking skills had improved over the past year. And then I thought of the book I was reading, a book that I had bought for $1.29 at the local store. The Magic of Thinking Big was a huge bestseller during the 1960s. Written by Dr. David Schwartz, a professor at Georgia State University, the book contains dozens of practical tips on how to take risks to achieve big goals. Schwartz argues that nobody will believe in you until you believe in yourself.\nSo when the television producer asked if I wanted to appear on his show, I thought big. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I'll do it.\" I acted confidently, but on the inside I was frightened. What I needed was techniques to build up my confidence and to overcome my fear."

      "The Golden Gate Bridge joins the beautiful city of san Francisco with the suburbs   to the north. Each day, about one hundred thousand cars cross the bridge, taking people to and from the city. More than half of them cross the bridge during the morning and evening rush hours. As a result, the trip is not pleasant.\nNow, however, there is at least one group of happy commuters  . These are the people who travel under the bridge instead of on it. They go to work by boat and enjoy it so much that most of them say they will never go by car again.\nThe boat they take is the large, quiet, comfortable \"Golden Gate\". Commuters can enjoy the sun on the boat. In the morning they can have breakfast in the coffee shop, and in the evening they can have a drink in the bar while they are looking at San Francisco's famous scene and the nearby hills.\nThe trip takes only thirty minutes and is not expensive. But best of all, being on a boat seems to make people feel friendlier towards each other. Two commuters who met on the \"Golden Gate\" have already got married.\nBecause the boat had been so successful, there are plans to use other, still larger boats. There is also a plan for a high-speed boat that will make the trip in only fifteen minutes. Not everyone is happy about that. \"A lot of people don't want to get the trip faster,\" said one commuter, \"They feel that an hour is just enough time to rest.\""

      "For many years, no one could communicate with people who had been born without learning. These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language.\nBut, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.\nHow did this sign language work?  The deaf were taught to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. A man might move his finger across his lips. This meant, \"You are not telling the truth.\" He might tap his chin (, )with three fingers. This meant \"my uncle\".\nThe deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.\nSign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once could. Today, the deaf are taught to understand others by watching their lips. They are also taught how to speak."

But as a girl, I once thought that I could never play basketball.\nI like playing basketball though I'm not good at it. I've had a basketball since I was a child. At first, I could play freely because no one cared when I was just a kid. But as I grew up it seemed harder and harder for me to enjoy basketball.\nAt school, it was always the boys who played basketball during P.E. classes. The girls were only allowed to play volleyball or badminton.\nMy parents did not let me play basketball at home. \"Basketball is not for girls,\" they said. Even when I went to play basketball with my friends, boys stared at me on the court as if I were an alien.\nI was feeling down and had hope of playing basketball. Unexpectedly, something changed the first day of high school. I made some friends who also enjoyed playing basketball. They encouraged me to get back on the court.\nOne of them told me with a smile, \"Go your own way, let others talk.\" This girl would always play basketball with me. Even the boy who sat next to me in class talked about basketball with me almost every day.\nI was inspired by them. Confidence and passion   returned to my heart. I am ready to stand up and play. I will play as well as I can, and for me, even the sky is boundless.\nBasketball has become an important part of my life. I am interested in it. I watch and play almost every day. Through basketball, not only do I feel happy and confident, but also learn a lot.\nI have heard the NBA star Tracy McGrady say \"Nothing is impossible.\" It is from an advertisement on TV. I have come to realize that life is just like playing basketball. You should have an aim. After that, just be confident and keep going.

      "When you grow up, could you imagine your parents choosing your husband or wife for you? Besides, can you imagine not setting eyes on him or her until your wedding day? This situation is common in India, the Middle East and many parts of Africa. Marriage customs around the world often differ from our own. We don't realize that people in other places often get married in very different ways--and with different motives.\nIn many countries, marriage is a practical matter. A marriage provides a safe and stable home for the husband and wife. It also joins two families, which benefits the couple's parents and makes them happy. Marriage also brings children, making sure the couple will be taken care of in old age. Because marriage is important for the whole family, some cultures don't let young people choose whom to marry.\nJust as there are many different reasons for marriage, there are also many different wedding _ . Every culture has its own ways of bringing good luck to the happy couple. In a typical Western wedding, the bride seeks good luck by wearing \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\" Something old represents the past. Something new represents success in the future. Something borrowed reminds the bride she can get help from her friends and family. And something blue reminds her to be true to her husband.\nIn Poland, one wedding tradition is not only lucky, but also very practical. The wedding guests pin money to the bride's dress while she is dancing. The money is meant to bring luck and to help the young couple build their new life. In Bermuda, the young couple plant a tree in the yard of their new home. Once they move in, they take good care of the tree and make it grow. The planting of the tree is a good metaphor  for marriage. A truly good marriage is something that grows with care."

      "On Saturday, Feb 12, 2000, two things happened that changed my life.\nFirst of all, my baby sister got married. She was 26 this day, and yet to me she was still my baby sister.\nI was happy, but also sad. Gone were the days of me bossing  her around. My bossy behavior had once earned me the nickname Lucy. If you're a fan of Peanuts, then you can clearly imagine my behavior as an older sister.\nAt one point, I left the wedding reception to get some air. I went outside and walked to a nearby playground. I'm not sure how long I sat there before my sister came and joined me. We talked about how we were both grown up. As she wiped a tear from my eye, she lovingly said, \"You'll always be Lucy to me.\" We hugged.\nThen, my cousin Mike walked over to tell us that it was time to cut the cake, and the second thing that changed my life that day came to pass.\n\"Hey, did you guys hear that Charles Schulz died today?\" he said casually - as if it were no big deal. Then he took my sister's arm and they turned to head back to the reception hall. \"Coming?\" they asked. \"In a minute,\" I replied, and I sat back down on the bench, dizzy from what Mike had just told me.\nHow could Charles Schulz be dead? He was my creator! He was almost like a father to me!\nI had lost so many things on that day. My innocence had slipped away like a thief in the night. It was gone before I could do anything about it, taking with it all the treasures that I had held in my heart. I felt myself grow up in an instant. I saw, for the first time, what I really was - a 30-year-old woman with a husband of my own, and soon, a child of my own.\nI took a deep breath and stood up from the bench. I turned and headed back to the hall, hoping I hadn't missed the cutting of the cake. It was the day that my sister grew wings of her own and left the nest - the day that _ ."

      "American and British use different greetings. In the USA the commonest greeting is \"Hi\". In Britain it is \"Hello!\" or \"How are you?\". \"Hi!\" is creeping into British, too. When they are introduced to someone, the Americans say, \"Glad to know you.\" The British say, \"How do you do?\" or \"Pleased to meet you.\" When Americans say \"Goodbye\", they nearly always add, \"Have a good day,\" or \"Have a good trip,\" etc. to friends and strangers alike. Britons are already beginning to use \"Have a good day\". \nThe British usually use \"got\"in the sense of \"have\". The Americans hardly ever do.\nAm.E: Do you have a car, room,etc.?Yes, I do.\nBr.E: Have you got a car, room, etc.? Yes, I have.\nFinally, there are a number of differences between American and British English in the spelling of words, e.g.check(US)/cheque(UK); center(US)/centre(UK). Many American words ending in \"or\", e.g. honor, vigor, labor are spelt in British English with an \"our\", e.g. honour, vigour, labour. Many verbs in American English with \"ize\"or \"izing\" forms, e.g. organize, realizing are spelt in Br.E \"ise\"or \"ising\",e.g.organise,realising.In American English, \"practice\"is used both for the verb and noun.In Br.E, the verb is spelt \"practise\", and the noun \"practice\". In the main, American English  avoids the doubling up of consonants in nouns and verbs while British English does not.In American English, for example, one writes \"travel, traveled, traveling, traveler,\" while in British English, one writes  \"travel, travelled, travelling, traveller\".\nIt was once predicted that British and American English would became separate languages finally. But the opposite has happened. The links between the two countries are so strong that linguistically , and probably culturally too, they are closer together than ever."

      "Downing Street sources have indicated that the British tennis player,Andy Murray,will be Recommended for a knighthood for ending Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's champion title.David Cameron,the British prime minister,who was in the royal box on Sunday at Wimbledon told reporters that he couldn't think of anyone who deserves one more.More news on the knighthood is surely to come, but Murray's achievement has a _ in that he is Scottish, not English.\nAlso in the royal box show on Sunday was Scotland's  first minister, Alex Salmond, waving the white-and-blue Scottish flag in the row directly behind Cameron after the victory.No Scotsman had won the singles at Wimbledon since Harold Mahony in 1896.Salmond was later asked on BBC Radio whether Murray's achievement had been a victory for Britain. \"Absolutely,and for tennis fans everywhere,\"Salmond said.\"Let everyone enjoy the victory.But you will allow us just the little private thing.Let us wave our national flag.\"\nThe Scottish government,headed by Salmond,has announced that Scotland will hold a referendum on independence from Britain in September 2014.Murray,who lives in the  London area but was born and raised in the Scottish town of Dunblane,has not said publicly which way he would vote on the issue,and his Wimbledon Championship will only mix interest in his views.\nBut this was a national moment.Murray's semifinal victory over Jerzy\nJanowicz drew a peak television audience of 13.24 million viewers,  the biggest of the year in Britain.The final then topped that with a peak audience of 17.3 million,the biggest audience for a Wimbledon final since at least 1990, according to the B BC.\nOnly one name will go on the trophy ,but tennis at the highest level has now become a team event.Murray,who once had frequent fits of anger during matches,has transformed himself into a much more focused force with the help of an extensive support group.Murray's rise to champion has clearly  something to do with his decision to hire the former number one tennis champion Ivan Lendl as his coach just before the 2012 season.\"He's been very patient with me; I'm just happy I managed to do it for him.\"\nOnward Team Murray goes toward a defense of the United States Open title,beginning next month,and then eventually to defending at Wimbledon next year with the British drought   well and truly over."

      "We can make all the jokes we want about taking baths ourselves, but if we are ill in bed and can't get up, we'll be thankful to the nurses who help us get clean. While I am not a nurse, and have never given anyone a bath, I would imagine that it would take a lot of sympathy   and patience to do so.\nYet those who attended the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems last month were introduced to Cody, a robot that can bathe human beings.\nThe robot has a base that can be turned to all directions, two humanlike arms, and movable wrists  . It uses a camera to locate parts of the human body.  It then uses bath gloves to clean with a little pressure.\nThe robot was designed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Charles Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab is the senior researcher for the project. In a test run, Cody   was able to remove 96% of a test subject's dirt--not bad  for a robot.\nBut don't go asking for Cody yet--he's still a model.  Yet researchers believe that one day Cody may take the  place of nurses for this task.  Researchers say that Cody  will give patients dignity and protect their personal information. I suppose that would depend on the patient.  I'm  not sure whether a robot using a camera would make me  feel very dignified.\nEven so, I can appreciate the need.  We don't have  enough nurses to go around, and those places that are the  most shorthanded, for example, nursing homes, are those  that have the most patients who are unable to bathe themselves. Still, before I get there, I hope they think of a better way to solve the problem."

      "As a high school athletics coach, I gave a speech about football to students and parents, aiming at getting new team members :I talked  about how\"everyone  can benefit from football. This year, a worried-looking couple approached me. Their son, who had a sickly childhood, really wanted to play football. They'd tried to talk him out of it, but he had his heart set on joining the team.\nWhen they told me his name , my heart sank. Michael was short and thin. He was a lonely kid and the constant target of other kids' jokes. I knew Michael would never make it. But so close to my  \"football is for everyone\"  speech,  I told them we could give it a try.\nOn the opening day of practice, Michael was the first player on the field. We started a one-mile jog around the track. Repeatedly he fell, each time picking himself up. The same thing happened for weeks. But Michael put his whole heart into the training. Cradually, Michael gained strength both socially and physically. He began to laugh and most of the teammates became friendly. By the last week of practice Michael could run the mile without falling. He asked me to add a few more exercises he could work on his own. Soon ,  Michael ran the opening mile faster than anyone.\nOne day after practice, the team captain, Steve, came up to me. He was talented but lazy.He was popular with students even though he could be heartless. Steve pointed to the field where Michael was jogging all alone and asked me why he was still out there. I told Steve to ask him. The next night, I was surprised to see Steve exercising right next to Michael.\nFinally our big game came-at first we were losing by twelve points. I could see that some kids  had already lost heart. But Michael was playing as hard as he could ,  begging the team to keep trying. Finally we won the game by one point in the final ten seconds.\nAt our celebration dinner, we always gave a big award to the most productive player. Steve had scored the most points that season,  and everyone cheered as he received his award. \" There's someone who deserves it more than I do,\"  Steve said,  \" Everything I accomplished,  and everything the team accomplished this season, is thanks to one person-Michael. \" The entire team cheered as Steve turned the prize over to the player who had inspired them all."

      "He's not just a pretty face! Famous actor Josh Duhamel leads a group of youngsters in a two-mile charity beach run. He may be an attractive movie star, but there's more to Josh Duhamel than a pretty face. The 40-year-old actor led a youth charity fun run for the third year running on Sunday, in aid of the Red Cross giving a hand to countries and places suffering natural disasters.\nJosh sported the charity's T-shirt and black baseball cap with black jogging bottoms as he joined a group of youngsters in the two-mile effort on Santa Monica Beach. Josh was clearly enjoying himself today, sprinting across the finish line raising both arms in a victory salute.\nIn March last year and January of 2010, Josh led thousands of runners and raised over $200,000 for both Japanese and Haitian earthquake relief efforts. And donations collected at this year's Youth Run will go towards the American Red Cross PrepareSoCal campaign which helps Southern Californians get ready for disasters.\n\"I do the youth run because I feel that younger people may not be able to donate a lot of money but that doesn't mean that they can't contribute and make a difference,\" Josh told the Red Cross website. \"Bringing students of L. A. together for these events not only raises a lot of money, but also raises the spirits of those affected by any disaster and helps everyone young and old.\"\nDuhamel had won the title of Male Model of the Year in an International Modeling and Talent Association competition in 1997. Duhamel began his acting career as an extra in the music videos for Donna Summer's song, \"I Will Go With You\" in 1998. Later that year, he won the role of Leo Pres on the ABC soap opera \"All My Children\". He then began appearing in films, and his acting in the film \"Transformers\" as well as its sequels was so successful that he became a pop film star."

Robby said that it had always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano, so I took him on as a student.\nRobby tried and tried while I listened and encouraged him and gave him more instructions. But he just did not have any inborn ability.\nI only saw his mother from a distance. She always waved and smiled but never came in.  Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling him but I guessed he had decided to try something else.\nI was also glad that he stopped coming for the sake of my career. However, several weeks before the recital   of my students, Robby came,telling me that he never stopped practicing and begged me to allow him to take part in it. I agreed, but I made him perform last in the program, so I could save his poor performance through my \"curtain closer\".\nI was surprised when he announced that he had chosen one piece of Mozart's. However, never had I heard a piece of Mozart's played so well by someone at his age. \nI ran up and put my arms around Robby in joy. \"I've never heard you play like that, Robby! How could you do it?\"\n\"Well, Miss Hondorf. Do you remember I told you my mom was sick? Actually she died this morning. She was born deaf, so tonight was the first time she could hear me play.

      "When was the last time you did something really fun with one of your parents--just the two of you?\nParents who take their young children to music, swimming and art classes often stop arranging such activities once their kids are older and in school all day. But it doesn't have to be that way. Doing something enjoyable with your kids just might make you look at each other in a whole new way, especially if you do it through a class or an event. When parent and child become students together, it puts them on the same level, at least for a while.\n\"I really like parents to come to class with their kids--they start sharing things and talking about what they're doing and what they like,\" said art teacher Pyper Dixon.\nHowever, finding something new in common is a big choice for them, especially when kids get involved in sports and other after-school activities. But it's possible to learn a new skill or hobby together.\nThat's certainly true of Lauren, 11, of Silver Spring, who is in Dixon's class with her father, Dennis. \"I was just going to drop her off,\" Dennis said, \"but Dixon persuaded me to stay.\"\nNow Lauren gets to _ her father about doing his art homework. \"He always leaves it to the last minute,\" she said. \"But then he'll turn around to do amazing drawings,\" she added, \"We have different styles of drawing, so it's interesting to talk it over with him.\"\nWithout the Saturday morning art class, Dennis said, he would be reading the paper, and Lauren would be on her own in her room or on the computer. But they talk more now. \"I can't think of an experience where you communicate with your kid so closely,\" he said."

      "I believe that animals possess greater intelligence than most people think. But plants? I've never considered the possibility of plant intelligence.  The idea seems absurd .\nYet I've had friends argue that plant intelligence might exist. \"What are the differences between plants and animals?\" they ask, and then they argue about certain species that seem to share the intelligence of both plants and animals. \nNew research suggests that plants communicate via \"networks\". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.\nRecent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.\nMany herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?\nRecently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars. Thanks to this early warning system, the plants can stay one step ahead of their attackers. The research has shown that this significantly limits the damage to the plants.\nAgain, I don't believe this reflects intelligence,"

      "In Egyptian myth, Apophis was the ancient spirit of evil and destruction, a demon   that was determined to throw the world into darkness forever. A fitting name, astronomers reasoned, for a threat now rushing towards Earth from outer space. Scientists are monitoring the progress of a 390-metere wide asteroid   discovered last year, which is potentially on a collision  course with the planet.\nNASA has estimated that Apophis has an outside chance of hitting the Earth in 2036. If it did hit us, thousands of square kilometers would be directly affected by the explosion but the whole of the Earth would see the effects of the dust sent into the atmosphere. At a recent meeting of experts in Near-Earth objects (NEOs) in London, scientists said it could take decades to design, test and build the required technology to _ the asteroid.\nThe Apophis asteroid is placed at four out of ten on the Torino scale--a measure of the threat caused by an NEO where 10 is a certain collision which could cause a global disaster. This is the most possible danger of any asteroid in recorded history and it has a 1 in 37 chance of hitting the Earth.\nAlan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer from Queen's University Belfast, said, \"When it does pass close to us on April 13, 2029, the Earth will deflect it and change its orbit. There is a small possibility that if it passes through a particular point in space, the so-called keyhole, the Earth's gravity will change things so that when it comes back around again in 2036, it will collide with us.\" The chance of Apophis passing through the keyhole, a 600-meter patch of space, is 1 in 5,500, based on current information.\nThere is no shortage of ideas on how to deflect asteroids. The Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency has led the effort in designing a range of satellites and rockets to nudge asteroids that are on a collision course for Earth into a different orbit."

      "When you are invited to attend a party in the West, the first important thing you need to know is that you should arrive late.\nIt is a great embarrassment to arrive at a party early or even on time. Therefore, unless you are the host of the party, you never want to be the first person present at a party. Why? Because others may think that you have no life or nothing better to do than wait for a party to start. Many people try to project an image of always being busy, which, whether true or not, has something to do with success. So, by arriving late, you are implying: \"I live a full life and it's really exciting.\"\nTherefore, an 8 o'clock party usually doesn't really start until maybe 9 o'clock, as everyone wants to be thought of as a busy and important person with lots of things to do. In other words, a party is one of those rare occasions in which your _ can actually hurt you. It's quite a strange thing, isn't it? Anyhow, remember to be late!"

      "These days we are all conditioned to accept newness, whatever it costs. Very soon, there is no doubt that Apple's tablet   will seem as a vital tool of modern living to us as sewing machine did to our grandparents. At least, it will until someone produces an even smarter, thinner and more essential tablet, which, if recent history is any guide, will be in approximately six months' time. Turn your back for a moment and you find that every electronic item in your possession is as old as a tombstone. Why should you care if people laugh just because you use an old mobile phone? But try getting the thing repaired when it goes wrong. It's like walking into a pub and asking for an orange juice. You will be made to feel like some sort of time-traveler from the 1970s. \"Why not buy a new one?\" you will get asked.\nAnd so the mountain of electrical rubbish grows. An average British person was believed to get rid of quite a number of electronic goods in a lifetime. They weighed three tons, stood 7 feet high, and included five fridges, six microwaves, seven PCs, six TVs, 12 kettles, 35 mobile phones and so on. Even then, the calculation seemed to be conservative. Only 35 mobiles in a lifetime? The huge number of electronic items now regularly thrown away by British families is clearly one big problem. But this has other consequences. It contributes greatly to the uneasy feeling that modem technology is going by faster than we can keep up. By the time I've learnt how to use a tool it's already broken or lost. I've lost count of the number of TV remote-controls that I've bought, mislaid and replaced without working out what most of the buttons did.\nAnd the technology changes so unbelievably fast. It was less than years ago that I spotted an energetic businessman friend pulling what seemed to be either a large container or a small nuclear bomb on wheels through a railway station. I asked. \"What have you got in there? Your money or your wife?\" \"Neither,\" he replied, with the satisfied look of a man who knew he was keeping pace with the latest technology, no matter how ridiculous he looked. \"This is what everyone will have soon--even you. It's called a mobile telephone.\"\nI don't feel sorry for the pace of change. On the contrary, I'm amazed by those high-tech designers who can somehow fit a camera, music-player, computer and phone into a plastic box no bigger than a packet of cigarette. If those geniuses could also find a way to keep the underground trains running on the first snowy day of winter, they would be making real progress for human beings. What I do regret, however, is that so many household items fall behind so soon. My parents bought a wooden wireless radio in 1947, the year they were married. In 1973, the year I went to university, it was still working. It sat in the kitchen like an old friend--which, in a way, it was. It certainly spoke to us more than we spoke to each other on some mornings. When my mum replaced it with a new-style radio that could also play cassette-tapes, I felt a real sense of loss.\nSuch is the over-excited change of 21st-century technology that there's no time to satisfy our emotional needs. Even if Apple's new products turn out to be the most significant tablets I very much doubt if they will resist this trend."

      "Money has always complicated our social lives. A question in October from a woman wondering whether she should attend her neighbors' holiday parties broke my heart: \"I am not able to do the same in return, and I just feel like a freeloader to do so,\" she wrote. \"I'm not even in a position this year to take an appropriate thankyou gift with me.\" I told her to go, of course.\nMeanwhile, hosts worried about the costs of entertaining -- the hosts who write to me, anyway. On the other hand, the hosts that guests write to me about have taken some extreme measures to reduce the cost of their hospitality. These range from a dinner party where a relative of the host explained how expensive the steaks were and \"rather pointedly suggested\" that the letter writer \"make a financial contribution\" to the cost of dinner, to some Cape Cod homeowners who invited a couple to spend a weekend with them -- as long as they brought their own food, bottled water, and toilet paper.\nWeddings and other special events always create extra sources of stress, worsened by the fact that people rarely want to talk honestly about their money situations. One couple chose to have only a civil wedding ceremony for financial reasons and wondered how to tell people this without going into too much detail. A sixtysomething couple needed to cut back on Christmas gifts to their children but weren't sure how to tell them about it. People who had been laid off wondered how to notify friends, respond to inquiries about their job search, and compete with former colleagues for positions.\nIf you are searching for the answers to them, write to me--an advice columnist."

      "Attempt a guess at the following question: In the English-speaking world, which country has the least affordable homes? You are wrong if you guessed the US, even with the housing bubble   and main sadness. Nor is it the UK, where prices have risen because demand is far from supply. According to a recent survey of 227 cities around the globe, you must go south of the equator   to Australia to find the priciest homes.\nThe report measured a city's housing market along the following guidelines. An \"affordable\" home required three times or less of the average family's income to purchase. At four times earnings, a home fell into the \"unaffordable\" category. And a \"seriously unaffordable\" home needed five times a family's income. In Australia, homes in the least affordable city cost just about 9.5 times the average income. Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne were only a little under this figure.\nAustralian officials offered little comment, apart from a general statement on the _ findings. These prices make the possibility that many Australians will one day own a home largely unbelievable. Land rationing   and excessive development charges have raised prices, and the problem will only be solved through urgent action by the Rudd government.\nSome American cities were also included on the least affordable list, four of which were in California. America is still involved in a mortgage crisis, though, affecting the affordability of homes. Yet a number of US cities garnered \"affordable\" status, namely Dallas and Kansas. Australia had no cities listed in the top fifty places with affordable homes.\nThe survey suggests that you can find affordable homes in most places, just not if you're Australian and choose to live down under."

We would, however, remind you of the terms of the policy that this claim should have been submitted within three days after the accident. More than two weeks have now passed. Consequently, your claim to compensation under the policy has been forfeited (, ).\nNevertheless, as an exceptional measure, we have decided to overlook its late submission, though we are bound to say that it should have been clear from Mr. Li's absence from work that this accident was more serious than you had supposed and that there seems to be no good reason why this claim should not have been made earlier.\nWe are enclosing   a claim form as requested, but must emphasize that future claims cannot be entertained if you cannot comply with the terms of the policy.\n                                                                                 Yours faithfully,\n                                                                            (Signature)"

      "What will man be like in the future - in 5000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time.\nLet us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a  ly short period of time, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modem world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity. As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and eventually we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger.\nNowadays our eyes are in constant use.  In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.\nOn the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modem life.\nBut what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald.\nPerhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a human being with thoughts and emotions similar to our own."

      "Today, we are told, children don't spend enough time in the fresh air. Many of them are addicted to a screen either on a computer or a TV -- they seem to be living in a virtual world. They have lost touch with nature.\nBut now 400 organizations in the UK, from playgroups to the National Health Service, are encouraging children to have some \"wild time\". They want kids to swap at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. Activities such as building dens, climbing trees and playing hide and seek are just some of the things kids can do. Even if they live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park.\nChildren often need a helping hand from mum and dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go. Andy Simpson from National Health Service says, \"We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go\".\nSo despite the complicated world that young people grow up in now, it seems that going back to basics and experiencing \"nature's playground\" is what modern children need. David Bond from Project Wild Thing says, \"We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted\".\nThis might sound a bit old fashioned to you, or maybe, like me, it made you think about sticking on your boots, getting outdoors and reliving your childhood.

      "I studied engineering after enjoying top marks, as high school came relatively easy. Then university life came!\nI thought that I must have some learning disorder, as it seemed that everyone else was absorbing the material and making progress while to me it was an insurmountable  struggle. There were never enough hours in the day and weekend to attend the lectures, study the lessons and then do the assignment.\nDuring my darkest hour I called home to speak to my father: \"Dad, I don't think I can handle this.\" My father then said something, which cut through me like a knife: \"There is no returning home. If you quit, then you are on your own.\"\nI hung up thinking what a terrible heartless thing to say. Then, I determined to somehow gut it out . There seemed to be no other choices available! Soon afterwards, I noticed a sigh posted in a campus common area stating: \"Studying Skills\" with a place & time to meet. It said that \"there is help available\". I attended that meeting! I soon discovered there were several others in a similar situation and that everyone wanted to help each other get through this challenging first term. I soon found a study partner, who helped me a lot, and I was grateful to him for his kind help.\nYes, it was still a very challenging first year, but I found the needed strength and support to get through it. In fact my father has been helping me since then, but he has done it in another way. I know now in my heart that he did the very best help he could to help me fly. Thanks Dad for the push!"

      "An earthquake is one of the most common natural disasters. It may cause great damage. So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself. Do not move about or kick up dust."

      "The Japanese have always loved fresh fish. But the waters close to Japan have not held many fish for decades. So fishing boats went farther than ever.but If the return trip took more than a few days, the fish were not fresh. The Japanese did not like the taste.\nThen fishing companies equipped their boats with freezers. They would freeze them at sea. Freezers allowed the boats to go farther and stay longer. However, the Japanese could taste the difference between fresh and frozen and they did not like frozen fish.\nSo fishing boats were equipped with fish tanks. They would  stuff  fish in the tanks ,fin( )to fin .After a little thrashing  around, the fish stopped moving. They were tired and dull, but alive. Unfortunately, the Japanese could still taste the difference. The Japanese preferred the lively taste of fresh fish, not _ fish.\nTo keep the fish tasting fresh, the Japanese fishing companies still put the fish in the tanks. But now they add a small shark to each tank. The shark eats a few fish, but most of the fish arrive in a very lively state. The fish are challenged.\nHave you realized that some of us are also living in a tank but most of the time tired & dull, so we need a Shark in our life to keep us awake and moving.  If your challenges are the correct size, and if you are regularly defeating those challenges, you are Conqueror. You think of your challenges and get energized. You are excited to try new solutions. You are alive! Here is some advice for you :\n1. Instead of avoiding challenges, jump into them and enjoy the game. If your challenges are   too large or too numerous, do not give up. Instead, reorganize. Find more determination, more knowledge, more help.\n2. God didn't promise days without pain, laughter  without sorrow, sun without rain, but he did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears and light for the way.\n3. Disappointments are like road blocks, they slow you down a bit but you enjoy the smooth road afterwards. Don't stay on the bumps too long. Move on!"

My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.\nIn my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .\nMy mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: \"You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams.\"\nMy mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.\nHow I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!"

      "Traffic jams seem a sure companion of national holidays. On May 1, there were constant traffic jams on highways leading out of the several metropolises, the longest, according to reports, was 55 kilometers. Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays. The measures might not prevent traffic jams, but they may at least ease the jams."

      "What did your school smell like? Was it noisy or peaceful? It might not seem important, but a growing body of research suggests that smells and sounds can have an impact on learning, performance and creativity.\nBridget Shield has been conducting studies and advising people on the effects of all sorts of noises, such as traffic and sirens, as well as noise made by the children themselves. \"Everything points to a harmful impact of the noise on children's performance, in numeracy, in literacy, and in spelling,\" says Shield.\nShield says the sound of \"babble\" -the chatter of other children, is particularly distracting in the classroom.. People are very distracted by speech-particularly if it is understandable, but you're not involved in it.\" This phenomenon is also known as the irrelevant speech effect, she says, adding that \"it's a very common finding in open-plan offices as well.''\nIn a series of studies published last year, Ravi Mehta found that people were more creative when the background noises were played at a medium level than when volume was low. Loud background noise, however, damaged their creativity. Ravi Mehta suggests there maybe some benefit to playing music or other sounds in an art class or other situations where creativity is the key.\nMany teachers all over the world already play music to students in class. Many are inspired by the belief that hearing music can boost IQ in their tasks, the so-called Mozart effect. While the evidence actually suggests it's a guess to say classical music boosts brainpower, researchers do think pleasant sounds before a task can sometimes lift your mood and help you perform well, says Ravi Mehta,\" If you like the music or you like the sound-even listening to a Stephen King novel-then you did better. It didn't matter about the music,\" he says.\nHowever, it's worth considering that music is not always helpful while you're trying to work. Trying to perform a task which involves serial recall - for instance, doing mental mathematics-will be distracted by sounds with audio variation, says Ravi Mehta. Songs with lyrics, on the other hand, are more likely to interfere with tasks that involve languages-such as reading comprehension.\nThis isn't the only sense being related to affecting learning."

      "Plastic is one of the most important technological discoveries of the 20th century. However, it may soon be replaced. The new development- liquid wood- can replace plastics in all branches of modern-day industries.\nPlastic as a material enjoys the biggest demand in the modern world, but it does have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, plastic isn't recyclable. Secondly, it contains toxins   helping develop cancerous diseases. Finally, it's made of oil and oil reserves aren't endless.\nThe liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead. Norbert Eisenfreich, a senior researcher at the Faunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology in Germany (ICT), said that arboform, the new material, is made of lignin , which can be obtained from soft tissues of wood. Once mixed with several other matenals, it turns into solid and non-toxic _ for plastics.\nICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone-Kauffmann said the wood-working industry separates wood into three basic components, including lignin. Lignin isn't used for the production of paper. Specialists of ICT mixed lignin with several natural materials and thus invented the material which could be melted and molded  .\nWhen solid, arboform looks like plastic and possesses tho qualitie of polished wood. It can be used for the production of any items. Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength. In addition, liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly. The material preserved all of its qualities even if it's reprocessed ten times.\nHowever, the new invention doesn't enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur  in it. German researchers are sure to reduce the amount of sulfur by 90% very soon to make arboform usable for home needs."

      "Scientists are developing a new kind of machine to take the place of humans. These machines can do jobs in places that are too dangerous for humans. For example, they are being developed to work in nuclear power center, deep under the oceans and in outer space.\nJohn Marrit, a psychologist  in Williamsburg Massachusetts, helped develop the new machine. This is how they work. A machine is placed in an area far away from the person who operates it. The person wears special hard hat with television screens and sound equipment. The screens and sound equipment let the person see and hear exactly what the machine is seeing and hearing. Mr. Marrit says this gives the person the feeling of being in the same place as the machine. The idea, he says, is being there without going there. The person uses an electronic control to make the machine move. The machine copies the person's movements exactly. If the person raises his right arm, the machine raises the right arm, too. This means an expert can do a dangerous job while staying in the safe place. For example, a person can direct the machine to destroy a bomb without going near the bomb himself."

When you receive infonnation about how you have performed  in a test or set of tasks t you may worry about how you are judged. Our parents probably said to us when we were young,\"Since you scored really well in the test, you must  be clever.\" However, by being repeatedly told \"You arc clever\" or \"You are really ga*al al your job\",a person's self-respect is actually dainagcd.\nThe  growlh - mindest  persona view life as a series of exciting challenges and  want  t o constantly  learn. Brain activity occurs in this mindset when they receive information about what they could do belter or improve. They do not view their abilities as fixed or us failure. Learning is king and the more they practice , the more they know they will succeed.\nWhat is important is giving praise around process and not around ability. For example , instead of saying\"Since you got a great score, you must be clever\" f say \" You got a great score, and you must have tried really hard\". This creates challenge in indivicluats and [:Z&xx&k.Com]\nThe meaning of mindsets is massive for business. Fixed-mindset managers are not fans of giving feedback  . They do not want to stretch themselves or others because they fear failure. Therefore their business may stand still because there is no risk or innovation   occurring.\nListen from your own fixed mindset  for example ,\" I can't  do that\"  and answer with a growth-mindset response  \"I can't do that yet!\" Remember  there is no such thing as failure and there is s only learning.

      "One day, when my wife and I were leaving a restaurant, I heard a man's voice from a car in the car-park. After a quick look at the car, I noticed the Pennsylvania license plate   at once, so I knew they had come from far away. The young man had his head partly out of the window and spoke to me as I moved closer, \"Excuse me, my wife and I are trying to find a room for the night and every place in the area seems to be filled up. Do you have any suggestions for us where we might find a room?\"\nWell, that didn't surprise me. After all, it was the busy time of the year for tourism. As he spoke, I noticed that his wife was pregnant  . I told them that they should just keep searching and wished them good luck in their search. The young husband didn't say any other words and backed out of the car-park and headed off. We also got into our car and drove home.\nAfter a short drive, I couldn't get this young couple out of my mind. Here they were, traveling in a different state, tired, the wife pregnant. It was at that moment that my wife told me we needed to go back and find that couple. We went back and looked for them. We even went as far as the mountain. I'm happy that this story had a happy ending. We found them in the end, gave them a room, and now we are close friends."

      "Scientists today are making greater effort to study ocean currents   . Most do it using satellites and other high-tech equipment. However, ocean expert Curtis Ebbesmeyer does it in a special way -- by studying movements of random floating garbage. A scientist with many years' experience, he started this type of research in the early 1990s when he heard about hundreds of athletic shoes washing up on the shores of the northwest coast of the United States. There were so many shoes that people were setting up _ to try and match left and right shoes to sell or wear.\nEbbesmeyer found out in his researches that the shoes -- about 60,000 in total -- fell into the ocean in a shipping accident. He phoned the shoe company and asked if they wanted the shoes back. As expected, the company told him that they didn't. Ebbesmeyer realized this could be a great experiment. If he learned when and where the shoes went into the water and tracked where they landed, he could learn a lot about the patterns of ocean currents.\nThe Pacific Northwest is one of the world's best areas for beachcombing  because winds and currents join here, and as a result, there is a group of serious beachcombers in the area. Ebbesmeyer got to know a lot of them and asked for their help in collecting information about where the shoes landed. In a year he collected reliable information on 1, 600 shoes. With this data, he and a colleague were able to test and improve a computer program designed to model ocean currents, and publish the findings of their study.\nAs the result of his work, Ebbesmeyer has become known as the scientist to call with questions about any unusual objects found floating in the ocean. He has even started an association of beachcombers and ocean experts, with 500 subscribers from West Africa to New Zealand. They have recorded all lost objects ranging from potatoes to golf gloves."

      "Should we allow modern buildings to- be built next to older buildings in a historic area of  a city? In order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. Not all historical buildings are attractive. However, there may be other reasons for example, economic   reasons-why they should be preserved. So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?\nIn my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate   its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.\nIt is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt   the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. Yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. I think this is simply because people are naturally conservative and do not like change.\nAlthough we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, I believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to _ . If we always reproduced what was there before,we would all still be living in caves . Thus , I would argue against copying previous architectural styles and choose something fresh and different , even though that might be the more risky choice."

      "Many of us don't like what we see around us but the last thing we do is to change it. I think that is the beginning of failure and that is why what we hate remains around us. If you don't want to see things around you, don't just hope it'll change.\nWe have such an amazing power of creativity inside us to change the way things work around us. Only lazy people go about and say that is the way things have been working. I've come to discover that things around us depend on our actions and inactions. What I mean is that the circumstances that we like depend only on the things we do and the things we don't do.\nDo you want your country to change? Start by changing the small things around you. Before you think too far about any small thing to change, your habit should be the first thing to change. Change what you think about and talk about. Can you remember how difficult it was for you to break a habit that you desired to break some years back? If so, then you must accept that things aren't just going to change by a magic thought. If it isn't so easy to change yourself when you want to, it isn't going to be so easy to change the people around you.\nI think the best way I've changed people around me is that I changed myself. When you change, they'll change. Just change yourself and see how many people will tell you later that you are the one who changes them. That's one simple way young people can change their nations."

      "The Last Supper is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces in the whole field of pictorial art. Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting, the monks in the church annoyed at the delay. It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.\nThis inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor . But he would look no further; if none came his way, he would be satisfied to take Prior as a model for Judas. This threat silenced the angry Prior, who quite naturally had no desire to pass to descendants in such a fashion."

      "In 1752, three years after two Scotsmen, Alexander Wilson and Thomas Melville, fastened thermometers to kites to record the temperature of clouds, Benjamin Franklin made his famous experiment with a kite, a string, and a key. Franklin hoped to show that nature's tremendous displays of electricity in lightning were the same thing as the feeble electric sparks scientists of the day were producing in their laboratories. He built a square kite to which he attached an iron wire. He flew the kite with a hemp string , and near the base of the string he tied a large brass key. The kite rose into a dark thundercloud, where the iron wire picked up electrical charges. Franklin noticed that the strands of the string  were beginning to stand up with electricity. As rain wet the string, it conducted more electricity. Standing in the shelter of a shed, Franklin cautiously reached out his finger to touch the brass key. A series of sparks jumped from the key to his finger. He thus proved that lightning and electricity are the same. We now know that this experiment was a dangerous one, for Franklin might have been killed by a bolt of lighting."

      "Fear and its companion pain are two of the most useful things that men and animals possess, if they are properly used. If fire did not hurt when it burnt, children would play with it until their hands were burnt away. Similarly, if pain existed but fear didn't, a child would burn himself or herself again and again, because fear would not warn himself or herself to keep away from the fire that had burnt himself or herself before. A really fearless soldier--and some do exist, is not a good soldier because he is soon killed; and a dead soldier is of no use to his army. Fear and pain are therefore two guards without which men and animals might soon die out.\nIn our first sentence we suggested that fear should be properly used. If, for example, you never go out of your house because of the danger of being knocked down and killed in the street by a car, you are letting fear rule you too much. Even in your house you are not absolutely safe: an aeroplane may crash on your house, or ants may eat away some of the beams in your roof so that the latter falls on you, or you may get cancer!\nThe important thing is not to let fear rule you, but instead to use fear as your servant and guide. Fear will warn you of dangers; then you have to decide what action to take.\nIn many cases, you can take quick and successful action to avoid the danger. For example, you see a car coming straight towards you. Fear warns you, you jump out of the way, and all is well.\nIn some cases, however, you decide that there is nothing that you can do to avoid the danger. For example, you can't prevent an aeroplane crashing onto your house. In this case, fear has given you its warning; you have examined it and decided on your course of action, so fear of this particular danger is no longer of any use to you, and you have to try to overcome it."

      "For a long time, a boy wondered why his next-desk-pal was always the first in the class, whereas he could only rank the 21st. At home, he asked his mom, \"Am I more stupid than other kids? How come I always lag behind? I just can't come up with an answer.\" Mom was aware that her son's self-respect had been damaged by the ranking system, but she didn't know what to say to help.\nShe was tempted   to say that intelligence differs and that yes, her son's friend really was the smarter boy. But that would have so upset her son. Thank goodness she resisted the temptation to say it.\nHer son and his friend went on to high school that year, but despite trying as hard as he could, her son's friend still outdid him. But she was proud of her boy for his hard work, sincerely proud. It was around this time she decided to take him on a trip to the seaside. On the trip, she at last found an answer for him.\nToday her son no longer cares about rankings. He doesn't have to, for he himself is now the top of the class - at the top national university he attends. Invited to speak to his old high school, he mentioned a valuable childhood experience: \"Once, on a trip to the sea, my mother and I were lying on the beach. She pointed to the sea and said to me: 'Do you see the seabirds fighting for food out there? When a wave comes near, the little birds rise quickly. The \"clumsy\" seagulls   are far less agile   and have to struggle to get away from the wave. But these \"clumsy\" birds prove to have the biggest, strongest wings, which open the widest and allow the bird to travel the furthest. When the season changes, they leave for foreign shores, leaving the little birds behind. Son, I have a feeling that you are one of those seagulls.\""

      "Face-book chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Anna Maria Chavez, chief of American Girl Scouts, are leading a campaign to discourage the use of the word \"bossy\". Does the term destroy the confidence of young girls?\nThe campaign claims that terms like \"bossy\" are improperly applied to females, preventing schoolgirls from seeing themselves as future \"leaders\". From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\". As late as 2008, the word appeared in reference to females four times more often than males, claim the Ban Bossy campaigners. \"To me, the reference is always is association with women,\" says Helen Trim, director of Fresh Minds. \"I have three brothers and my family still call me 'bossy' today.\" Her father is the only other family member who could be considered in that way, says Trim, but nobody would ever call him so.\nSome educators recommend that the word should be reclaimed, rather than banned.\"But the thing with'bossy' is that there's an infantile  element to it,\"says Sara Mills, professor at Sheffield University. \"You think of 'bossy' as being like a little kid who's claiming more than he has the right to claim.\"\nIt's not just\"bossy\"under fire.\"Pushy\"is another target. The implication is that women shouldn't present themselves as powerful and confident. Mills suggests, which some women are willing to listen to and accept. Trim points out that many modern female business role models are able to be bosses without being labeled'bossy'.And she rarely,if ever, hears the word used within her company. But she says that the damage may be dome much earlier in a woman's life.\"It does come about from those early teenage years.\"she says.\"I think it's impossible to ban a word, but if people are replacing it with words like'confidence'or'assertiveness',we would all be in a much better place.\""

      "People have been talking about health for a long time because people know the importance of it. People's understanding of health also becomes deeper with the progress in scientific research. Recently the term \"health\" has come to have a wider meaning than it used to. It no longer means just the absence of illness. Today, health means the well-being of your body, your mind and your relationship with other people. This new concept of health is closely related to another term-quality of life. Quality of life is the degree of overall satisfaction that a person gets from life.\nWhy has the emphasis of health shifted from the absence of disease to a broader focus on the quality of a person's life? One reason for this has to do with the length and conditions of life that people can now expect. Medical advances have made it possible for people today to live longer, healthier lives. Imagine for a moment that you were born in the year 1900. You could have expected on average to live until about the age of 47. In contrast, if you were born in the year 1999, you could expect to live to the age of 75."

      "If we want to deal with the association  between boys and girls properly, here are some \"dos and don'ts\" for you to follow.\nKeep a normal and healthy state of mind. Our schools and classes are made up of boys and girls. It is very natural for the boys and girls to make friends with each other. We should make as many friends as possible. We should keep in touch with the other sex  in public instead of in secret.\nDon't be too nervous or too shy. If you are a shy person, you can also find a way out. First of all, you can make friends with the students who have the same interest and hobby as you. As both of you have much in common, you may have much to talk about. If you keep doing like that, little by little, you will gladly find you are also as free to express yourself as others.\nDon't fall into the _ of early love. The boys and girls at adolescence  are rich in feeling. They are easy to regard the friendship as a sign of love and fall in love with each other at an early age. In my opinion, early love is a green apple that can't be eaten. An apple won't taste sweet until it is fully ripe. Boys and girls at middle school are too young to carry the heavy duty of love.

      "Rats that eat high levels of a natural sugar, known as fructose, seem to age faster than other rats, and the same could be true for people who eat too much sweet junk food, Israeli researchers said Monday.\nFructose, found naturally in honey and fruit, is used widely in foods ranging from soft drinks to yogurt.But while its sweet taste is popular, the sugar could cause wrinkles and do harm to health, the researchers said.\nDr.Moshe Werman and Boaz Levi fed large amounts of fructose to laboratory rats.They said the fructose-fed rats showed changes in the collagen   of their skin and bones.\nCollagen, a fibrous protein found in connective tissue, bone and cartilage, basically holds the body together.The loss of collagen is what causes loose and deep wrinkles in older people.\nThe process affected, Werman's team said, is known as \"cross linking\".\"Too much cross-linking reduces elasticity   and makes the skin stiff   , and these are the conditions that encourage wrinkled skin,\" Werman said in a statement.He said the same could be true of people, although this has not been shown.\"Americans are eating more and more processed foods such as carbonated drinks, baked foods, canned fruits, jams and dairy products that contain fructose,\" Werman said.\nOther studies have shown that high fructose intake can affect how the body handles glucose and increases insulin   resistance--which can both be important measures of the tendency toward diabetes.\nThe rats Werman worked with were fed much more than the average adult person might eat in a day, which is standard in such experiments.The rats were fed on 12.5 grams fructose per kg (2.2 pounds) of weight every day for a year.To compare, a person weighing 154 pounds (70kg) who drinks a liter of cola consumes about 60 grams of fructose, or 0.8 grams per kg of body weight."

As soon as he could sit up, he worked on his stamp collection, began to write a history of the United States and a book about John Paul Jones--a navy hero. He was also ready to try anything that might help him to get well. A member of his family tells the following: Roosevelt got a great deal of physical exercise later simply by crawling around on the floor. Although now over forty, he spent hours crawling around his library floor like a child. Then he decided to learn how to go up the stairs by himself.

Capital of Peace is one of its names-- the European headquarters of the United Nations lies here in Palais des Nations. Another worthy name for this city with a humanitarian tradition and international character is the World's Smallest Metropolis. Parks,splendid stores and lively streets in the old part of town and its 2000 -- year history wait to be discovered.\nThe Jet d'Eau together with the Flower Watch are the main attractions every year for the tourists visiting Geneva. The Jet d'Eau has become the symbol of Geneva for a long time. This is a 140 meters high water monument with a rich history. Eight 13,500--watt projectors light the grand column of the fountain in the evening, from early March until the second Sunday of October. The Flower Watch, which was created at the edge of the English Garden in 1955,reminds us about that Geneva is the birthplace of the Swiss clock and watch making, and that this industry has become internationally famous, as well through the quality of the watches as through their beautiful appearance.\nSails on Lake Geneva are also enjoyable. The Lake of Geneva, lying among the Alps, is a true inland sea, making possible a wide range of pleasant boat trips, you can relax and watch the beautiful scenes pass by."

      "Our love of music and appreciation of musical harmony is learnt and not based on natural ability, a new study by University of Melbourne researchers has found. The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony.\nThe study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules.\nThe researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations of notes  to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they found the notes unfamiliar they also found the sound unpleasant. This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive.\nThe study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing  the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock.\nDepending on their training, a strange chord  sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt.\nTo confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly, afterward they reported that the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant -- regardless of how the chords were played.\nThe question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. \"We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder \", a researcher said."

      "The London Eye 4D Film Experience started in August and is included in the London Eye ticket price. It is a fantastic 4D film to entertain you before your trip on the London Eye. The 4D effects are great.\nNo Extra Cost to You\nThat's right; you buy your ticket for the London Eye and 4D cinema experience. Merlin Entertainments, the London Eye owners, spent 5 million creating the film and building the 4D cinema and wanted to improve the value for money of the London Eye.\nWhat to Expect\nThe 4D Cinema entrance is in the ticket hall. So after buying your ticket, go straight to it, where you'll be given a pair of glasses. About 160 visitors will pass through the 4D cinema every 8 minutes so don't worry about waiting time. People in the bright pink cinema are all standing on four levels. The top level is designed for wheelchairs.\nLondon Eye 4D Film\nPut on your glasses and enjoy yourself. The story is about a little girl visiting London with her father and she wants to be higher to get a better view so she comes to the London Eye. It differs from watching the 3D film for all your senses are involved. When it snows on screen, you feel it snows in the cinema. And when you watch the fireworks, you can really smell them.\nFor a short film, less than four minutes, before the main attraction you think you've come for, you are going to love this free extra. I stood there with my mouth wide open at the end as many others did. It's fantastic! The effects are the Hollywood standard as no expense is spared. I was lucky enough to try the film three times on the first day and I still want to go back again."

      "Coffee grows only in the tropics . The temperature must be between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Coffee must have shade from nearby trees, but it also requires at least two hours of sunlight each day.\nIt was in the 18thand 19thcenturies that coffee seeds from the Middle East were taken to Latin America, the Carribean, and Africa. It spread fast, with demand for the coffee growing in the northern part of the world. Millions of acres of rainforest and jungle were planted with coffee trees. Because of coffee's need for shade and its ability to be grown alongside other crops, the small coffee trees didn't require any forests to be cleared.\nBut this took a bad turn in 1970 when US agricultural scientists decided to develop a new coffee plant that grew only in the full sun. Farmer agreed to grow this new coffee because they could produce five times more coffee than before. With the support of local governments, it isn't difficult to understand why many traditional coffee fields quickly became modern ones. As a result, over the past 40 years, Central America has lost two-thirds of its rainforests at a rate of 40 million acres per year. That figure is similar to Mexico.\nThese modern coffee plantations  are very harmful as nothing can grow in the fields besides the coffee bushes. As the rainforests disappear, so do the animals. Sun plantations also contribute to soil erosion . The coffee trees must face not only the heat with no protection, they must also face heavy rains, which slowly washes much of the soil away. Sun coffee field are actually risky for farmers in the long term."

      "Kids undergo a large amount of pressure and stress during their school exams, which can often become quite overwhelming (to much) for them. It may be the first experience of stress, at this level, they have ever experienced and therefore quite frightening. Yes, you may say that it's all a part of growing up and therefore good lessons for them to learn, and to an extent I agree with you. However, it's important to learn how to prepare for life's challenges so that they aren't overwhelming or scary and so that we are able to manage them the best we can.\nHere are some tips you can use during your kids exam time.\nBreak their revision plan down into small parts. Doing this will help transform what once seemed like a huge impossible task into a more manageable one.\nHelp them arrange properly so that the subjects they like the least (perhaps ones that require more time and effort) are worked on first; once they are out of the way, it will help reduce the worry.\nPlan week on week to make sure they are on track. Ticking items of a list each week will help them to feel good about themselves and their progress.\nCreate rewards for all the ticks - a favourite TV programme, a delicious snack, an hour's surfing the Internet, computer games or whatever it was that they enjoy the most. This will encourage them to carry on and make them feel good.\nThink of strategies on how to deal with exams calmly so their anxieties don't _ et the better _ them.\nTalk about times in their lives when they had been successful at something and look at the qualities they used to get them there - determination, persistence, hard work, patience, positivity, dedication - discuss how they can apply these skills to their exams.\nAcknowledge that if they do their best that is good enough.\nEnsure they realize that this period in their lives will pass and that exams are only a temporary time in their lives; nothing can and does last forever.\nEnsure they keep their eye on the prize: enjoying their long summer holiday when the exams are finished; giving them something to look forward to will help to motivate them and provide a positive end in sight."

      "There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care. To water his flowers, he used two buckets. One was a shiny and new bucket. The other was a very old and _ one, which had seen many years of service, but was now past its best.\nEvery morning, the gardener would fill up the two buckets. Then he would carry them along the path, one on each side, to the flowerbeds. The new bucket was very proud of itself. It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled  . The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes: before it reached the flowerbeds, much water had leaked  along the path.\nSometimes the new bucket would say, \"See how great I am! How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day! I don't know why he still bothers with you. What a waste of space you are!\"\nAnd all that the old bucket could say was. \"I know I am not very useful, but I can only do my best. I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me, at least.\"\nOne day, the gardener heard that kind of conversation. After watering the flowers as usual, he said, \"You both have done your work very well. Now I am going to carry you back. I want you to look carefully along the path.\"\nThen the two buckets did so. All along the path, they noticed, on the side where the new bucket was carried, there was just bare earth; on the other side where the old bucket was carried, there was a joyous row of wild flowers, leading all the way to the garden."

      "It was in 1865 that two Frenchmen were looking into the future. Edouard de Laboulaye, who studied history, admired the United States greatly. Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was a famous artist. De Laboulaye was thinking about 1876, when the country he respected so much would celebrate its 100th birthday. What gift would be good enough for the people of France to give? Right away, Bartholdi thought of a giant statue.\nBartholdi kept thinking about a statue for several years. Then, in 1871, he visited the United States and saw the perfect place for a huge statue. It was Bedloe's Island in New York.\nThe project -- the Statue of Liberty -- got started almost immediately, and Bartholdi went home to France to begin work. However, the statue was not finished in time for the 100th birthday. The United States Congress approved   the use of Bedloe's Island on February 22, 1877. During the 100th celebration in 1876, the arm of the statue that would hold the torch was shown in Philadelphia. In 1879 the huge head was put on display in France. For the face of the statue, Bartholdi used his mother as a model.\nThe statue was finally completed in 1884. The work had been difficult enough, but then some really hard work began. The statue had to be taken apart and packed into boxes. It was not until May 1885 that the statue -- in pieces -- left France for its new home.\nThe statue arrived in June. However, the Americans fell behind on their part of the project. They hadn't raised enough money for building the base of the statue. People wondered if the country really needed or wanted such a gift. Finally, though, the money was raised and the base was completed. The last piece of the statue was put in place on October 28, 1886."

      "Do you blank out, freeze up or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety.\nBut, don't panic. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it.\nBelieve it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite  before tests, and poor performances. Some people might feel shaky, hot, or even sick.\nIf you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety.\nWhen you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you are doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to \"STOP\". This will get your mind off the stress.\nThen think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence.\nTalk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example:\" I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can.\"\nAnother thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities.\nLast but not least, start test preparation early---three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills ---for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that your are in control."

      "Daily life can be made happier. It is a matter of choice. It is our attitude that makes us feel happy or unhappy. It is true, we meet all kinds of situations during the day, and some of them may not be conductive to happiness. We can choose to refuse to think about the unhappy events. If we let outer events influence our moods, we become their slaves. On the other hand, we can free ourselves from outer influences. We can choose to be happy, and we can do a lot to add happiness to our lives.\nWhat is happiness? It is a feeling of inner peace and satisfaction. It is usually experienced when there are no worries, fears or confused thoughts, and this usually happens when we do something we love to do or when we win, gain or achieve something that we value. It seems to be the outcome of positive events, but it actually comes from the inside, triggered by outer events.\nFor most people happiness seems passing quickly. One of the best ways to keep it, is by gaining inner peace through daily meditation . As the mind becomes more peaceful, it becomes easier to choose the happiness habit.\nHere are a few tips for increasing happiness in daily life:\nTry hard to change the way you look at things. Always look at the bright side.\nThink of solutions, not problems.\nListen to relaxing, uplifting music.\nWatch funny comedies that make you laugh.\nEach day, devote some time to reading a few pages of an inspiring book or article.\nWhenever you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts, start thinking of pleasant things."

      "Knowing about yourself means not only that you find out what you're good at and what you like, it also means discovering what you're not good at and what you don't like. Both help you to see your aim  in life.\nAlthough most students would be unhappy if they found that they had failed a very difficult physics examination, they have in fact learned a lot about themselves. They know that they should not become engineers or physical scientists. So failing can help a student to live a much happier life if he or she draws something out of the failing. They may then decide on their aims and choose the kind of work they would be fit for and they would like to do.\nIt is impossible to decide whether or not you like something until you have tried it. If you decide that you would like to play the piano, you need to take more than one lesson before you can know whether you are really interested in it or you are able to do well. It is not enough to want to be\na great pianist. You also have to like the hard practice and long training before you become one. If you would enjoy being a great pianist but hate the work, forget it.\nIt's a good plan to try as many ideas as possible when you are still young. And then you will be able to find out what your true interests are."

      "Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge? A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is \"yes\".\nIn The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker presents data showing that human violence, while still very much with us today, has been gradually declining. Moreover, he says, \"over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a peaceful force. Traditional war is a man's game: tribal women never band together to attack neighboring villages.\" As mothers, women tend to maintain peaceful conditions in which to bring up their children.\nSkeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power. If they were empowered as leaders, the disorder of the world would force them to make the same warlike decisions that men do. Margaret Thatcher,Golda Meir, and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war.\nBut it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of \"a man's world.\" It was their success consistent with male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place. In a world in which women were in the majority of leadership positions, they might behave differently in power.\nSo we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership? In terms of traditional opinion, various psychological studies show that men tend towards the hard power of command, while women are cooperative and naturally understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion.\nThe key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard and soft power skills to produce smart policies. Both men and women will make those decisions."

      "Many of us are interested in time travel and shuttling back and forth   to the past or the future. Who wouldn't be _ by returning to the past or seeing the future? But time travel seems to be possible only in our imagination or in science fiction  .\nScience fiction is a world where impossible things can become possible and that's why most of us like it. But science fiction is not entirely fiction since it is based on science theories  . Time travel, for instance, is a theme used by sci-fi writers. Readers may sometimes think writers have first-hand experience of it. I have collected some of the popular ways in which time travel is made possible in science fiction:\n* Through the wormhole -- A wormhole is a path between points in space-time. According to Einstein, an object can pass through a wormhole if it can travel at the speed of light. An example of a wormhole is described in Riddle of the Red Bible.\n* Through a black hole -- A black hole is a vacuum   in space where light cannot even escape or pass through. In some sci-fi movies, like Star Trek, black holes became the means to travel through time.\n* Through time machines -- In science fiction, time machines are vehicles that can travel faster than light. It can be a strange vehicle like the TARDIS in Doctor Who or a special car like the one used in Back to the Future. But these special vehicles would need a wormhole to travel to the past or the future.\n* Through parallel universe   -- Another popular way to travel through time is to be able to get into a parallel universe where one can go back to a point in time and see a different reality.\nThough we know time travel may not be possible, it is still an entertaining subject and a heated topic for most of us. And in science fiction, where reality is always in the imagination, time does not really matter."

      "Valentine's Day, for many couples, means cards, flowers, and candlelight dinners. For most couples it also means withdrawing money at the ATM to express their love. Fortunately, there are ways to save money by saving energy -- even during the date -- so you can spend the money you save on the things that really matter to your sweetheart. Here are five easy tips for those couples out there who want to save energy and save money:\nA fireplace is always a perfect background to set up holiday decorations because of the space it provides, in addition to the grand role it plays in the house as being an important part of each room. If you plan on spending your Valentine's Day near the fireplace, be sure to prevent the heat loss and make sure of the chimney efficiency. If you never use your fireplace, plug and seal the chimney flue.\nIf you plan on having a nice, romantic dinner at home and want to set the mood with proper lighting, use energy efficient light bulbs that save you money, and look for bulbs that are lower in lumens. Lumens tell you the brightness of the bulb. The lower the lumens, the weaker the light.\nFor those who plan to cook that romantic dinner, there are some simple energy efficient ways you can prepare that meal. For example, did you know that if you're baking in a china or glass dish, you can typically set your oven for 25 degrees less than the recipe calls for? Learn more about saving energy while cooking.\nFor those couples who would like to have a movie night, plug your TV and DVD into an electronic power strip to save money on your gas of the car. By plugging in electronic devices into a power strip and turning it off when not in use, you can save up to $100 per year.\nIf you plan on going on a romantic \"escape\" from your house by car, be sure to check out these tips to reduce fuel consumption and costs."

      "How much and who on your cruise  should be tipped? When and how should tips be given? Generally, you should plan to tip your room steward   $3.00 to $3.50 per person, per day, and plan an equal amount for your dining room waiter, and half of that for the busboy . \nOn most ships, tip the maitre d'  or dining room captain only if you ask for special favors or table-side service; $5 to $10 is normal.

Also, tips for special services such as salon && spa treatments and room service are left to the guest, depending on services offered. Sometimes tips are placed in envelopes from your cabin's stationery supply. Generally, passengers on cruises of 10 days or less will tip at the end of the cruise; on longer voyages, tipping weekly. \nAs part of a new trend that seems likely to grow, Carnival, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess and Cunard now charge tips to your account  . Norwegian, for example, charges $10 per day, per guest, to cover service in the various dining rooms and your room steward. If you feel this amount needs to be increased or decreased, arrangements can be made onboard the ship, generally at the end of your cruise. \nA few lines do not encourage tipping, including Radisson Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea and Windstar. Crew members are reportedly higher paid and not tip dependent. Many passengers tip anyway for outstanding service or special favors and give them tips face to face immediately they get serviced. \nTips on Tipping \nCabin steward \n$3.00 to $3.50 per person per day \nWaiter \n$3.00 to $3.50 per person per day \nAssistant waiter \n$1.50 to $2.00 per person per day \nBartender, wine and deck stewards \n10-15% of the bill \nMaitre d' \n$5.00 to $10.00 tip for each special service"

This relatively small town in Missouri had never seen so much action. She and Susie were standing at the top of the only high rise building in town for Susie loved to try to find their house among the rows and rows of little boxes.\n\"Momma? \" Susie said in a frightened voice, two seconds before a gun shot went off, making her scream at the top of her lungs.

      "Uncle Tom gave little Vicki Black a birthday gift one week before her birthday. He told her not to open it until her birthday. She knew her mother wouldn't tolerate any disrespect to the kind man who helped them out after Vicki's father passed away. Besides, Vicki didn't want to get Uncle Tom angry. But little Vicki didn't want to just hold it and guess what was in it. After all, she looked forward to his coming to show her interesting things, like how to turn an old sock into a doll.\nAll the day, Vicki couldn't stop thinking about the gift. While her teacher was giving a lecture, Vicki sat still in her seat, drawing paper dolls inside the box. When school was done, she raced home. Walking into the room, again, she shook the present, but she heard nothing. Holding her breath, she opened the box and looked inside. Seconds later, she cried. When Mrs Black saw the box, she said angrily, \"Didn't I tell you to leave it alone?\"\nVicki sobbed   and said, \"Mommy, you don't understand.\"\n\"Don't cry to me. You have missed everything now, just because you couldn't wait,\" Mrs Black accused. \"What will Uncle Tom think now?\"\n\"Uncle Tom gave me nothing,\" Vicki cried and handed the empty box to her mother. \"He played a trick on me.\"\nMrs Black said doubtfully, \"Uncle Tom is not like that. You must have dropped it.\"\nVicki kept crying. Only a rapid knock on the door made the house quiet. It was Uncle Tom. He looked at the empty box. \"You have already done it? I told you to wait for your birthday.\"\n\"You didn't give me a gift.\" Fresh tears filled her eyes.\n\"I try to give you something. I know your birthday is a special day. I tell myself to give you something valuable to last your whole life. I think hard and get an idea to give you an important lesson. If you open it on birthday, I see you learn. Then I will make a big party to celebrate, Maybe next year you listen, and then you will understand the gift better.\"\nVicki's cheeks flushed  ."

      "It is never too late to try to make your dreams come true. This could be Mary Moe's motto--the expression that best presents her spirit. Mary Moe has done a lot during the past 91 years. For much of that time, she wanted to fly, but never had the chance--until now. She recently achieved her life-long dream.\nMary just learned how to fly an airplane, a dream she has had since she was a little girl. Growing up, she was inspired by two American pilots: Charles Lindburgh Amelia Earhart. They became her inspiration. Lindbugh made the solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Five years later, Earhart became the first woman to make the flight. But Mary Moe could not find time to make her dream come true. At age 34, she was just too busy--busy fighting cancer. She was also busy with her job in advertising and busy raising her family.\nThere was simply no time to think about flying a plane. And it was difficult for her to drive to the airport. Lessons were costly. Everything seemed to be working against Mary.\n\"I had actually gone out to that airport in the 1980s to see about flying lessons and it was such a long drive out and expensive and I thought, 'No, I have to _ for a while.'\" So her dream had to wait. She kept it on the back burner. Then, at age 91, her wish finally came true.\nMs Moe learned about Wish of a lifetime. Wish of a Lifetime is a non-profit organization whose goal is to change the way our society thinks about aging and older adults.\nSally Webster works for the group. Wish of Lifetime helps older people, senior citizens, enjoy a dream. It also sends the message that it is never too late for a dream. So they really try to look for those stories that are inspiring and can show people that older Americans can achieve things just like younger Americans can."

      "New research has shown that you might not just be feeling blue; you may also be seeing it differently. Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.\nThe team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren't feeling sad.\n\"We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\" Thorstenson said in a statement. \"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way.\"\nThorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.\nThe team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn't do that in a specific order. The entire group was then tasked with identifying the colors in 48 continued color changes. The group that had been shown the sad clip was measurably worse at identifying colors along the blue-yellow axis.\nFor the second study, 130 participants were randomly assigned to watch either a sad clip or a neutral   one. The sadness group showed reduced ability to identify colors along the blue-yellow axis than the neutral group."

      "Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language."

      "Much of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power centers and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to 75% of all surface water supplies.\nSnowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold, winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals. Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is greatly reduced.\nSnow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves. When there is fresh snow on the ground, the surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. However, snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds. Then the snow's surface will help to send back sound waves. Under these conditions, sounds may seem clearer and travel farther.\nGenerally, the color of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. This gives them their color. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected. Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white appearance.\nSometimes, snow or ice may appear to be blue. The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice. In simple terms, think of snow or ice as a filter. A filter is designed to reject some substances, while permitting others to pass through. In the case of snow, all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick. If it is a meter or more thick, however, blue light often can be seen."

      "Do you ever wonder why the English have one word for some animals and a different one for their meat? Why do they use pig and pork, cow and beef, and sheep and mutton? To find it out, we have to go back to 1066, when the Norman French invaded England and put a French king on the English throne  , which not only changed the government but also changed the language. French became the language of the upper classes of society. And it remained that way for 300 years. Only these high society people could afford to eat meat. As a result, French words like porc (pork) and beouf (beef) came into the English language. However, poor English farmers raised the animals. So the English language _ the words pig and cow from the Native Anglo-Saxon.\nThe Norman French added about 10,000 French words to the English language. Seventy-five percent of them are still in use today.\nIn French grammar, nouns have either a male or female gender  , so adjectives   take different forms for each. English has only one adjective that does this, and it came from French. The word \"blond\" describes someone with light-colored hair. \"Blond\" is used for men, and \"blonde\" describes women. And they are also nouns.\nSome French words that entered the English language have taken on completely different meanings. The French phrase \"a la mode\" means \"in style\". In English, the phrase means \"with the ice cream\". Someone must have decided something eaten with ice cream was in style!\nNow, as you learn English, you're on your way to learning French!"

      "As my dad unwrapped  the new bicycle helmet that I got him for his birthday, I realized that a number of people ride their bicycles every day without the protection of a helmet.\nDue to cold winters across the country, riding has become increasingly dangerous as many roads have potholes and are torn-up  . Not everyone realizes that there are laws requiring the wearing of helmets in many places.\nWhere I live, there has been a law in place since October 1, 1992 stating that cyclists of all ages are required to wear helmets. Unfortunately, accidents can happen to the best of riders. My dad has been a cyclist for many years, and he often rides around my county and to Rockland Lake State Park.\nOne afternoon, as he was just entering the park, he lost control of his bicycle and flew off and landed on a nearby patch of grass, breaking his helmet into pieces and losing consciousness . When he was just awakening, a lovely couple found him and brought him back to our house, where he attempted to recap the events leading up to his fall. Later that day, a CAT scan showed that he had a concussion  . That evening, while my dad was showing me the pieces of his broken helmet, _ .\nIf he had not worn his helmet, he probably would have cracked his skull and perhaps died.

      "My name is Toby. I'm eighty-three years old now. I once knew the greatest man in England. William Shakespeare was his name. I first met William near a big field of apple trees in the town named Stratford in October, 1579. He told me he was 15 years old. He was two years older than me. He had a sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Gilbert and Richard. And the next year he had another brother, Edmund. After William's parents died, he and his sister lived with his mother's brother. I became his friend from that day until he died. We met nearly every day. We were friends for thirty years.\nI once worked with him in the theatre, through the good times and the bad times. William was good at acting. He could make all kinds of people pleased. By 1592, he became very famous. He was always busy day and night. I don't know when he slept. He not only acted in plays, but also wrote his own plays. In his whole life, William wrote 37 plays in all. He was the best  _ in England.\nHe wrote a play about love in 1595. It was Romeo and Juliet. He once used my name, Toby, in his play--Twelfth Night. In this play, Sir Toby Belch was a big fat man, who liked drinking too much and having a good time. Queen Elizabeth the First watched this play on the 6thof January, 1601. She liked it.\nWilliam Shakespeare is dead now, of course. He has been dead for more than thirty years. There's no singing, no dancing, no plays. It isn't like that in my young days.

      "In the tenth grade,I began working for free at a vet's that was run by a friend. I wanted to get experience for what I thought would be my future job. However,on one particular Saturday morning I learnt something perhaps more important.\nThe hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and some people could only pay for the most basic treatments. On this Saturday,a man and his young son,who was probably about 7 years old,walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. There was something wrong with the cat's left eye. But the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine. He kept quiet for a while,and then he asked where the nearest animal shelter was. Hearing this,his son cried and started to argue with him. All of a sudden,an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up,walked up to the counter,and told the man that she would pay for the cost. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat.\nI always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person,but I only saw people do acts of kindness on TV or in movies. What the woman did made me believe that these things do happen in real life,and quite often.\nNow,when I can't decide whether to help someone who is in need,I remember this woman,and then I have the courage to step up to the plate.

      "Compared to night owls , people who rise early feel happier and more satisfied with life overall.\nBut the good news for teenagers is that most people become earlier risers as they age, and this change is also associated with greater feelings of happiness. Researchers at the University of Toronto asked more than 700 people about their preferred time of day and how healthy and happy they generally feel.\nThey then compared the responses of the group of younger adults aged 17 to  38 with older people ages 59 to 79. Only about seven percent of young adults are morning larks , while by age 60 most people preferred to be up with the dawn. Just seven percent of the oldest people in the study described themselves as night owls.\n\"We found that older adults reported greater positive emotion than younger adults, and older adults were more likely to be morning - type people than younger adults,\" study researcher Renee Biss from the University of Toronto reportedly told LiveScience. The \"morningness\" was associated with greater happiness emotions in both age groups.\nMorning trypes also tended to report that they felt healthier than the late risers, according to the study that published in the journal Emition. The researchers said that this apparent health benefit could come from the extra sleep they would enjoy, as their sleeping schedule would fit with society's expectations of rising early for work.\nThis extra sleep could not only make them feel more clear -mined, but may also  _ their immune system.\n\"An evening person may go throught their week feeling unhappy because they have to get up earlier than they would like to\". But Ms Biss said there was hope for night owls as it was possible for them to turn themselves into morning people.\n\"One way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning, and to wake up earlier and go to bed earlier,\" she said. \"It's easiest if you have a consistent schedule, to make sure you are waking up at the same time every day.\""

      "On a number of drives throughout my childhood, my mother would suddenly pull over the car to examine a flower by the side of the road or rescue a beetle  from tragedy while I, in my late teens and early twenties, sat impatiently in the car.\nThough Mother's Day follows Earth Day, for me, they have always been related to each other. My mom has been \"green\" since she became concerned about the environment. Part of this habit was born of thrift  . Like her mother and her grandmother before her, mom saves glass jars, empty cheese containers and reuses her plastic bags.\nMom creates a kind of harmonious relationship with wildlife in her yard. She knows to pick the apples on her trees a little early to avoid the bears and that if she leaves the bird feeders  out at night, it is likely that they will be knocked down by a family of raccoons  . Spiders that make their way into the house and are caught in juice glasses will be set loose in the garden.\nI try to teach my children that looking out for the environment starts with being aware of the environment. On busy streets, we look for dandelions   to fly in the wind; we say hello to neighborhood cats and pick up plastic cups and paper bags. This teaching comes easily, I realize, because I was taught so well by example. Mom didn't need to lecture; she didn't need to beat a drum to change the world. She simply slowed down enough to enjoy living in it and with that joy came mercy and an instinct for protection.\nI am slowing down and it isn't because of the weight of my nearly forty years on the planet, it is out of my concern for the planet itself. I've begun to save glass jars and reuse packing envelopes. I pause in my daily tasks to watch the squirrels race each other in the trees above my house.\nLast summer, in the company of my son and daughter, I planted tomatoes in my yard. With the heat of August around me, I ate the first while sitting on my low wall with dirt on my hands. Warm from the sun, it burst on my tongue with sweetness.

      "Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.\nSocial support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems."

      "Often people use laptops  on trains and airplanes, in airports and hotels. These laptops connect people to their workplace. In the United States today, laptops also connect students to their classrooms.\nWestlake College in Virginia will start a laptop computer program that allows students to do schoolwork anywhere they want. Within five years, each of the 1,500 students at the college will receive a laptop. The laptops are part of a $10 million computer program at Westlake, a 110yearold college. The students with laptops will also have connection with the Internet. Besides, they will be able to use email to \"speak\" with their teachers, their classmates, and their families. However, the most important part of the laptop program is that students will be able to use computers without going to computer labs. They can work with it at home, in a fast-food restaurant or under the trees--anywhere at all!\nBecause of the many changes in computer technology, laptop use in higher education, such as colleges and universities, is workable  . As laptops become more powerful, they become more similar to desktop computers. Also, the portable computers can connect students to not only the Internet, but also libraries and other resources. State higher education officials are studying how laptops can help students. State officials are also testing laptop programs at other universities, too."

      "A dog, it is said, is a man's best friend. Put a dog, a kid and a book together, and you have a struggling reader's best friend.\nThe therapy dogs of R.E.A.D. - Reading Education Assistance Dogs - have been helping children improve their reading skills since 1999, when Intermountain Therapy Animals (ITA) began the program in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nToday, tens of thousands of R.E.A.D. teams - dogs and their owners - volunteer to spend time with youngsters in schools and libraries across the United States and around the world. The idea is that sharing a book with a nonjudgmental   partner encourages students' confidence and helps develop a love of reading.\nIzzy, a Havanese therapy dog, is a regular visitor to Public School 57 in East Harlem, New York. Students meet him in the library, pick out a book and sit down on the carpet. Izzy snuggles   up to them and gets ready to hear a story.\n\"I love reading to Izzy because he listens to me, and he doesn't make fun of me when I make a mistake,\" says third-grader Aelane Vasquez. The 9-year-old, whose parents are from Mexico, is one of 15 Latin-American students at the school who were selected for the program.\n\"All the students that we work with in the R.E.A.D. program were behind reading levels at the beginning of the year,\" Bridget McElroy, who teaches English as a Second Language, explained. \"Now most of them have reached the average level, if not above it.\" That's important, because achieving proficiency   in reading is vital for kids to succeed. Studies have shown that students who can't read at grade level by the end of third grade are four times less likely to graduate high school by the age of 19.\nThe R.E.A.D. teams from New York Therapy Animals work with 175 kids at Public School 57 and nine other schools.\nMcElroy said she sees a marked difference in Aelane and her classmates, and not just in study. \"Not only do the kids have time to practice reading, what we are really seeing is that they are excited to read and practice even when Izzy is not here,\" she said."

      "Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!"

      "\"S. H.E. is going to sing at the CCTV annual Spring Festival Evening Party, is that true?\" cried out Peng Weiye, a Senior 2 girl in Shanghai and die-hard S. H.E. fan.\nAfter checking it on the Internet, Peng quickly phoned friends to spread the news. For fans like her, S. H. E. 's performance is perhaps the only part of the old fashioned evening to get excited about.\nThe Taiwanese band is made up of Selina, Hebe and Ella. Their name comes from the first letter of each of the singers' English names.\nLast week S. H. E. announced they would perform in Las Vegas, US, over Christmas and then in Guangzhou on January 15.\nAt their Shanghai show on October 30, hundreds of parents waited outside the Hongkou Stadium. Inside, thousands of teenagers sang, cried and shouted as the band performed.\n\"I love their music, healthy image and everything related to them. Thank God that, although my parents don't understand why I love them so much, they still bought me a ticket for that show,\" said Peng about the Shanghai performance.\nIt is not just on the mainland that the three girls have made audiences much excited. In the past year the band has passed through Taiwan, Hong Kong and even Singapore and Malaysia.\nWhen the three high school girls entered a singing contest in Taiwan in 2000, none of them ever dreamed of being a superstar. \"We had never met before, and we didn't talk at all at the beginning,\" recalled Ella.\nWhen asked about the secret of their success, she said, \"Our average looks and not-so-expensive clothes keep us close to our fans. We are happy to be the girls next door, your singing sisters.\"\n\"It's really a magical journey, from day-dreaming high school girls to singers performing on the same stage as our idols .

      "There are hundreds of expressions of words using \"hand\" in the English language. Let us examine some of the expressions that use \"hand\".\nWe will get a hand in this way. \"To get a hand in\" is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it. When we learn completely, we will be able to do it hands down. If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand. On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, it is out of control.\nWe must consider another way of expressing phrase---- to hand it to someone. For example, I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far. You can also lend a hand to someone but without really giving up your hand. You lend a hand when you help someone. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us. We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.\nNow, we have a free hand to continue examining other \"hand\" expressions. It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.\nMaybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project. It would have to be someone who was interested in these expressions. Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand. Of course, there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand. That means he wants to tale it over. If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seams hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project to wash our hands of \" hand\" expressions."

      "Cultural differences in business entertaining include problems such as whom one entertains and where and how one entertains. In countries where status is important, it is not advisable to invite people of different statuses to the same dinner party. Americans will often invite people to their homes. However, in some societies the home is considered too personal, unworthy, or too small to serve as a proper place for business entertaining. In some countries there is a \"help yourself\" method of entertaining done in the home. This method does not work well when entertaining people whose culture teaches them to wait to be asked three times before accepting an offer of food. For example, a Chinese guest went hungry all the evening without eating though he was quite hungry because he was too shy to take food after only being asked to do so once. In another case, an American woman executive  was being entertained in London. After having the tea served, the American woman helped herself to cream and sugar rather than waiting to be served. The English hostess was upset by the thought that she was not serving quickly enough.\nAs a general rule, a small gift from your home country is OK. A gift that is tied to the particular interest of the person is especially good. Gifts for children are also well received. Be careful that the \"hometown\" gift you are bringing to Singapore is not made in Hong Kong. Because many gifts carry symbolic meanings, it is always best to seek the advice of a cultural information before selecting gifts. The giving of large gifts, or payments for special service, should only be carried out after talking with legal department in the home and host culture."

      "They say that Mexico is a country no one ever leaves. Every year, millions of tourists pass through. And Mexicans happily warn that a part of them will remain behind forever. Most visitors are vacationing North Americans who go up on the brilliant beaches of Cancun, Acapulco, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta. The beaches, of course, are among the world's best ----but those who venture   inland are rewarded with the true soul of Mexico.\nAnd it is a big soul. The Republic of Mexico is vast, consisting of nearly two million square miles of coastline, desert, rain forest, mountains, and rich plains. From the American borderlands of the wide, agriculturally rich north, the country narrows gently as it sweeps south and east. The two main mountain ranges , the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental, hug the west and east, finally merging  into the volcanically active central highlands and the capital, Mexico City - the most populous city in the world. Further south, the country narrows to only 100 miles, then broadens again before reaching the Guatemalan border. There are two major peninsulas   in Mexico: the Baja Peninsula to the west and the Yucatan peninsular to the east.\nThe population is about 106 million. and the generosity   of the Mexican people is _ . Knowing a few simple sentences in Spanish will win hearts.\nMexico has been blessed with an unusually temperate   climate year-round. The most important thing to remember is that the Mexican summer is also the rainy season, although the rain rarely lasts more than a few hours, and typically arrives in the late afternoon. Extremes are present only in the North and in Baja, both of which have deserts where the temperature leaps above 100F. Mexico City has a year-round temperature in the high 80s. while the coasts usually stay in the mid-90s. Night time temperatures fall somewhat, but rarely break down below a comfortable 60F."

      "The popular song 'Gangnam Style' from South Korean recording artist PSY has just become the most watched video on YouTube ever, getting more than 808 million views on the popular media site.\nThe distinction was previously held by another pop heavyweight, Justin Bieber, whose song 'Baby' had a little more than 804 million views at press time. PSY made the announcement on his Twitter page earlier today.\nSince its release, the song has defeated such other popular videos as Jennifer Lopez's 'On the Floor' and Eminem's 'Love the Way You Lie'. And in September, 'Gangnam Style' also became the most liked video on YouTube, now with nearly 5.4 million thumbs up.\nAt the time of the announcement, the Guinness Book of World Records released a statement saying: \"In years past it was unthinkable that something would be viewed a hundred million times, and now Gangnam Style has achieved more than twice this figure in just three months on YouTube. PSY, your certificate is waiting here at our office, come pick it up any time!\"\nDespite its massive popularity, the video shows no signs of slowing down, and it even has a shot at becoming the first video to get more than one billion views.\nIf it maintains its current rate of around six million new views per day, 'Gangnam Style' would be in line to break that record by the end of the year.\nThe YouTube honors are just the latest in a long list that shows just how popular the song has become. Since it was released in July, the song has seen a meteoric rise through the music industry.\nIt has found its way to the tops of music charts in more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Canada, while providing material for thousands of parody videos.\nIt became part of the 2012 presidential elections with the now famous 'Mitt Romney Style' video and was even used by the North Korean government in propaganda films promoting their supreme leader.\nMeanwhile, such influential figures as President Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt have all made mention of the hit song."

      "It was the summer of 1936.The Olympic Games were being held in Berlin.I had trained, sweated and disciplined myself for 6 years on the running broad jump.A year before, as a college student at the Ohio State, I'd set the world's record of 26 feet 8 1/4 inches.Nearly everyone expected me to win.\n _ When the time came for the broad-jump trials , I was shocked to see a tall boy hitting the pit   at almost 26 feet on his practice leaps.He turned out to be a German named Luz Long.He had easily qualified for the finals on his first attempt.\nA nervous athlete is an athlete who will make mistakes.I fouled  twice on my qualifying jumps.Walking a few yards from the pit, I kicked at the dirt disgustedly.Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.I turned to look into the friendly blue eyes of Luz Long.\"Hi, I'm Luz Long.I don't think we've met.\" \"Glad to meet you,\" I said.Then, trying to hide my nervousness, I added, \"How are you?\" \"I'm fine.Something must be eating you.You should be able to qualify with your eyes closed.\" He said.\nHe seemed to understand my nervousness, and took pains to reassure me.Finally, seeing that I had calmed down somewhat, he said, \"What does it matter if you're not the first in the trials? Tomorrow is what counts.\" All the tension left my body as the truth of what he said hit me.Confidently I qualified with almost a foot to spare.\nLuz broke his own record and pushed me on to a peak performance.The instant I landed from my final jump--the one which set the Olympic record of 26 feet 5 1/16 inches--he was at my side, congratulating me."

      "The North and South poles are remote and freezing places that receive lots of animal visitors but few human tourists.\nBut even if you never plan to visit the polar bears in the north or penguins in the south, now is a perfect time to start thinking about them. That's because 2007 marks the beginning of the International Polar Year (IPY), a two-year-old activity of science projects that aim to show how important the poles are to the health of our planet. During the IPY, which will last until March 2009, thousands of researchers from more than 60 countries will conduct more than 200 projects and expeditions  to both the top and bottom of the world.\nIn recent years, the polar regions have begun to change severely as a result of global warming. Temperatures there are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and snow in these regions are melting  at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk.\nOnly by studying the poles, say IPY researchers, can we find ways to protect them and ourselves.\nBoth the Arctic and the Antarctic are cold and remote, but the two regions have important differences. For one thing, the Arctic is an ice-covered ocean surrounded by land. The Antarctic, on the other hand, is a continent of ice-covered land surrounded by water.\nMost polar studies have focused on the Arctic, and that is where scientists have observed the most remarkable changes in the ice. During a typical year, Arctic ice expands  in the winter and shrinks  in the summer. But recently, the amount of ice covering the ocean has been steadily dropping in both seasons."

Some, however, find that putting one's life online can have a price.

And 38 % of teens say they read other people's blogs. By comparison, about a tenth of adults have their own blogs and a quarter say they read other people's online magazines.\nWith the development of the Internet, more and more people will be attracted by blogging.\nIn another study, 79% of teens agree that people at their age aren't careful enough when giving out information about themselves online. Besides, careless blogging can also influence blog readers. When you are angry or unhappy, your blog is the first place you turn to. The words you post then may not be _ which you may regret later.

      "Remember how great exercise was when you were a little kid? Back then,racing around the playground or skipping rope for hours,you weren't thinking fitness,you were thinking entertainment.But in this age of high-tech home equipment and underused gym memberships,the simple joy of jumping rope has been forgotten.Rediscovering it will give you a total-body exercise you can find.\nAlthough considered an excellent form of exercise,jumping rope has never gained widespread acceptance because of two fundamental reasons.First,most people recognize jumping rope as an excellent form of cardiovascular   exercise,but they also believe that it is simply too difficult.In other words,they don't think they'll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes that it takes to achieve a beneficial physical result.Second, many view it as somewhat boring and too repetitive-not as something fun or enjoyable.\nAs a matter of fact,jumping rope can be great fun if you find a proper way to practise it.Instead of doing the usual two-foot bounce over and over again,people good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps.A single bounce,a double bounce,a skip,a knee-up,side swings,as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping.\nNow researchers are learning that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning.It is an exercise allowing both brain hemispheres to perform in parallel to each other.In short,jumping rope can be a life-long activity requiring little equipment,time and space,yet leading to a much healthier life."

      "An idea that started in Seattle's public library has spread throughout America and beyond.The concept is simple: help to build a sense of community in a city by getting everyone to read the same book at the same time.\nIn addition to encouraging reading as a pursuit   to be enjoyed by all, the program allows strangers to communicate by discussing the book on the bus, as well as promoting reading as an experience to be shared in families and schools.The idea came from Seattle librarian Nancy Pearl who launched  the \"If All of Seattle Read the Same Book \" project in 1998.Her original program used author visits, study guides and book discussion groups to bring people together with a book, but the idea has since expanded to many other American cities, and even to Hong Kong.\nIn Chicago, the mayor appeared on television to announce the choice of To Kill a Mockingbird as the first book in the \"One Book, One Chicago\" program.As a result, reading clubs and neighborhood groups sprang up around the city.Across the US, stories emerged of parents and children reading to each other at night and strangers chatting away on the bus about plot and character.\nThe only problem arose in New York, where local readers could not decide on one book to represent the huge and diverse population. This may show that the idea works best in medium-sized cities or large towns, where a greater sense of unity can be achieved. Or it may show that New Yorkers rather missed the point, putting all their energy and passion into the choice of the book rather than discussion about a book itself.\nUltinatelas Nancy points out, the level of success is not measured by how many people read a book, but by how many people are enriched by the process, or have enjoyed speaking to someone with whom they would not otherwise have shared a word."

      "The Pew report---which was based on surveys carried out in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic --- concluded that the European Union was \" the new sick man of Europe\".\nThe percentage of Europeans with a favorable view of the EU has plunged from 60 percent last year to 45 percent now.\nThe UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic country, but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months, slipping only two points to 43 percent.\nBy contrast, France's backing for the EU has slipped sharply, from 60 percent last year to 41 percent today.\nOn the question of whether to remain in the EU, 46 percent of the British want to leave the union and surprisingly, the same percentage went to stay.\nThe Pew report's authors said, \"The long-drawn economic crisis has created bad forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and Germans from everyone else.\"\nThey added, \"The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the main disaster of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in a bad reputation across much of Europe.\"\nThe only European leader rated highly by their own voters was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with 74 percent voters in favor of her.\nPrime Minister David Cameron was the next highest with a positive score of 37 percent among the British public, although he can take some comfort from the fact that 58 percent of Poles and half of all French people think he is doing a good job.\nIn spite of the dark economic future and growing doubt of the EU, there were strong majorities of more than 60 percent in favor of keeping the euro in the five countries surveyed that use the single currency."

      "Carlos had been in New York for five months now, and he _ it. He would never forget the day when the plane landed. His parents had big smiles on their faces as they discussed the wonderful new life they would have in this great city. His older sister and brother looked in wonder and excitement at the buildings. Uncle Miguel and Aunt Esperanza thought of the good jobs they would get. Grandmother and Grandfather told him what a lucky boy he was to come to this wonderful city. But Carlos was lonely. The city looked big, cold and dirty to him.\nThey lived in an apartment in Manhattan. There were stores and cinemas close to their home. But Carlos didn't want these things. He loved his home in the country in Puerto Rico; he loved the green fields, the hot sun, and the lovely beaches.\nHe didn't want to go to school because it made him think of his friends at home. And he didn't want to learn a new language that he could never describe the world as beautifully as his own.\nHe began to go the dock , because this made him feel closer to Puerto Rico. He sat down and watched the ships. He would often find a man also sitting there looking at the sea. The man was Eric--a taxi driver who came there to escape from the noisy traffic.\nEric noticed the young boy and felt his sadness. One day he said, \"Yes, it's hard to leave your homeland. I remember when I left Norway 15 years ago. I know it's hard to start a new life in a new country, but let's face it. I did it, and you can do it, too.\"\nFrom then on the taxi driver and the young boy began to develop a deep friendship."

      "Windbreaks are barriers formed by trees and other plants.Farmers plant these barriers around their fields,which help prevent the loss of soil,and stop the wind from blowing soil away.They also keep the wind from damaging or destroying crops.Besides,extra trees and plants can be cut down and used or sold for wood.\nWindbreaks can be highly valuable for protecting grain crops.For example,in parts of West Africa grain harvests were as much as twenty percent higher in fields protected by windbreaks compared with fields without them.\nBut here is something interesting about windbreaks.They seem to work best when they allow some wind to pass through the barrier of trees or plants around a field.If not,then the movement of air close to the ground will lift the soil.Then the soil will be blown away.For this reason,a windbreak works best if it contains only 60 to 80 percent of the trees and plants that would be needed to make a solid line.An easy rule to remember is that windbreaks can protect areas up to 10 times the height of the tallest trees in the windbreak.\nThere should be at least two lines in each windbreak.One line should be large trees.The second line,right next to it,can be shorter trees or other plants with leaves.Locally grown trees and plants are considered the best choices for windbreaks.Trees reduce the damaging effects of wind and rain.Their roots help protect soil from being washed away.And trees can provide animals outdoors with shade from the sun."

      "My room faces the sun in the morning and on clear summer mornings it wakes me bright and fresh, no matter what time I stayed up till; I'll get up and make breakfast. \nThis morning I wake up suddenly, like the alarm clock in my head has given me a little electric shock; it isn't sunny outside. I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. \nHearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He's down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. \n\"Morning.\" I say. \n\"Uh huh.\" \nI leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . \nThis morning I want to think a while. Today is Dad's birthday; Mom won't mention it. My brother might, just to _ , so I'll keep him sweet when he comes in from work. Every year on my dad's birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I'm an artist. It's not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully. I know it.\nI read a lot of books too, mainly about artists, and I try to paint like them. When my dad comes back I'll be able to say \"this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet\" or \"this is you on your thirty-eighth birthday, when I was fourteen, and you'd been gone five years, and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\" And he'll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him. \nOn Saturday mornings he'd take me to town and I'd drag him around the art shops. On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie's. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils. Some mornings I'd wake up and there'd be a book on my pillow about Picasso, or Chagall.\n\"Draw me,\" he'd say. \n\"Aw, Dad, I can't.\"\nI know I should go to school; I'm not one of those kids who are scared to go. But, it's my dad's birthday and I think I must spend it with him. \nSo I spend some time thinking about his hair, which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year; I know hair doesn't age at the same speed every year, but I make his hair longer this year. And in my mind's eye I give him an extra few pounds too. But I keep the smile fixed in my head, like it is when he's happy. \nIt's head and shoulders, so I'll put him in a T-shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black. \nI try to think of how much I want to show and how much I want to tell. \nThen I pick up a charcoal stick  and do it. I pick up a chalk to add a suggestion of color1 to his eyes, then another chalk for his mouth. \nAnd there he is. \nDad. \nThere  _ are."

      "Eyesight problems are common among all ages and if they are left untreated, they can cause serious headaches or other problems. The good news is that most eyesight problems can easily be sorted out by wearing glasses.\nRegular eye tests are important for everyone. Children and teenagers, under the age of 16 and up to the age of 19 for those full-time education, have the right to have eye tests for free in Britain. As the eye test is free, there's no excuse for not having a regular eye test. Doctors suggest that it's better to have an eye test about once a year.\nWearing glasses isn't always regarded as all that cool and teens who suddenly need to wear glasses may find it difficult to accept. If they've grown up wearing glasses, then they may be more used to it. However, if your eyes are in poor health, not wearing glasses can put even more pressure on your eyes and could make them even worse.\nThankfully, the days of little choice of glasses frames   for teenagers are gone and there's now a wide selection of frames. If a teen does need to wear glasses, then it's good to let him or her choose the type, as he or she will be able to choose something he or she feels comfortable. Don't forget to be guided by the experts on glasses too."

On Midsummer's Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willington and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back until midday on Sunday. His men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out chatting without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back, he immediately went to sleep on the living-room sofa with the \"News of the World\" over his face. When evening came, the animals were still not fed. At last, they could stand no longer. One of the cows broke into the door of the storehouse with her horns and all the animals began to help themselves to the grains. \nIt was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the storehouse with whips in their hands, whipping in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals would bear. Together though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they jumped upon their makers. Mr. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being struck with the horns and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen these animals act like this before.

      "Falling temperatures are no excuse to avoid outdoor exercise with your dog. Along with making sure you are appropriately dressed, your dog should also be properly protected from the elements. Some large breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds and Huskies can tolerate the colder weather better than others. These dogs may also develop a thicker coat over time as they are exposed to colder weather.\n Smaller breeds, however, like Chihuahuas and Miniature Pinschers, breeds with short coats and puppies should wear some type of protection, i.e, a coat or sweater, if the temperature drops too low. Look for coats or sweaters with high collars or a turtleneck that covers your dog from the base of the tail on top to the belly underneath.\n Dog booties   provide good protection from chemicals or salts on the pavement as well as mud. If you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside.\n Other tips\nWhen you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. It is especially important to keep your dog well groomed   during the winter months to protect him from the elements.\n If your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. Dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced.\n The amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age. Remember that ill or elderly dogs are more sensitive to cold weather. Dogs whom cold weather agrees with can spend hours outside without getting cold but some of the smaller and younger dogs' exercise sessions should be kept shorter. Dogs should not be left outside unattended.\n Another activity to consider is doggie daycare, which is an excellent alternative during cold weather months. It's a great place for your dog to get plenty of physical and mental stimulation while being with other dogs.\n Banfield Pet Hospital"

      "\"Croeso I Gymru!,\" If you don't know what this means, read on to find out more.\nWhen you cross over the border from England into Wales, you don't have to show your passport but you do notice a difference immediately. All the road markings and signs are shown in two languages -- English and Welsh  . Not all visitors to Britain know that other languages are spoken here. There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh. People surf the Internet in Welsh, keep up with friends on Facebook and write blogs in Welsh.\nBy the way,\"Croeso I Gymru!\" means \"Welcome to Wales!\"  I hope you'll be able to visit it one day."

      "\"Mobile phones killed our man,\"screamed one headline last year.Also came statements that an unpublished study had found that mobile phones cause memory loss. And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones heat the brain.For anyone who uses a mobile phone,these are worring times.But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scared and you will hear a different story.\nWhat we do have,however,are some results suggesting that mobile phones'emission  have a variety of strange effects on living tissue that can't be explained by the general radiation biology.And it's only when the questions raised by these experiments are answered that we'll be able to say for sure what moblie phones might be doing to the brain.\nOne of the strange effects comes from the now famous \"memory loss\" study Alan Preece and his colleagues at the University of Bristol placed a device  that copied the microwave emission of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers.The volunteers were all good at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen.Preece says he still can't comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end.But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive  abilities.\"I'm pretty sure there is no effect on short-term memory,\"he says.\nAnother expert,Tatterasll,remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss.One result,for instance,suggests that nerve cell synapses  exposed to microwaves become more--rather than less--receptive to under--going changes linked to the memory formation.\nIt would be an even happier outcome if microwave turned out to be good for you.It sounds crazy,but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California,found that mice exposed to microwave for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours  when given a cancer--causing chemical.\nSo should we forget about mobile phone radiation causing brain tumours and making us unable to think clearly or reasonably?\n\"If it doesn't certainly cause cancer in animals and cells, then it probably isn't going to cause cancer in humans,\"says William.And while there's still no absolute evidence that mobile phone does damage your memories or give your cancer,the _ is:Don't panic."

      "It's said that one can know the nature of both man and woman by their behaviors at table. Indeed table manners are closely related to one's life and one's job. As the saying goes\" When in Rome, do as the Romans do\", English learners should know what the proper table manners are in western countries if invited to a dinner party. The followings are some suggestions that may be helpful to you.\nThe first important thing you need to know is when to begin eating. Before dinner, the hostess usually serves guests first and herself last. So do not eat as soon as you are served but wait until the hostess has also been served and has picked up her fork as the signal to begin. But at a large dinner party where there are many guests, the hostess may ask everyone to begin eating as soon as they are served. If you want to talk while eating, your mouth should certainly not be full of food because it is considered very bad manners. But it is possible to speak with a little food in the mouth. When you have to answer a question, naturally you must wait until the food in your mouth is eaten.\nWhen a dish is passed to you with a fork in the plate, you should use it to take your food. Do not take too much at a time and make sure that the other guests can have enough food.\nAnyway, good table manners are very important and they are not so simple as we thought. But it is necessary for one to know what good table manners are because they can help one succeed in his life!"

      "Each time a city building is set up, the grass in that spot and trees that once reached up to the sky are replaced by a tar   roof. In addition to that, roads, parking lots, and yet more buildings are being constructed. The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven. But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden?\nWhether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or meadow grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs. If used more widely, green roofs could decrease a city's total energy costs, reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage   systems, and actually extend the life time of the roof itself. And green roofs do something else: They beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th. Now that's a great achievement.\nThe environmental nonprofit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs progamme.

      "Most people think of zoos as safe heavens for animals, where problems such as difficulty finding food and avoiding predators   don't exist. Therefore, animals in zoos should live to a ripe old age.\nBut that may not be true for the largest land animals on earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often suffer from poor health. They develop diseases and they are even unable to have babies.\nTo learn more about how captivity   affects elephants, a team of international scientists compared the lifespans   of the zoo-born elephants with the lifespans of thousands of wild elephants. They also compared some Asian elephants living in zoos with some Asian elephants which work in logging camp  , over almost the same time period.\nThe team found that elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years, but elephants that died of natural causes lived an average of 56 years. Asian elephants followed a similar pattern. In zoos, they lived 18.9 years, while those in the logging camp lived 41.7 years.\nScientists don't yet know why wild elephants seem to live so much better than their zoo-raised counterparts  . Georgia Mason, a biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, who led the study, thinks stress and obesity   may be to blame. Zoo elephants don't get the same kind of exercise they would in the wild. Elephants' social lives are also much different in zoos than in the wild, where they live in large family groups."

      "It happened to me recently. I was telling someone how much I had enjoyed reading Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father and how it had changed my views of our President.

But I am pleased to say that, unlike 42 percent of people, I have read the book at number one, George Orwell's 1984. I think it's really brilliant.\nThe World Book Day report also has some other interesting information in it. It says that many people lie about having read Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky(I haven't read him, but haven't lied about it either )and Herman Melville.\nAsked why they lied, the most common reason was to \"impress\" someone they were speaking to. This could be tricky if the conversation became more in -depth!\nBut when asked which authors they actually enjoy, people named J. k. Rowling, John Grisham, Sophie Kinsella (ah, the big sellers, in other words). Forty-two percent of people asked admitted they turned to the back of the book to read the end before finishing the story(I'll come clean: I do this and am astonished that 58 percent said they had never done so)."

      "Sarah Alexander celebrated the start of her last year at Wells College the way many other seniors before her had. She ran across the picturesque campus to the shores of Cayuga Lake, where she jumped into the water. \nSo did many of her fellow seniors. But dozens of students decided to stay away, especially the  ly few newly arrived male students. \nWells College, which since 1868 had educated only women, began accepting men this year in hopes of supporting its decreasing enrollment. \nFor many students and alumnae, it was a crushing decision. After the college announced last October that it would go co-educational, about half of the students protested and two filed a lawsuit, which they later dropped. \nThe students--33 men and 383 women--came to campus late last month. Both sexes are now trying to navigate the new social landscape. Mr. Phillips said \"You can't do guy stuff. Every time you want to sit and watch sports or a game, it turns into a movie.\" \nThe women were \"somewhat nasty.\" \"I could see the dirty looks in their eyes,\" he said. \"But I was not going to let that stop me from coming.\"\nWells was a place where women did not have to fuss over their appearance or fight to be taken seriously by their professors. They could enjoy the friendship of their campus sisters and their playful traditions. Besides jumping into the lake, the women dance around the maypole each May and kiss the feet of the statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, before exams. \nMs. Alexander said, \"People told us we wouldn't notice a difference, but from the moment men arrived on campus you could notice a difference. Women are waking up early to put on makeup, and that's odd,\" she said. \nHenry Wells, a founder of Wells Fargo and a friend of Cornell's donator, Ezra Cornell established this college, when women were not considered capable of higher learning. \"Give her the opportunity,\" he wrote.\nThe news that the college would go coed created ripples far beyond campus. One alumna wrote a letter to the college's president, Lisa Marsh Ryerson, saying the founder would haunt her. \"I believe Henry Wells would have haunted me if I let Wells College close,\" said Ms. Marsh Ryerson, a Wells alumna herself. \nThe great-great-great-great granddaughter of Henry Wells, Stephanie Redmond, 18, of Washington State, said that earlier this year a Wells student had tracked her down and asked her to support the protest. But Ms. Redmond said the move to admit men had encouraged her to enroll at Wells this year as a freshman. She plans on a career in engineering, a male-dominated field, and said attending an all-women's college might have put her at a disadvantage."

I know kids who have been shot or beaten up. I have friends who ended up in prison. I could have ended up that way,too,but Mr. Clark wouldn't let that happen.\nMr. Clark worked long hours,making sure I did my work. My grades rose. In fact,the scores of our whole class rose. One day,he took our class to see The Phantom of the Opera,and it was the first time some kids had ever been out of Harlem. Before the show,he treated us to dinner at a restaurant and taught us not to talk with our mouths full. We did not want to let him down. Mr. Clark was selected as Disney's 2000 Teacher of the Year. He said he would draw three names out of a hat;those students would go with him to Los Angeles to get the award. But when the time came to draw names,Mr. Clark said,\"You're all going.\"\nOn graduation day,there were a lot of tears. We didn't want his class to end. In 2001,he moved to Atlanta,but we always kept in touch. He started giving lectures about education,and wrote a bestselling book based on his classroom rules,The Essential. In 2003,Mr. Clark took some of us on a trip to South Africa to deliver school supplies and visit the orphanages .It was the most amazing experience of my life. It's now my dream to one day start a group of women's clubs,helping people from all backgrounds."

      "Once a girl named Lily got married, but soon she found that she couldn't get along with her mother-in-law at all. Finally, Lily could not stand her mother-in-law's bad temper and decided to do something about it.\nLily turned to Mr. Huang, who sold herbs  , for help. She asked if he could give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all. Mr. Huang thought for a while and said: \"Lily, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and do what I tell you.\" Lily agreed.\nHe told Lily, \"You can't use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day, prepare some delicious food and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, to make sure that nobody suspects you when she dies, you must be very friendly towards her.\" Lily thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot to murder her mother-in-law.\nThus every other day, Lily served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother. After six months had passed, the whole household changed. Lily and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter.\nOne day, Lily came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again. She said: \"Mr. Huang, please help me to stop the poison from killing my mother-in-law! I do not want her to die.\"\nMr. Huang smiled, saying, \"Lily, there is nothing to worry about.

      "Mark Twain (1835-1910) - we've all heard the name, but what makes him \"the father of American literature\" as classic US author William Faulkner once called him?\nMark Twain is someone Americans are taught to love. Older relatives, English teachers and the media always praise him. But when you actually take the time to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you find that his work is more wonderful than you could've ever imagined.\nThe novel describes a young boy named Tom Sawyer growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. He explores the countryside on a riverboat with his friends, falls in love with girls, starts secret clubs and searches for treasure. Twain's idea of childhood is magical - a time of imagination, wonder and, of course, adventure.\nMore importantly, through the eyes of Tom Sawyer, Twain cleverly makes fun of US culture. For example, Tom hates going to church, and Twain uses scenes of Tom there to _ religion   and its old traditions. \"Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it,\" he writes in one chapter.\nTwain's writing is full of these kinds of critical   points about culture and politics. That's why he is so loved in the US - he wasn't afraid to state his opinions, and he did so clearly. For instance, Twain didn't like US wars abroad. In 1900, after the US invaded   the Philippines, Twain wrote in a newspaper article: \"We do not intend to free, but to subjugate   the people of the Philippines... We have gone there to conquer.\" He also believed strongly in women's right to vote in elections and gave a famous speech on the subject, called \"Votes for Women\", in 1901.\n\"Tom was a glittering hero once more - the pet of the old, the envy of the young,\" Twain writes in Tom Sawyer. But he could just as well be describing himself."

      "The weather predictions for Asia in 2050 read like a story from a _ movie.\nMany experts and green groups fear they will come true unless there is a united global effort to hold back greenhouse gas outpouring.In the decades to come, Asia--home to more than half the world's 63 billion people--will change from one climate extreme to another, with tired farmers battling droughts, floods, disease, food shortages and rising sea levels.\n\"It's not a pretty picture,\" said Steve Sawyer, climate policy adviser with Greenpeace in Amsterdam.Global warming and changes of weather patterns are already occurring and there is more than enough carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to drive climate change for decades to come.\nAlready, changes are being felt in Asia but worse is likely to come.Sawyer and top climate bodies say, and could lead to mass migration and widespread human disasters.According to predictions, icebergs will melt faster, some Pacific and Indian Ocean islands will have to evacuate or build sea defenses, storms will become stronger and insects and water-borne diseases will move into new areas as the world warms.\nAll this comes on top of rising populations and demand for food, water and other resources.Experts say environmental worsening such as deforestation and pollution will likely enlarge the results of climate change.\nIn what could be a sign of the future, Japan was hit by a record of 10 typhoons and tropical storms this year, while two - thirds of Bangladesh, parts of Nepal and large areas of northeastern India were flooded, affecting 50 million people, destroying livelihoods and making tens of thousands ill.\nThe year before, a winter cold strike and a summer heat wave killed more than 2,000 people in India."

      "I never got along with Dad. But when he was dying. I set off for Nebraska to be with him and my family. I stopped for the night at a hotel with a pool, hoping it would relax me.\nThe pool area was empty as I walked into the still water. A man in a bathing suit appeared. He sat on the edge of the pool with his legs moving up and down in the water. He had dark hair and deep brown eyes and smiled. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. When I told him about my father, he asked how we got along. I tried to change the subject, but then for some reason, I told him everything.\nFinally the man said, \"Even with all the trouble, remember, your father still loves you.\" All at once, warm and clear childhood memories came flooding back: Dad running alongside my wobbling bicycle, the proud hug he gave me at my high school graduation, his laugh when I caught him off guard with a tickle . \"Yes, I know he does, \" I heard myself say. And for the first time in years I believed it. The man left, leaving me alone with my comforting thoughts.\nBack in my room, as I went to bed, I decided it was time to forgive my father. Then I wished he'd forgive me too. The phone bell woke me up at 3 am. My sister's voice sent a shiver through me: Dad had just died. I had wanted to see him and make peace.

      "I stood at the wqindow and watched the neighborhood children flying their kites on the hill behind our house. Next to me, my four-year-old son, Michael, pressed his face against the glass. Then, looking up at me with pleading eyes, he again asked if he could have a kite.\n   Ever since he had first seen the children on the hill, Michael had been asking the same question, and had been given the same answer: \"Wait till you are a little older.\" Michael hid his face in my skirt, something he always did when he was going to cry and didn't want me to see.\n   I felt like crying myself. Because of my health I simply didn't have the strength or energy to fly a kite with Michael, and Michael was too young to fly a kite all by himself. My husband worked long, irregular  hours, and even so we kept going deeper in debt. As a result, a tension had grown between us.\n   Michael was the one spark of life left for me. As I put him into bed that evening, he said, \"Mummy, may I pray to God to send me a yellow kite?\"\n   \"Yes,\" I said. \"We will leave it up to him.\" I was tired of the whole thing and hoped that maybe this would make Michae stop talking about it. \n   The next morning I raised the shade in the kitchen, and stared at the sight that met my eyes--a string hanging down in front of the window. I ran out of the back door. There was a kite, a yellow one.\n   Michael clapped his hands and jumped up and down. \"Mummy, I knew God would answer my prayer!\" I didn't believed. We asked all over the neighborhood but twe never found the kite's former owner.\n   My depression left me, and as my health improved, so did my relationship with my husband. All I needed was comfort; no matter what it is, the kindness always exists in my heart."

      "WHAT can help you make a fortune in the future? Graduating from a top university might not be enough. A new study from the University of Essex in Britain has shown that the more friends you have in school, the more money you'll earn later.\nThe idea that popularity could have a serious influence on one's earning potential shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The researchers noted that if you want to get ahead in life, social skills and networking are easily as powerful as talent and hard work.\n\"If a person has lots of friends, it means that he or she has the ability to get along with others in all kinds of different situations,\" said Xu Yanchun, 17, from Nantou High School in Shenzhen, who totally agreed with the recent finding. \"Also, friends always help each other. They not only create wider social circles for you but lift your mood when you are occasionally in low spirits,\" said Xu. She believed that all this helps you \"earn a higher salary.\"\nMaybe that's why some people think the younger generations are in the age of Friendalholism  . A woman even complained that the networking website Facebook's 5,000-friend limit was too low for her large reserve of social contacts.\nBut what does a friend mean? Should friends be regarded as a form of currency?\n\"Call me uncool, but I think of a friend as an actual person with whom I have an actual history and whom I enjoy actually seeing. It seems, however, that this is no longer the definition of friend\", said Meghan Daum, who works with The Los Angeles Times in the US.\nDaum dislikes the idea that quantity _ quality in the age of Friendaholism. She thought the idea of friendship, at least among the growing population of Internet social networkers, was to get as many of not-really-friends as possible. For example, a friend might be someone you might know personally but who could just as easily be the friend of a friend of some other Facebook friend you don't actually know. Although she agreed that social ties grease   the wheels of life, she also warned. \"Too bad one thing money can't buy is a real friend.\""

      "All parents know that one of their most important tasks is to prepare their children for an independent life, but any parent can tell you that it's hard to let go of your children. That balance between keeping your children safe and allowing them to learn from their own mistakes can be heartbreaking. Years of experience means that parents often do know best, but on the other hand, the young, being less bound by tradition, are often more creative, more able to find new solutions to old problems. _ \nGood teachers make the growth of critical   thinking easier in their students, only to find that this can lead to a questioning of the teachers' basic beliefs. Schools encourage parents to become involved, but are often embarrassed when parents have reservations about some of the educational methods being used. Governments encourage unimportant groups to empower themselves in order to participate fully in the development process. And they are often surprised when the new leaders of these groups turn around and attack the policies of that same government. The rebellions  young and the newly unimportant groups are important in social development. They are not necessarily representatives of those they want to represent or not realistic in their demands, but their voices must be heard.\nGood parents know that just forbidding particular behaviors does not prevent their children from finding ways to engage in these forbidden activities. Indeed, sometimes the forbidden fruit is more inviting, just because it is not accepted by authority. Parents must work with their children to educate them on the facts, know as much as possible about he lives of their children, provide a good example, encourage more wholesome activities but also support their children when they don't follow what is expected of them. But the most important point is that they also need to learn how to let go."

      "Millions of kids in the United States attend some kind of camp each summer. Some go to sleep-away camp for weeks, while others attend day camp in their hometowns. There is one thing all those camps have in common, though. More than nine out of 10 kids said camp helped them make new friends and feel better about themselves.\n _ \nWhat else do kids get out of camp? Plenty!\nKids who want to be stars on the football field or basketball court have their choice of a variety of summer camps. Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes. Other summer sports camp opportunities are offered by professional teams or university athletic departments. Players and coaches usually lead those camps, teaching basic skills as well as teamwork and good sports behavior.\nOpen up to fun\nIt's easy to be yourself if you have something in common with your fellow campers, even when that something is a disease.\nA journal entry by one camper describes the camp's high ropes course as a symbol of everyone there and the challenges they face. \"Climbing it and going through that struggle to get up and push yourself is like getting through the sickness we all were faced with at some point,\" she writes. There is another reward that comes once climbers reach the top of the ropes course and hear the words \"good job\" from their fellow campers. It is, \"in a way, coming close to being cured. Even if we aren't, it felt like it,\" the camper says.\nHealthy benefits\nThere are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. \"I had the most fun ever!\" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much. She stayed for eight weeks instead of the four weeks she'd originally agreed to. \"This camp has helped improve my self-respect 100 percent, and I'm no longer self-conscious.\""

      "The high-protein, low-carbohydrate  diets many people turn to for weight loss might have potentially harmful long-term effects on the  _ , a small study indicates.\n       In the study, UK researchers found that a protein-heavy, low-carb diet created certain changes in the colon that could contribute to colon cancer risk. The study itself does not show whether high-protein diets really raise the risk of any colon diseases, but the findings raise that possibility.\n       Diets  ly high in protein and lower in carbs have been shown to help heavy people lose weight. \"People should not be discouraged from losing weight,\" Dr Flint said. However, he added, they should make sure that any weight loss plan includes adequate amounts of fiber and a high protein intake over months to years might have ill effects on the colon.\n       The findings are based on 17 overweight men who followed three short-term diets: a one-week menu plan to keep their weight; a four-week high-protein diet with reasonable amounts of carbohydrates; and a four-week high-protein diet low in carbs.\n       On average, the study found when the men were on the high-protein diets, they had higher levels of substances known as N-nitroso compounds  and other metabolites  that have been linked to cancer. And when they were on the high-protein, low-carb diet, they had lowered amounts of fiber-originated compounds thought to be protective against cancer.\n       Exactly what those changes might mean for a person's health is not clear, but Flint said that the findings suggest that people should be cautious about consuming too much protein and too little fiber over a long period. In general, experts recommend that adults get about 28 grams of fiber per day--though it's not known whether that's enough for someone on a high-protein weight-loss diet."

      "If you are planning to learn a foreign language, here are some suggestions about language learning. I hope these suggestions can help improve your learning of a foreign language\nTry to set aside some time every day for your study when your brain is at the most time for receiving information. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than for 3 hours once a week. If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about. What matters is getting your message across, not whether you use all the right words, tenses, cases, etc. If you cannot think of the exact words, try using other ones."

      "A water bearer in India had two large pots, each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a crack  in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full.\nThis went on daily. The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishment. Of course, the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream.\n\"I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologise to you.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the bearer. \"What are you ashamed of?\"\n\"I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back. And you do no get full value for your efforts\" the pot explained.\nThe water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, \"As we return to the master's house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.\"\nAs they went up the hill, the cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it a little.\nThe bearer said, \"Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side?\" That is because I have known about you, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walked back from the stream, you have watered them.

The automaker has sold 421 limousines  to China in 2009, and the goal for 2010 is 777, the release said."

      "I've always known that dogs are clever, but even I was surprised when I heard about a dog called Red, at the Battersea Dog's Home in London.\nThe home has been caring for lost and unwanted animals for over 140 years. Recently, the staff there got a shock when they came to work in the morning. They found that some of the dogs had got out of their kennels  during the night, opened cupboards and taken out food and toys. And it happened again and again. The manager described how as many as nine dogs were escaping every night. \" When we came in, dogs were running around having fun and causing a lot of mess. \"\nSomeone or something was unlocking   the kennels during the night. The manager decided to put in cameras to record how the dogs were getting out.\nWhen she and her staff played back the recording, they saw Red, a three-year-old dog, put his nose through the bars of his kennel and use his teeth to press the button  that opened his door. That was clever enough, but Red did more: he unlocked the kennels next to his and let the dogs out too. The group broke into cupboards and stole dog biscuits and toys to play with.\nThe manager said, \" It's surprising that Red _ how to open his own kennel and let all his friends out.\" I suppose, Red didn't like to party alone.\nThe story has a happy ending: after Red was shown on TV, several people came and offered to give him a new home as a family pet."

      "Begin doing the work you love as soon as possible, even if you don't get paid for it, or if you can only work at it part-time. Albert Einstein was unable to get a job as a physics professor. He could have said to himself, \"Well, I just don't have the work relative to physics. I should give up on it and settle for something else.\" Instead, he wrote the two most famous papers when he was employed as a patent  clerk. After their publication, there was not a major university in the world that would not have been glad to have him on their staff.\nIf you want to work as an artist and you are making a living as a waiter, don't think of yourself as a waiter who hopes one day to become an artist. That puts the work you love somewhere off in the distant future. Rather, think of yourself as an artist, supporting yourself by waiter tables--and paint, or draw as much as you can. It is possible to earn a living wage as a waiter working 24 hours a week. That leaves plenty of time to devote to training or developing your craft in the off hours.\nWhile seeking the work you love, it helps to expand your awareness  into the universe of all possibilities. You don't want to be limited to the ideas of what you should do or what you have done before. Having opened to all possibilities, you can make a final decision and select the work you love as your own.\nDoing the work you love requires that you be equally comfortable with the imaginative and the practical.

      "If I were writing a history of my family, some of the darkest moments recorded would be those surrounding Christmas trees. One would certainly think otherwise; selecting and putting up our trees have always been filled with risk.\nFor example, one afternoon dangerously close to Christmas Eve _ , a glorious tree that was so full and tall that we could hardly get it into the house. Once we did, my father immediately realized that we would have to hire a carpenter to build a stand for it.\nAnother December, perhaps the very next one, we bought a tree earlier than we ever had before. We were happy with its shape and delighted that its size was manageable. We easily placed it in a stand, decorated it from top to bottom, and then self-satisfiedly sat back by the fire in its soft light.\nTwo or three days passed and the truth could not be hidden; we had bought a tree cut so long ago that its needles were coming off. There was nothing to do but undecorated it, take it down, and begin tree shopping again.\nOur most recent Christmas tree offered still another difficult task. When we brought it home, once again it seemed larger than it was in the great outdoors. To complicate matters, we had bought a new stand, one whose nuts and bolts worked more mysteriously than those of our old stands. I persuaded two young neighbors to stop playing basketball and to help us get the tree into the house and set it correctly in the stand. Unfortunately, no one noticed the mud on our helpers' shoes, so only after removing several reddish brown sports from the carpet were we able to discuss the question of where the lights and ornaments were stored. Perhaps those who cut their own trees have tales more painful than these. I don't care to hear them, as my family's experiences are enough to cause me to make the following suggestion: \"Let's forget the tree next Christmas. Let's simply hang some flowers on the front door and over the mirror in the hall.\""

      "Cell phones with cameras are really a popular way to capture a moment in time, but some \"clever\" students found another use--capturing tests as a way to cheat.\nThe Magnolia Independent School District in Montgomery County has added camera phones to a list of electronic devices   students are _ at school.\nSchool officials said the move was made as a preventative measure to stop potential   test cheaters, since students could use the phones to snap pictures of test questions. Another concern was that students might take inappropriate   pictures of classmates to later share or post on a website. Cell phones without cameras are allowed on campus, but must be turned off. Camera cell phones will be taken away from students if found on campus, and disciplinary action will be taken, officials said.\nSome students were unhappy to hear about the ban. \"I'd be lost without my phone,\" said Kendall Paul, a Magnolia High School student. \"All my numbers are in it. I've never used it to cheat and I don't know anyone who has at our school, so I think it's kind of stupid. \" But other students said they saw _ all the time at their school.\n\"You would take a picture of the test and then send it to the next person taking the test,\" said Melissa Sparks, a student.\n\"They would send the question and the answer, or just the number of the question and the answer. It's quicker that way,\" another student said.\nParents often provide their children with cell phones for use in emergencies and to keep in better touch with them. \"My Mom wants me to have my phone with me all the time for emergency purpose.

      "\"Image is everything.\" An entire industry has been built upon the assumption that image is everything, but when it comes down to it, an appealing image is not enough.If there is no substance  behind the image, the product, service or person will fail eventually.\nFirst of all, one should consider how important image is in the selling of products and services.Advertising agencies have raised the art of creating an image to a state of near perfection.Public concept of that product or service is certainly managed by the images created by the advertising agencies.But if the product or service does not live up to the image that was created, the customer will be very dissatisfied and possibly ask for their money back.For example, the Arthur Andersen accounting firm had spent decades building up an image of trustworthiness.But the recent scandal   showed that behind that image, it cheated in business practices.Despite the previous positive image, the firm is being accused of criminal actions and it will probably not survive as a business unit.Although the image had been nearly perfect, the reality behind the image has led to the downfall of the world famous accounting firm.\nSimilarly, personal advisers can build up a public image for politicians and movie stars.Putting out positive news releases, making sure that only the best photographs are published, and ensuring that the person is seen in all the right places can build up a very positive image in the view of the general commons.But once again, history is filled with examples of both politicians and movie stars that fell from grace like the story of the Hollywood actor giving in to the pressures of fame and fortune.With people, just as with products and services, image is certainly important, but without positive substance behind the image, failure is close.\nTo summarize, it is clear that an appealing image is extremely important to success, whether that image is related to selling a product or service or to the \"selling\" of a person.But image is only half of the equation.What lies behind that image is every bit as important as the image itself ---- the person or product must deliver on that image or there is little chance for long-term success."

      "Expensive perfumes   come in tiny bottles, but many hide a whale-sized secret.\nTo perfect a particular smell, perfume-makers often use an ingredient that comes from sperm whales, called ambergris  . But using ambergris, which helps a perfume last longer, is strongly opposed by many people who think it is wrong to kill whales just so we can smell sweet. Joerg Bohlmann is neither a perfumer nor a whale expert. He's a plant biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But his discovery of a new plant gene   might push whales out of the perfume business.\nThe gene comes from fir trees, found throughout North America and commonly used as Christmas trees. The trees produce a chemical that can be used in perfume in place of ambergris-but _ . \"There's a problem that many people wouldn't consider. In the tree, the chemical is mixed with many others. That makes separation a challenge,\" Bohlmann says. \"lt's like trying to isolate sugar from a biscuit. \"\nThis is where science becomes useful. When Bohlmann learned that fir trees produce the ambergris-like chemical, he decided to use his gene know-how to find the instructions for how to make the ambergris-substitute.\nBohlmann found that gene and took it out of the tree cells. Then he did something that might sound strange to someone who doesn't work in genetics: Bohlmann put the gene from the tree into yeast   cells.\nYeast may sound familiar because it's used to make things like bread, wine and beer. Biologists like to work with yeast because it easily adopts new genes and changes its features and behaviour. When Bohlmann put the fir tree gene into the yeast, the yeast started making the same chemical that had been produced by the tree.\nPerfumers pay big money for ambergris because it is a fixative, which means it holds a smell in place on a person's body.\n\"Cheap perfumes smell good in the first hour or so and then everything is gone,\" explains Bohlmann. \"But expensive perfumes are much more stable.  Their smell lasts much longer, for hours or even a day after you apply them. \"\nThe new chemical, made from the tree genes, can be used as a fixative, too. And using yeast to make it is far cheaper than acquiring ambergris.\nBohlmann admits he never thought he'd get into the perfume business. But now, he says, producers have been calling to find out how to use his technology in new perfumes."

      "BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's economic planning agency Thursday announced a rise in minimum rice purchase prices this year to encourage farmers to grow more grain.\nA statement on the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) website said the government would continue the policy of minimum purchase prices in major rice-growing regions in 2011. The rises in the minimum rice purchase price had been approved by the State Council, China's Cabinet, said the statement.\nThe purchase prices for japonica rice will rise 21.9 percent to 128 yuan (19.4 U.S. dollars) per 50 kilograms, while prices for early and middle-late rice will increase 9.7 percent and 10.3 percent to 102 yuan and 107 yuan per 50 kg respectively.\nRice and wheat are two major grain crops in China.\nThe State Council pledged Wednesday to step up efforts to boost grain production as drought continues to wreak havoc in north China's wheat growing regions.\nChina's main wheat-growing regions, including Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and Jiangsu provinces, have been plagued by drought since October last year.\nDrought has affected about 7.73 million hectares, or 42.4 percent, of the total winter wheat crop area in the country's eight key producing provinces, the Ministry of Agriculture said Wednesday.\nChina's grain output rose 2.9 percent last year to 546.41 million tons, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth."

You can't find a parking place, and the traffic jams are terrible.\" Everyone is worried about crime, \"The city is full of criminals-it's toodangerous.\"\nFor them, the rural  life is a cure for all problems, green grass, flowers, swimming pools, barbecues, and so on.

Also, I can get everywhere by bus; if there is a traffic jam, I can walk home.

      "One year, my school report made my parents angry. On Christmas Eve, all the presents were stolen, along with our TV. My parents told me that there were no presents because Santa was very angry with my behavior over the past year. The next year on Christmas Eve I slept downstairs with a plastic sword waiting for Santa to make sure that he didn't steal the new TV. The next morning, when I woke up, I saw Santa standing there. As soon as I saw that there were no presents, I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him, shouting angrily: \"THIEF! THIEF!\"\nJack\nWhen I was young, we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree. My mom never really liked the location, so one year she moved the tree into another room. I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house. I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the \"bad\" list and would not give me any gifts because he couldn't find the tree. I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree. They said things like: \"Tree this way\" or \"Santa, put the gifts over here.\" When my big brother saw them he began to laugh his head off.\nLucy\nDoes everyone remember going to the mall and sitting on Santa's lap to have his picture taken at Christmas time?\nWell, I used to think that if I did that, Santa would get mad bcause he would have to go all around the world and give every kid the chance to have his picture taken with him. Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired.

      "Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, especially because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \"Car of the Future\". They featured unconventional things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully.\nBut guess what? All of these things are likely to change in the not-so-distant future. It may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things.\nAirbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed crashes, they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer.\nBetter than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place? Future cars may be able to remove many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, and tailgating  . Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle . \nScientists are now working on a system that can brake, accelerate and steer a vehicle down a highway on its own.

      "As the pace of life continues to increase, we are fast losing the art of relaxation. Once you are in the habit of rushing through life,being on the go from morning till night,it is hard to slow down. But relaxation is necessary for a healthy mind and body.\nStress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. In fact,it is not the bad thing it is often supposed to be. A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life. It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health.\nThe amount of stress a person can bear depends very much on the individual. Some people are not afraid of stressand such characters are obviously important material for managerial responsibilities. Others lose heart at the first signs of unusual difficulties. When exposed to stressin whatever formwe react both chemically and physically. In fact we make choices between \"fight\" and \"flight\" and in more ancient days the choice made the difference between life and death. The crises  we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response. It is when _ lasts long,through continued exposure to stressthat health becomes endangered. Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Since we cannot remove stress from our lives(it would be unwise to do so even if we could),we need to find ways to deal with it."

      "One year our family decided to have a special celebration of Mother's Day, as a token of appreciations for all the sacrifices that Mother had made for us. After breakfast we had arranged, as a surprise, to hire a car and take her for a beautiful drive in the country. Mother was rarely able to have a treat like that, because she was busy in the house nearly all the time.\nBut on the very morning of the day, we changed the plan a little, because it occurred to Father that it would be even better to take Mother fishing. As the car was hired and paid for, we might as well use it to drive up into the hills where the streams are. As Father said, if you just go driving without object, you have a sense of aimlessness, but if you are going to fish there is a definite purpose that heightens the enjoyment.\nSo we all felt it would be nicer for Mother to have a definite purpose . Father had just got a fishing rod the day before, which he said mother could use if she wanted to. Only Mother said she would much rather watch him fish than try to fish herself.\nSo we got her to make up a sandwich lunch in case we got hungry, though we were to come home again to a big festive dinner.\nWell, when the car came to the door, it turned out that there was not as much space in it as we had supposed. It was plain that we couldn't all get in.\nFather said that he could just stay home and put in the time working in the garden. He said that there was a lot of rough dirty work that he could do, like digging a trench for the garbage, which would save hiring a man, and so he said that he'd stay home; he said that we were not to let the fact that he had not had a real holiday for three years stand in our way. He wanted us to go right ahead and not to mind him.\nBut of course we all felt that it would never do to let Father stay home, especially as we knew he would make trouble if he did. The two girls, Anne and Mary, would have stayed and helped the maid get dinner, only it seemed such a pity,for the two girls were eager to show their new hats on a lovely day like this. But they said that Mother had only to say the word and they'd gladly stay home and work. Will and I would have dropped out, but unfortunately we wouldn't have been any use in preparing the dinner."

      "The discovery of an ancient giant panda skull has confirmed its bamboo diet dates back more than 2 million years and may have played a key part in its survival.[:\nA Chinese-US research team reports its results today following studies on a fossil skull found in south China's Cuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 2001.\nThe six fossils unearthed in Jinyin Cave are dated between 2.4 and 2 million years ago, according to the report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an influential US journal.\nJin Changzhu, of the chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and lead author of the paper, said the smaller fossil skull indicates the giant pandas were about a third smaller than today's pandas.\nResearchers knew the panda reached its maximum size about 500,000 years ago, when it peaked ,and then gradually became smaller.\nJin, a paleontologist   at the Institute of Vertebrate paleontology and Paleoanthropology   attached to the CAS, said the size _ was a basic rule of evolution.\n\"A species tends to grow bigger when it reaches the peak of its population , but becomes smaller when numbers decline,\" he said.\nThe dental remains of the skull, which is the oldest giant panda skull ever found, are similar to today's pandas, indicating the type of teeth that could munch  mountains of bamboo. A panda can eat up to 40kg of bamboo per day.\nPaleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon, the US co-author at the University of lowa, said the panda's focus on bamboo could have helped it survive all these years.\n\"Once an animal begins to rely on a common and stable food source, such as bamboo, it tends to evolve a larger body size,\" he said. \"As individuals of the evolving species grow bigger, they have a better chance not to be eaten by predators   due to their larger body size.\""

      "Are you forty years old and fat? Do you wear fine clothes? Do you look rich? If so, be careful. There is a pickpocket looking for you. World travelers, away from home and usually carrying much money, are often troubled by pickpockets in foreign countries, but they should remember that there are pickpockets in their own country, too.\n              A typical pickpocket is under forty years of age, usually a male. He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm. He has learned his job from another pickpocket, and he repays his \"teacher\" by giving him a percentage of the money or things which he steals.\n              The skilled pickpocket always operates in crowded places. Very well-dressed men and slightly drunken men are the favorite objects of the pickpocket.\n              An average-sized department store hires about six or seven full-time detectives. These men and women are constantly looking for pickpockets quickly. But a good pickpocket knows these things and is very careful. He is especially busy on buses, trains and subways between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. when there are many shoppers with much money to spend. He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.\n              Pickpocketing and stealing from a shop together represent about 75% of daytime little crimes in America. The sentence for these crimes is usually from three to five years in prison. After finishing their sentence, pickpockets and thieves seldom reform; they usually advance to more serious crimes."

      "This sense of total discomfort that you're both feeling is pretty normal. And I don't say that to in any way reduce your problems. I just don't want you to think that you're the one person in the world who's stuck with a neurotic   mom. Think about it: for most of the past 14 years, you have depended on your mother for every little thing you've ever needed. Now suddenly you're putting up all sorts of boundaries because you're growing out of being that little kid who needed her for everything, and it's hurting her feelings. What we need here is a little understanding and some new rules to take into account the changes you're going through. You can't just stop sharing things with your mom. It's mean. \nSo why not make a point of telling her some things about what's going on with you every day? She wants to feel that she's still a part of your life. And after consistently doing this for about a month, why don't you tell her where you'd like a little privacy  -- maybe there are certain things you don't want her to always ask about? Promise her that whenever there's an update on those topics, you will completely let her know. And follow up on it!\nThe bottom line is that you guys need to build a new relationship based on the young woman. The only way to do this is to work through some really uncomfortable moments and big fights and then come up with a solution, which is what you're doing now. So don't worry -- it's all going to be okay. But it will take some work, honesty and communication to get there. \nHaving a good relationship with your mom is a really important thing. She's the one person who will always be on your side."

What in the world will inventors dream up next?\nSuperhero Suit\nHave you ever dreamed of becoming a superhero? Dream no more. There's a real Iron Man suit, XOS 2, which instantly transforms the person wearing it. The suit provides the power to lift 200 pounds with ease and break slabs of wood with a single karate chop. It was designed to help the military with heavy lifting. One person in the suit could do the work of three soldiers.\nUp, Up and Away!\nIt took him 30 years to develop it, and now Glen Martin's invention is ready to take off. The Martin Jetpack allows its operator to fly 8,000 feet into the air. Unfortunately, you can't soar through the skies too long. The jetpack holds only 30 minutes' worth of fuel. The aircraft will sell for $100,000.\nHardworking Robot\nThe EMIEW2 robot is the perfect office helper. Need a document delivered? No problem! It can also guide visitors to their destinations. The three-foot-tall robot can identify different human voices and respond to commands. One day, it may serve as a receptionist or a security guard.\nGreen Machine\nSay goodbye to gasoline! The AirPod car runs on air power. That means this car won't pollute the environment. A high-pressure air tank can fill the car in minutes. The three-wheeler can travel about 130 miles between fill-ups.\nBeef Power\nAll aboard the beef train! Amtrak's Heartland Flyer runs partly on fuel that is made from cow fat. The goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 10%. The train travels between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Fort Worth, Texas.\nRobo-Guard\nEMILY is a robotic, four-foot-long buoy  . She can swim through riptides   at up to 24 miles per hour. Her inventor, Tony Mulligan, says that's 15 times as fast as human lifeguards! EMILY is powered by a tiny electric pump and operated by remote control."

      "It's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s' and it's designed to give all children in Finland, no matter what background they're from, an equal start in life.\nThe maternity  package -- a gift from the government -- is available to all expectant    mothers. It contains bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products for the baby as well as nappies, bedding and a small mattress.\nWith the mattress at the bottom, the box becomes a baby's first bed. Many children, from all social backgrounds, have their first naps within the safety of the box's four cardboard walls.\nThe tradition dates back to 1938. At first, the scheme was only available to families on low incomes, but that changed in 1949. In the 1930s Finland was a poor country and the infant death rate was high -- 65 out of 1,000 babies died. But the figure decreased rapidly in the decades that followed. Over 75 years, the box has been an established part of the Finnish rite  of a passage to motherhood, uniting generations of women.\nReija Klemetti, a 49-year-old woman from Helsinki, remembers going to the post office to    receive a box for one of her children. \"My partner Milla and I were living in London when we had our first child, Jasper, so we weren't eligible   for a free box. But Milla's parents didn't want us to miss out, so they bought one and put it in the post office. We couldn't wait to open the box. There were all the clothes I had expected, with the addition of a snowsuit for Finland's cold winter.\"\n\"We now live in Helsinki and have just had our second child, Annika. She did get a free box, from the Finnish government. This felt to me like evidence that someone cared -- someone wanted our baby to have a good start in life,\" Reija Klemetti said."

      "When someone says , \"Well , I guess I'll have to go to face the music,\" It doesn't mean he is planning to go to a concert . It is something far less pleasant , like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that , and why you did not do this or that . Sour  music , indeed , but it has to be faced .\nThe phrase \"to face the music\" is familiar to every American , young and old . It is at least 100 years old . Where did the expression come from ?\nThe first information comes from the American writer James Fenimore Cooper . He said--in 1851--that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings  to go on stage . After they got their clue to go on , they often said , \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did --face the orchestra which was just below the stage .\nAn actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out .\nSo, \"to face the music\" came to mean : having to go through something , no matter how unpleasant the experience might be , because you knew you had no choice .\nThe other explanation comes from the army . Men had to face inspection by their leader . The soldiers worried about how well they looked . Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection ? Still , the men had to go out , and face the music of the band , as well as the inspection . What else could they do ?"

      "Memory, they say, is a matter of practice and exercise. If you have the wish and really make a conscious   effort, then you can quite easily improve your ability to remember things. But even if you are successful, there are times when your memory seems to play tricks on you.\nSometimes you remember things that really did not happen. One morning last week, for example, I got up and found that I had left the front door unlocked all night, yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully the night before.\nMemory \"tricks\" work the other way as well. Once in a while you remember not doing something and then find out that you did. One day last month, for example,I was sitting in a barbershop   waiting for my turn to get a haircut, and suddenly I realized that I had got a haircut two days before at the barbershop across the street from my office.\nWe always seem to find something funny and interesting in incidents  caused by people's forgetfulness or absent-mindedness. Stories about absent-minded professors have been told for years. Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny. There are times when \"tricks\" of our memory can cause us great trouble."

      "Are you preparing for a big test? If so, you may want to play some basketball in between hitting the books. Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels , including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says, \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can really cause physical changes in the brain.\"\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.\nOlder people can beef up their brains as well. Scientists from 11 universities studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants  , exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions, such as with yoga or tai-chi, helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as three hours of exercise a week."

      "Cheektowage Central Middle School can be a lot of fun. It has game nights and student dances, after-school activities, and sports teams. However, students at the school must earn the right to join in the fun. If they don't do their homework, participate in class, and behave at all times, they're banned  from participating in after-school activities.\nStudents and parents say the threat of being excluded  appears to be working. Kenny T. of Reno, Nev., says it taught him that actions have consequences: \"I learned that I need to be balanced in both my work and athletics to be rewarded for working hard.\" Parent Sondra LaMacchia told The New York Times that her 14-year-old daughter is learning responsibility at Cheektowaga Central. The teen used to perform poorly in her studies, but then she was banned from a school dance. The message got through loud and clear. \"It's nobody's fault but hers,\" LaMacchia said.\nAlthough exclusion may help teach responsibility, some psychologists say it can also be threatening, especially for students who often cause, or may cause, trouble in school. They might become more aggressive and antisocial, which is exactly what schools like Cheektowaga Central want to prevent.\nShould schools exclude students from activities to get them to behave? I believe teens need school activities and that inclusion can be the answer. For some troubled students, activities can be their motivation to stay in school. \"Activities such as sports may be the only thing keeping certain students in school,\" says Duace Wood, a teacher at Mohonasen High School in Rotterdam, N.Y. Getting involved in after-class activities keeps troublesome students in class. Even if they don't do as well as their classmates, they are still learning. The more time they spend at school, the less time they have to even think about starting trouble. Teams also provide support and role models, and they help build the confidence that students need to succeed. If students who don't behave are banned from activities, they might give up on school altogether."

      "Last Sunday I made a visit to some new neighbors down the block. No specific purpose in mind, just an opportunity to sit at the kitchen table, have some tea and chat. As I did so, it occurred to me how rare the Sunday visit has become.\nWhen I was a kid in the New Jersey of the 1960s, Sunday visits were routine. Most stores were closed and almost nobody worked. My family normally traveled eight city blocks to the home of my grandmother, where adults would sit on the front porch and chat while we children played hide-and-seek.\nThe Sunday visit was something to desire strongly. It was the repetition to church, our reward for and hour of devotion, and opportunity to take advantage of the fact that Dad was not at work, we were not in school, and there were no chores that couldn't wait until Monday. Sunday was, indeed, which means that there was one day when everyone seemed to have time for everybody else.\nSunday as a day of rest is, or was, so deeply rooted in the culture that it's surprising to consider that, in a short span of time, it has almost entirely lost this association.1In my childhood, it was assumed that everyone would either be home or visit someone else's home on Sunday. But now the question is, \"What do you plan to Do this Sunday?\" The answer can range from going to the mall to participating in a road to jetting to Montreal for lunch. _ \nI suppose I should be grateful to live in Maine, a state of small towns, abundant land tight relationships. Even though folks work as hard here as they do anywhere else, the state's powerfully rural cast still harbors at least remnants of the ethic of yesterday's America, where people had to depend on one another in the face of economic vagaries and a challenging environment.2"

      "There are many American expressions about insects--- like bees, for example. Bees are known as very hard workers. They appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives  . So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house. In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn   .\nHere is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the 1920s. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee's knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!\nIf your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet  . If  someone asks you a personal question, you might say \"that is none of your beeswax\". This means none of your business.\nSpeaking of personal questions, there is an expression when their children ask, \"Where do babies come from?\" Parents who discuss sex and reproduction   say this is talking about the birds and bees.\nButterflies are beautiful insects, but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach. That means to be nervous about having to do something, like speaking in front of a crowd. You would also not want to have ants in your trousers. That is, to be unable to sit still."

      "Today, roller skating is easy and fun. But a long time ago, it wasn't easy at all. Before 1750, the idea of skating didn't exist. That changed because of a man named Joseph Merlin. Merlin's work was making musical instruments. In his spare time he liked to play the violin. Joseph Merlin was a man of ideas and dreams. People called him a dreamer.\nOne day Merlin received an invitation to attend a fancy dress ball. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think how to make a grand entrance at the party. He had an idea. He thought he would get a lot of attention if he could skate into the room.\nMerlin tried different ways to make himself roll. Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skates. Merlin was very proud of his invention and dreamed of arriving at the party on wheels while playing the violin.\nOn the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room playing his violin. Everyone was astonished to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skates. He rolled on and on. Suddenly, he ran into a huge mirror that was hanging on the wall. Down fell the mirror, breaking to pieces. Nobody forgot Merlin's grand entrance for a long time!"

      "There was once a lonely girl who longed so much for love.One day while she was walking in the woods she found two starving songbirds.She took them home and put them in a small cage,caring them with love.Luckily,the birds grew strong little by little.Every morning they greeted her with a wonderful song.The girl felt great love for the birds.\nOne day the girl left the door to the cage open accidentally.The larger and stronger of the two birds flew from the cage.The girl was so frightened that he would fly away so as he flew close,she grasped him wildly.Her heart felt glad at her success in capturing him.Suddenly,she felt the bird go limp,so she opened her hand and stared in horror at the dead bird.It was her desperate love that had killed him.\nShe noticed the other bird moving back and forth on the edge of the cage.She could feel his strong desire-needing to fly into the clear,blue sky.Unwillingly,she lifted him from the cage and _ him softly into the air.The lucky bird circled once,twice,three times.\nThe girl watched delightedly at the bird.Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss.What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily.Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder.It sang the sweetest tune that she had ever heard.\nRemember,the fastest way to lose love is to hold on it too tight;the best way to keep love is to give it wings!"

      "Now scientists have discovered the first evidence that the animals actually behave like their masters. Just like children, they adopt a \"look and learn\" approach which means they can mimic   human's actions when going about their tasks.\nBiologists and psychologists at the universities of Vienna and Oxford designed an experiment to test the theory that dogs do have the ability to copy what they see, using a simple wooden box. In the study, ten owners showed their dogs how to open the wooden box, sometimes using their heads to push a handle and sometimes using their hands.\nIn the first part of the test, five dogs were rewarded with a piece of sausage for copying their owners' actions. The other five were rewarded with food for not copying, and using other methods. With each dog the experiment was repeated hundreds of times, and the time taken for a dog to get it \"right\" on 85 percent of attempts (17 goes out of 20) was recorded. The dogs encouraged to mirror their owners reached this point almost three times sooner on average than those rewarded for not copying them. In the second part of the test, all the dogs were only rewarded for copying the method their owners used. The five dogs previously rewarded for copying their owners reached the 85 percent mark more than twice as the other five.\nIn a paper published in Proceeding of the Royal Society, _ concluded, \"Like humans, dogs can't help imitating actions they see.\" Going further, they said, \"The results suggest the imitative   behavior of dogs is shaped more by their developmental interactions with humans than by their evolutionary   history of domestication  .\"\nCaroline Kisko, from the Kennel club, said, \"A dog's behavior is influenced much like that of a child learning right from wrong and adopting similar patterns of behavior. We hope that owners understand the importance of their actions and use this knowledge to set good examples and therefore positively influence the behavior of their pets.\""

      "Alfred Nobel, the great Swedish inventor and industrialist, was born in Stockholm on October 21, 1833, but moved to Russia with his parents in 1842, where his father, Immanuel, made a strong position for himself in the engineering industry.\nImmanuel Nobel invented landmine and made a lot of money from the government during the Crimean War, but went bankrupt soon after. Then, the family returned to Sweden in 1859, where Alfred began his own study of explosives in his father's lab. He had never been to school or university but had taught himself, and by the time he was twenty, he became a skillful chemist and excellent linguist, speaking Swedish, Russian, German, French and English. He built up over 80 companies in 20 different countries.\nHe was always searching for a meaning to life. He spent much time and money working on how to end the wars, and the peace between nations, until his death in Italy in 1896. His famous last will, in which he left money to provide prizes for outstanding work in physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, literature and peace, is a memorial to his interests and ideas.

      "I lost my sight when I was four years old by falling off a box car in a freight yard in Atlantic City and landing on my head. Now I am thirty two. I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity  can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn't been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don't mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.\nLife, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. The adjustment is never easy. I was totally confused and afraid. But I was lucky. My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.\nThe hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance  that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that somewhere in the sweeping, intricate  pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit.\nIt took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the simplest things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. \"I can't use this.\" I said. \"Take it with you,\" he urged me, \"and roll it around.\" The words stuck in my head. \"Roll it around! \"By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia's Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.\nAll my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress."

      "I was driving home the other day on a sunny afternoon. I had a smile on my face as I sang along to the songs on the radio. It was such a beautiful day that I felt full of happiness. My good mood ended, however, when the radio station took a news break between songs. Then suddenly I found myself listening to yet another story of a rich famous man who had broken the law. I shook my head as I came to a red traffic light.\nAs I pulled to a stop I noticed four leatherjacketed bikers. They were standing in the middle of the road with two on either side of the light. They looked rough and dangerous, but as I got closer I noticed each one was holding their helmet in their hands. I rolled down my window as one approached my car. \"We are the Brother of the Wheel,\" he said. \"We are collecting money for Christmas Toy Drive for needy children.\" As I pulled a dollar out of my wallet I looked past his beard and into his eyes. They shined with goodness and kindness that came right from his soul. I dropped the money in his helmet and waved to the other bikers as I drove off. My good mood had returned. My faith in mankind had been _ . And I remembered once again never to judge people by their appearance.\nOur society often judges books by their covers but God reads what is written in our hearts and souls. Perhaps one day we will all learn to see the world through the same eyes. Perhaps one day we will realize that looks matter little and actions matter much."

      "My name is Pablo. I think I'm a lucky guy. I have a good family, and we live in a nice neighborhood in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. People travel here from many countries for their vacations. We have beautiful beaches, hotels, restaurants, shopping and sports.\nHowever, in my beautiful hometown, there are also very poor neighborhoods. These areas are crowded and have a lot of crime. Life is terrible for many of the children in these areas. Some don't really have a childhood because they're homeless and live on the streets. They don't have education. They don't have enough food. Many use drugs or have diseases or mental problems.\nLast year, I came back to Puerto Vallarta from my university in Mexico City. I spent one year as a volunteer with an organization called Outreach International. They have several programs. I volunteered for one program to help street children.\nI worked in a home for street children (all boys, at this one). At this home, the boys have a place to sleep and three meals daily. The home keeps the boys off the streets. It shows them another way of life. As a volunteer, I helped to prepare meals. I taught games---such as basketball, football and art. I helped the kids with their homework. These kids can be fun. They have a lot of energy, but they're also really tough. Their hardships on the streets make them strong and not always \"sweet little children.\"\nAt this boys' home, I met two other volunteers---Brian from Canada and Greg from Australia. In many ways, we were very similar. We were the same age, came from good homes and had a good education. They were both college students, like me. We became very good friends. Now, we email each other.\nIt was the best---and most difficult---year of my life. I learned a lot that year."

      "Filmmakers Michele dive into an eerie   world. The usually colorful corals are a ghostly white. Most of the fish, crabs, and other animals have disappeared. The reef is sick and dying.\nCoral reefs are often called \"the rainforests of the sea\" because of their abundance of life forms. A great diversity of animals finds food and shelter in every crack and crevice.\nToday's reefs are about 10,000 years old. Found in sunny, shallow water in warm seas all over the world, reefs are made up of the hard shells of millions of corals. As corals live and die, they create a giant, rocky honeycomb. Only a thin top layer is living coral.\nA reef grows only about as fast as your fingernails--three-quarters of an inch a year. But coral reefs are huge, and in time a healthy reef can be thousands of miles long.\nMillions of people around the world rely on reef fish and other animals for food. And reefs provide protection from storms at sea. Without thousands of miles of reefs surrounding coastal areas, many beaches and even whole islands could be destroyed by the pounding of powerful ocean waves.\n\"Let's say a grazing animal like the parrot fish is overfished,\" Michele explains. \"Without them, the kind of algae   that the fish feed on could grow like weeds and take over the reef. The competition for space and sunlight could then starve the coral.\"\nNearly 27 percent of the world's coral reefs have been lost or damaged. But there is hope. Many reefs around the world--including the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the reefs off the Florida Keys in the United States--are now protected areas where scientists study how to keep reefs healthy. They determine how many and which kinds of fish can be taken for food without hurting the reef's delicate balance.\nThere is hope, too, that people will learn to be good partners to the reefs. \"We want our film to inspire people to help coral reefs,\" says Michele. \"For me, even though I may not go back to the South Pacific, just knowing the reefs are there and thriving brings a sense of contentment   to my spirit.\""

      "The twentieth century saw greater changes than any century before. Changes for the better, changes for the worse, changes that brought a lot of benefits to human beings, changes that put man in danger. Many things caused the changes, but, in my opinion, the most important was the progress in science.\nScientific research in physics and biology has vastly broadened our views. It has given us a deeper knowledge of the structure of matter and of the universe. It has brought us a better understanding of the nature of life and of its continuous development. Technology in the application of science has made big advances that have benefited us in nearly every part of life.\nThe continuation of such activities in the twenty-first century will result in even greater advantages to human beings; in pure science--a wider and deeper knowledge in all fields of learning; in applied science--- a more reasonable sharing of material benefits, and better protection of the environment.\nSadly, however, there is another side to the picture. The creativity of science has been employed in doing damage to mankind. The application of science and technology to the development and production of weapons of mass destruction has created a real danger to the continued existence of the human race on this planet. We have seen this happen in the case of nuclear weapons. Although their actual use has so far occurred only in the Second World War, the number of nuclear weapons that were produced and made ready for use was so large that if the weapons had actually been used, the result could have been the ruin of the human race, as well as of many kinds of animals.\nWilliam Shakespeare said, \"The web of our life is of a _ yarn, good and ill together.\" The above brief review the application of only one part of human activities--science seems to prove what Shakespeare said. But does it have to be so? Must the ill always go together with the good? Are we biologically programmed for war?"

My sister looked on enviously.\nI went into the dressing room to try it on. So sure was I that this skirt would change me, somehow make me not what I am but what I wished to be. I slid my jeans off and put it on. I looked in the mirror. There I was -- a terrible girl in a Superman T-shirt and sneakers. My glasses fogged up as I started to cry. www.zxxk.com\nThe skirt did not change me. Though it fit well and might make me look good in the eyes of today's world, it was not me. I am not a girl who wears cool clothes to fit in.\nI took the thing off and slid back into the comfort of modesty. My mom knocked on the door. \"Emily, are you okay?\"\nI wiped away my tears. \"I'm fine.\" I looked in the mirror again and saw a slim girl with funny glasses. I saw myself."

A new computer science technology may be able to help your clothing to do just that.\nMark Jones, a computer scientist, says, \"We view electronic textiles   as, sort of, where computing meets the fabric  .\"\nThis high-tech _ is bringing up the wearable computers, like trousers that can interpret movement and let a computer know your every move.\nA loom   helps make the wires and fabric together. Then special equipment in the fabric can measure the speed. Signals are then sent from the trousers to a computer to show the process.\nTom Martin also says, \"E-textiles are a way for us to build wearable computers that look like normal clothing and can fit in fully with the environment.\"\nResearchers also hope wearable computers will help save lives. \"We will be able to tell what activity a person is doing. That sort of information is highly valuable when we're trying to monitor someone with a long-term illness such as heart disease,\" Jones says. Monitoring your every step is something that clever clothing can do a little easier. Researchers plan on developing more smart clothes to integrate computers into shirts, hats and gloves."

      "I am a music store owner. One day, when I was cleaning the instruments in my store, I saw an old man come in. His short steps dragged on the carpet. \"Is 77 too old to learn the banjo  ?\" he asked.\n\"You can learn to play it well,\" I replied, holding back my doubts. My mind told me I was giving false encouragement. I reached the instructor's schedule and gave the rates, the available time and the additional information that he would need. To my surprise and delight, the old man, Carl, began banjo lessons three days later with my most patient teacher.\nWith nothing to do at home but practice, Carl made surprising progress. After breakfast he practiced for his required half hour. While waiting for lunch he picked up his banjo again for just a couple of minutes. Since TV was difficult for him to see and hear, he often played the banjo in the evenings. Carl was always early for lessons so it was a surprise that he didn't arrive one Tuesday.\nThe next morning I listened to the answering machine with sadness. \"Carl's in hospital,\" the voice recorded.\nTwo months later, I shared the newspaper _ with the banjo teacher. We both shed tears for a surprisingly clever banjo student.\nSeveral months later, a woman came into the store carrying a plant. \"This is for Carl's banjo teacher,\" she said. \"I'm his wife, Mary.\"\n\"Why did Carl want to play the banjo?\" I asked. Mary took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \"Carl was at some show when he was 10 years old. He came close to the stage to watch the performers. When they were packing up their instruments, the banjo player said to Carl, 'You want to see this up close?' Carl climbed up on the stage and from then on he wanted to play the banjo.\" Carl had waited 67 years to realize a dream! Mary gave the plant to Carl's banjo teacher. \"Thank you for the best six months of his life,\" she said."

      "The quality of drinking water in Shanghai will meet European Union standard soon and, a decade later, citizens in Shanghai will drink the best water in the world.\nThese were the goals set out by the Shanghai Water Authority. With the city's population expected to increase only slightly and the economy to boom by 2020, Chen Yin, an official with the water authority, said Shanghai's water use will not increase from its present amount.\nZhang Yue, director of the Urban Construction Division under the Ministry of Construction, said, \"Shanghai is the first city in the country to publicize these goals. They will not be easy to achieve.\"\nHe said water saving will help keep the sustainable  development of China's economy.\nSaving one cubic meter of water means saving the city's infrastructure costs by 10,000 Yuan. Last year, Shanghai saved 300 million cubic meters of water either from readjustment of industrial structure or the use of new technology.\n\"The aim is to arouse public awareness of the seriousness of water shortages,\" Chen said. \"The rich surface water and amount of rain of the city are so misleading that they result in improper use of water.\"\nShanghai lacks drinkable water. The Huangpu River, which supplies 80 percent of the city's drinkable water, is drying up.\nThe city, therefore, has been exploring new sources from the Yangtze River and growing forests along it to hold quality water.\nBesides, the authority is popularizing technology among the public to efficiently cut the amount of water used.\nAt present, the city has 600,000 family toilets, each using 13 liters of water per flush. These are to be renovated to use only 9 liters of water per flush.\nThe authority is renovating the first 200 toilets for households - at a cost of 40 Yuan each.\nIn three years, all the toilets will be renovated, which saves the city nearly 15 million Yuan every year in water use.\nAnother task is the treatment of the waste water to improve the water environment.\nAt present the city can only treat 44 percent of its daily 5.04 million tons of waste water. To meet the total demand, 27 more treatment factories are to be set up with an estimated investment of 18 billion Yuan."

      "Eleven-year-old Evan Green doesn't want to save just one tree-he wants to save a whole rainforest!\nIn the Redwood City, Calif, a boy started a group called the Red Dragon Conservation Team four years ago to do just that. So far, the team's members have raised $4,500. That's enough to purchase and protect more than 16 acres of rainforest in Costa Rica through the Center for Ecosystem survival.\nEvery year, thousands of square miles of rainforest are destroyed worldwide. Logging and farming are mostly likely to blame, scientists say. The loss is terrible news for animals and people. Even though rainforests cover less than 2 percent of the earth, they are home to half the world's plants and animals. Rainforests also provide water and help control the earth's climate.\nEvan's work to save the rainforests recently earned him a Barron prize for Young Heroes. The prizes are given to children or teenagers who have made a positive difference in the world. Evan's goal is \"to save enough rainforests to last forever\". He won't have to do it alone. His actions have already inspired other kids to chip in. One girl asked for donations instead of presents on her birthday. She raised $850. Other kids are starting their own conservation teams.\nEvan says everyone can help the planet-even by taking small steps such as recycling. He and his family try to make a difference every day. \"We recycle, we try to limit our garbage... we've been walking a little more, and we buy local food,\" Evan said."

The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much that he even puts it on ice cream!\nPaper House\nRockport, Mass.\nSwedish immigrant   Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much, if any, thought to recycling paper. In fact, \"recycling\" wasn't even a word yet.

      "Digital Trend: BOOKLESS LIBRARIES\nWhat if you could fit all of a library's collection in the palm of your hand? That's part of the idea behind an upcoming bookless public library in San Antonio. Called Biblio Tech, the system will lend out e-readers loaded with 10,000 titles for two-to-three -week periods. But don't bother holding on to the device longer than that because it's programmed to go dead.\nOther libraries have tried similar programs: In 2002, the Santa Rosa Branch Library in Tucson, Arizona, launched a digital-only facility, and a bookless project was proposed last year in Newport Beach, California. Those digital-only projects _ --residents wanted their paperbacks--but Stanford University maintains a successful bookless engineering library with over 65,000 titles. Officials say digital libraries are a low-cost way to educate the masses and argue their rise is inevitable.\nStill, some insist print isn't doomed. A recent Wall Street Journal article notes that e-book purchases skew heavily toward the sort of  \"light entertainment\" novels you can pick up at the grocery store. A survey from the Pew Research Center shows that about 90 percent of digital readers still crack open physical books.( After all, there are only four Twilight books.

Despite their siesta habit,Spanish rank only third after Americans, who sleep more than 8.5 hours. And while more and more French people prefer fast-food chains these days or wolf down a sandwich at their desk, they still spend more than two hour's a day eating.\nThat means their meals are twice as long as those of the average Mexican, who spends just an hour a day on food,the OECD's \"Society at a Glance\" report on work, health and leisure  in Asia, Europe and North and South America found. The Japanese manage to spend close to 2 hours a day eating and drinking, placing them third behind New Zealanders.\nDespite the limited time, Americans spend eating each day---about an hour and a quarter---U.S.obesity  rates are the highest in the 30 members of OECD. The Japanese like to spend their rare free time watching TV or listening to the radio. This takes up 47 percent of leisure time in Japan. Norwegians spend the most time at leisure,just over a quarter of their day,while at the low end,Mexicans spend just 16 percent of their time having fun.\nThe OECD has 30 members.

      "While taking pictures of a curious five-month-old fox, photographer Simbn Czapp soon realized his subject had quite an interest in photography herself. The clever fox was so curious about the camera equipment that she climbed ri^it on top of it. And while she was supposed to be the subject of the shoot, the fox stood on the shutter release button  and took her own frames.\nMr Czapp visited the New Forest Wildlife Park to capture images of new arrival Jessie. She has been at the animal park in Ashjurst, Hampshire--home to wolves, deer and other animals in 25 acres of ancient woodland--after being abandoned by her mother.\nMr Czapp said, \"Jessie was very playful and curious and not at all camera shy. Soon after I arrived she was chewing my shoes and everything seemed to be a game to her. Then she started exploring the camera I had set up on a tripod  .She stood on her back legs to look at the back of the camera. She balanced her front paws on it and at one point knocked it over.\"\nHe put the camera back on the tripod and Jessie soon jumped back up. At one point she had all four paws on the camera and was keeping her balance. Mr Czapp added, \"She jumped up there several times and I realized it could make a good picture. As I was leaving with the public' s viewing window behind me, I thought I heard the camera go off but didn't think much of it. But when I checked the memory card afterwards, I was amazed to see Jessie had actually taken two pictures of me photographing her. I couldn't believe a fox had gained an advantage over me! Jessie is a lovely little fox. There were some lovely photos of her but she obviously thought the photographer was worthy of a picture too!,"

      "As I was reading a recent story in Slate on 20-somethings complaining about how the economy was ruining their life plans, I couldn't help but think the 20-somethings sounded like a bunch of spoiled children who grew up expecting everything to be easy for them. As a 20-something myself, I certainly share their disappointment: my husband and I probably won't be able to buy a house until we're in our 40s, and we too are burdened by student loans . But why should it be any different? Being young persons in America, shouldn't they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers?\nConsider some of these views shared in the Slate story: Jennifer, 29, owner of a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, worries that she won't be able to have children for at least a decade because they can't afford to buy a house yet.\nI read that, and I thought, what planet is she living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids? Has she ever visited a developing country, or even downtown areas in this one? Home ownership is a luxury , not a fertility requirement.\nA 26-year-old in the story despairs that he can't afford to get a Ph.D. in literature. Well, that sounds a bit like expressing disappointment that no one will pay you to write poetry on the beach in Thailand for five years.\nYes, it's sad that these young people feel so lost. But I think the problem is their extremely high expectations, not economic reality. Beth Kobliner, author of Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties, says that she thinks people's expectations are slowly adjusting, but today's 20-somethings grew up at a time when everyone's wealth appeared to be expanding. Their parents probably saw their home values rise along with their investments. \"So you have people who have grown up in an environment where people had great expectations of what living well means,\" says Kobliner.\nThis recession will certainly play a role in forcing those expectations into more realistic group. In the meantime, it seems a lot better for our mental health to focus on being grateful-for our one-bedroom apartments, for living in modern cities, or perhaps just for being able to eat three meals a day-than on longing for some kind of luxury life."

      "I moved into a new house in July. Since then I have met a few of my neighbors who are very nice people. For Christmas, I thought I would do something nice for each of the neighbors I know. There were nine neighbors whom I knew by name or spoke with often when I was out in my yard. I knew which houses they lived in.\nI decided to add one more to my list. This lady I decided to add lives down the street from me. I meet her every morning walking to work as I drive down the street. She always smiles to me. But I had no idea who she was and which house she lived in.\nI planned to make small fruit baskets and leave them on my neighbor's front porches  on Christmas Eve. I signed the cards: \"Happy Holidays from 5104 Northumberland Road.\"\nI saved the last for the friendly lady. I finally decided on a house where I met her each morning and guessed that it was hers.\nMy neighbors really appreciated the baskets and would tell me as they saw me in the yard or they would call, and a couple even came by to thank me.\nThis morning I found a small note in the mailbox. It was addressed simply: Resident, 5104 Northumberland Road.\nThe Thank You card really caught me by surprise. I opened it and read the message, \"Thank you for the lovely fruit basket you left on our porch. It was very thoughtful. Richard Kelly passed away last week. He talked a lot about how nice it was that someone remembered him in his time of illness. He really appreciated it.\"\nI had no idea who Richard Kelly was and that he had been seriously ill. I had left that nice lady's basket on his porch by mistake. I wanted to say sorry, but that would be wrong. I believe that Mr. Kelly was meant to have that basket because he was dying. I hate that the nice lady did not get to receive a fruit basket on Christmas, but I believe if she knew what had happened, she would be happy. I feel pleased to have helped Richard Kelly's last days be more cheerful."

      "Have you ever wondered how a popular food or dessert was first created? Read on and find out about several of them.\nChewing gum--Although ancient Greeks,Mayans,and early American settlers chewed sap from trees, the first commercial chewing gum was made and sold by John B. Curtis in 1848. In 1850, Curtis began selling flavored gums.\nPizza--In Italy in the early 1700s, flat breads, called pizzas, were made without toppings.These tasty,filling breads were sold to the poor in Naples.When Maria Carolina, the queen of Naples, tasted one, she persuaded her husband, King Ferdinand IV, to allow this peasant dish to be made in the royal kitchen.Almost 200 years later,during her travels around the country, Italy's queen Margherita saw Italian peasants eating pizza breads.She had a taste and fell in love with pizza. She ordered the most famous pizza cook of the day, Raffaele Esposito, to create for her a pizza made of tomato, basil, and cheese to look like the color1s of the Italian flag. This remains the basis of the American version of the pizza.\nThe ice-cream-cone--In 1904, Italo Marchiony got a patent  to produce ice-cream cones. The same year at the ST. Louis World's Fair, a Syrian waffle  seller Ernest Hamwi heard that a nearby ice-cream seller had run out of dishes to serve his cream. Hamwi rolled some of his waffles into a cone  shape and offered them to his neighbor, who put ice-cream in the cones and sold them. This first fully eatable, portable  treat was a hit with customers immediately.\nM&Ms--During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, Forrest Mars, Sr., saw soldiers eating pieces of chocolate covered with a hard sugary coating, which kept the chocolate from melting in the sun. Using this idea, Mars developed M&Ms in 1941. In 1954, Mars ntroduced M&Ms Peanut Chocolate Candies, along with the now famous slogan, \"The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.\""

      "It was evening when my parents and I ventured across Nemeiben Lake, in Northern Saskatchewan. This vast lake had a unique reputation as being the best fishing and tourist resort.\nWith the boat undocked and the gear and luggage stored beneath the security of the seats, we set off into the setting sun at 8:30.\nUnlike my parents , I had never been on a fishing boat before and was captivated  by the speed and grace in which it traveled through the waves. The lake was deserted as the sky began to darken and looked more threatening by the minute.\nSuddenly the boat hit something with such a force that we all fell over in our seats. The whole boat shook for a moment, before water started to trickle slowly over stern. My father went to the back and after many attempts to start the engine, he began to look very worried. The water was now rushing in at a much faster rate, tipping the boat at an awkward angle.\nWe tried our best to hold on to something. The worst was yet to come. With our life jackets secured and fastened, we waited as the boat sank deeper into the water. We were soon immersed in the chilly depths. The biting cold was more terrifying than anyone could imagine.\nMy parents, who were dressed in floater jackets, clung desperately to each other, trying to keep their heads above water. I, on the other hand, wasn't so fortunate. A strong gust of wind blew briskly across the lake, bringing with it, torrential rain and threatening thunderstorms. The strong waves carried me on into the night. The waves continued to pound violently, forcing me underwater.\nThe following morning a fisherman found us. By that time, our body temperatures were twenty-four degrees, which meant we were nearly dead. Later investigation showed that we had been in the water for fifteen hours."

      "A cat with his own Facebook page and Instagram account is taking the Internet by storm thanks to his expressive eyebrows. Curious-looking Sam has racked up 150,000 Instagram followers and 530,000 likes on Facebook since bursting onto the scene in 2012.\nOwner Amanda Collado, 26, from New York, has been handling the large amount of requests from fans and media for the past three years. She said, \"There have definitely been situations where I have had to ignore friends, family or work to take the time to do Sam's posts or answer emails on his behalf. Everyone gets a little annoyed when I'm on my phone and not paying attention to them. I never thought Sam would be so popular.\"\nAmanda's mum, Ivette Rodriguez, noticed the abandoned cat outside her home one evening.\nIvette said, \"I saw a little niche   next to the house and there was a cat in there. He willingly gave himself up to me--I guess he was so tired of being outside.\"\nAmanda created an Instagram account for Sam after a friend pointed out his expressive brows. She said, \"I didn't notice his eyebrows initially.\"\n\"He had about 800 followers at first--but in February someone posted his photo on Reddit and he blew up overnight--I woke up with 1600 followers. From there we made a Facebook and all other social media accounts.\"\nAmanda posts pictures to Sam's account every two days, but spends most of her day keeping up with all of his fans. But the effort she puts into her pet's social media has paid off--and she has bigger plans for Sam's future, including merchandise  .\n\"Right now we're trying to share him in a free way. Eventually we'll sell Sam merchandise, because I know many people do like having cute little mugs, Sam mugs, or posters, T-shirts.\""

      "All over the world people enjoy sports. Sports help people to keep healthy, happy and help them to live longer. Sports change with the seasons. People play different games in winter and summer.\nGames and sports often grow out of people's work and everyday activities. The Arabs use horses or camels in much of their everyday life; they use them in their sports, too.\nSome sports are so interesting that people everywhere go in for them. Football, for example, has spread around the world. Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers.\nSome sports or games go back thousands of years, like running or jumping. Chinese boxing, for example, has a very long history. But basketball and volleyball are rather new. Neither one is a hundred years old yet. People are inventing new sports or games all the time.\nPeople from different countries may not be able to understand each other, but after a game they often become good friends. Sports help to train a person's character. One learns to fight hard but fight fair, to win without pride and to lose with grace."

      "Have you ever heard the saying \"All roads lead to Rome\"? At one time, this was pretty much true. During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire."

      "When learning a second language,it is important to study the culture of the language you're learning.Anyone can learn another language's grammar from a textbook,but what good is this learning if you don't understand the culture of the person you're speaking to? Only in learning another language and its culture will you be able to proficiently communicate with a person in that language.There are many ways to enhance your language studies by studying the country's culture;this can include reading literature,watching movies,or listening to popular music.\nMany schools in the United States emphasize the importance of culture understanding in language classes.Instead of memorizing only vocabulary words and grammar patterns,classes from elementary schools to universities are teaching literature,pop songs,and films in their classes.From these various mediums students can learn a great deal about the culture of a language they study.These different forms of media can teach various characteristics about the language,culture,and history of a society.\nLiterature can allow you to understand the history and current debates confronting a culture.For example,if you read John Steinbeck's GraPes of Wrath you can understand the history and problems of ordinary American farmers in the Great Depression.In watching films one can learn about what is popular in a society, and also slang phrases one definitely won't find in a textbook.In pop songs one can understand what the current craze in a culture is;what kind of music people like to listen to,what that culture finds romantic,and even what the contemporary\"cool\"viewpoint in that society is.\nIf you truly are interested in learning a language,don't underestimate the importance of learning about the language's home culture.Of course one must learn a language's grammar and vocabulary, but this will only get you so far in actually being able to communicate effectively.So if you are learning a language,take the time to also study the culture."

      "There are two things I can count on my dad asking every time he calls me: \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" and \"How's the car?\" I guess he asks what he can do for me because his dad (an air force officer) was never really there for him, and he's determined to provide me with the support he lacked. During my youth he never missed a school play or softball game. In fact, he wasso supportive that I sometimes longed for one of those dads who dressed better and cared less. But my dad would forever be the guy wearing shorts with dress shoes and black socks, cheering me on, expecting greatness. \nHis other standard question - How's the car? - used to strike me as a waste of long-distance dollars from a man who once suggested making a list of what you want to talk about before calling someone out of state. What I now realize is that \"How's the car?\" is not about the car. It's a father's way of asking his adult daughter how she is doing. The advantage is that if there's something wrong with the car, he knows what to do about it and how much it will cost, whereas if you're having problems about marriage or doubting a career choice, he might have to act Mom on the line. \nAt age thirty I finally took the plunge   into adulthood by renting a car without my dad's help or advice. I'm sure my dad was hurt rather than proud. Though a daughter's independence is evidence of a job well done, it still implies the job's done, and many fathers are unwilling to retire. Even when my dad was overworked, he'd happily jump on a plane if I said I needed help. His frequent question \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" underlines the fact that he wishes there was still something he could provide. It's interesting: even though we're tied by blood and I love him no matter what, he still seems to need a concrete function - suggesting stocks, finding the cheapest plane fare - to feel he has a role in my life."

      "Humankind has tried to improve its standard of living since the very beginning of civilization. Back then, as well as today, providing food and security was the basic task for a person. However, nowadays the range of required goods has expanded significantly. People feel the need for not only some primary things, such as a piece of bread and a roof over their heads, but also for various facilities and luxuries. Providing humanity with these things is connected to the use of natural resources, which requires energy. In turn, the common sources of energy we use today cause pollution, so economic growth is almost unavoidably associated with environmental damage.\nEconomic growth is the increase in numbers of goods and services produced over time by an economy, and it is calculated in terms of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Before growth is calculated, inflation  is adjusted in order to take into account its misleading effect on the price of goods and services. Economic growth can also be explained as the increase in expected output, which results from an increase in actual output, or total demand.\nThere are certain aspects of economic growth which affect the environment. The first of these is the fact that in order to produce more goods and products, at a faster rate, the construction of large industrial plants is required. These plants produce a lot of waste, leading to the pollution of water and the atmosphere, which may cause negative long term health effects to nearby populations of animals, or people. _ also lead to global warming.\nIndustrial manufacturing leads to the constantly increasing energy consumption. The traditional energy sources, which are commonly used nowadays, are considered to be the greatest polluters to the environment. There also exist so-called eco-friendly sources of energy. They are sometimes preferred but replacing the traditional sources with them also requires time, during which people have to make some sacrifices to support these undertakings.\nIn order to produce economically practical energy, a sometimes significant transformation of the natural site is often inevitable. This is expensive and, has harmful effects on the environment. Application of wind energy would block airflows' natural speed which is the reason for their decrease in strength, after crossing the windmill. Consequently, the pressure balance that is brought about by this current will be affected, and it is important to remember that the environment and weather conditions are directly affected by atmospheric pressure.\nFor these reasons, bringing about economic growth without any resulting environmental damage, whatsoever, is impossible."

      "Every dog has his day, and this Friday, June 21, just happens to be a really big one.\nIt's Take Your Dog to Work Day, your four-legged friend's turn to prove who is truly the boss. The day was founded in 1999 to celebrate the incredible companionship dogs provide and to encourage animal adoption.\nDogs have been having their day for some time now. Everywhere you look, there is some kind of pet-project going on, which for a dog lover like me, is a dream come true.\nThere are dogs starring in reality TV. Doggy day care is in high demand. Big well-known companies like Paul Mitchell, Omaha Steaks, and Harley Davidson have all jumped on the gravy-train   offering pet products including shampoos, food and clothes. The pet insurance business is booming. And, luxury hotels and apartment buildings are also catering to our furry friends, finally.\nMake no bones about it, the pet industry is a multi-billion dollar business. According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It's estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.\nThat's a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  . Since then, dogs have become faithful companions not only at home but also as service dogs, in the workplace and on the battlefield.\nIn addition to the unconditional love, companionship and sense of security that comes with dog ownership, there are also many health benefits. Research shows that owning a pet can help a person increase their amount of exercise, reduce their stress and lower their blood pressure.\nAnd if that's not enough good news, here's more. The entire week is \"Take Your Pet to Work Week\" so there's no need to go to the office without your furry or even feathered (if your pet is a bird) friend."

She allowed us to make her classroom our home.\nShe was passionate   about her job. She let us choose the books we wanted to read next, which made me more interested in books. It wasn't what we had to read, but what we wanted to read. Whenever we would present ideas about literature or poems, her eyes would light up and she would become excited.\nShe always made sure everyone was having fun in her class and brought cakes to the classroom every Friday for our silent reading time. She was patient when we got out of hand (,). She was always cheerful, which made me enjoy coming to school. Ms Petoskey is the teacher I still visit and chat with (even after five years). She is the teacher I can thank for making me enjoy reading!"

      "Here's one very simple but lifechanging advice that I first heard from Brian Tracy. Cut down on the TV at night by just one hour. Instead, use that hour to read books that could improve your life.\nIf you're a salesman, google for the best and most useful books on improving your sales.\nThis applies   to all fields, not just the work-related   ones. Maybe you want to improve your health, become a more energetic person. Or maybe you want to improve your study, your relations or perhaps do some personal development.\nOne hour a day is not much. But if you read for one hour a day on weekdays, that's about 260 hours a year. That's a large number of books and a lot of useful advice.\nIf you follow the ideas, who knows what great things and feelings could come into your life. Also, all that information and advice will start to open up your mind. You will start to see more chances in your life.\nNow, you might think something like this:\n1. I really don't have the money...\nAnswer: Visit your public library or search the database  . Or look for books that are used in places like amazon.com.\n2. I really don't have the time...\nAnswer: Buy audiobooks and listen to them in the car while driving to and from work. Or copy them to your MP3-player and listen while riding your bike /bus to work or school. Recently selling audiobooks through MP3-downloads has become popular...\nShut off the TV a little earlier and start reading."

      "You've heard of fast food, but what about slow food?\nSlow food is an international movement. It promotes home cooking, and the use of fresh, unprocessed produce. It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food. It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries. And its symbol is one of the world's slowest moving creatures, the snail. The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement. This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives. And now, within the movement, there's Slow Money, Slow Travel, Slow Parenting, Slow Art and Slow Media, among many others. In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed. One of the Institute's slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West. She said, \"Everything worth doing in life, is worth doing slowly.\" Do you agree? No need to answer straight away. Have a long hard think about it. Take your time. And get back to us when you can."

      "Businesses put lots of time and money into new plans, programs and excellent employees with the hope things will change. Yet, at the end of the effort, not much changes. What happens?\nIn most cases, those new plans, programs and employees enter a company with an existing culture  . And plans, programs and new employees have a way of conforming to the existing culture. The culture of your business is the result of a particular mindset, or a particular way of thinking and the general feelings about certain things. Most often, it is the mindset of the founder or people managing the business.\nThe founder has gotten to where he is because of his skill sets, knowledge base and personal beliefs, which unfortunately all come with inherent  limits. Why Skills, knowledge and beliefs come from what he or she already knows or has experienced. In other words, it comes from the past. We (people) try to make the past fit the future. Just because something worked in the past, doesn't mean it is suitable for the future. As the saying goes, if you do and think what you have always done and thought, you will have what you have always had.\nTherefore, lasting changes have to start with the way people think. To make changes in the way you think, you will be required to set goals beyond your basic abilities and continuously think them through. It is a way to train yourself and people to get out of the comfort zone where you feel happy with your knowledge and skills."

      "For most people, Christmas is a time to relax in the company of family and friends. But for Santa Claus, and the thousands of fake Santas who impersonate  him every year, the Christmas season is time to get to work.\nAlthough  Santa Claus waits until Christmas Eve to take his famous sleigh   ride, Santa impersonators can be found at shopping malls around America throughout the six weeks leading up to December 25. \"When you see Santa talking with kids at your local mall, that's when you know Christmas really is on the way,\" says Mary Lewine of New York City.\nWith the excitement of Christmas, people often forget about the real people behind the red robes   and white beards, but being a mall Santa. is a tough job. \"There is more to it than just sitting in a chair. There is more to it than just a red suit,\" said Timothy Connaghan, who has worked as a Santa for.38 years. \"Children can really put the wear and tear on you.\"\nA recent survey showed some of the challenges that mall Santas face every year. About 90 percent of Santas claimed that children pulled their beards to see if they were real, and 60 percent said that up to ten kids cough or sneeze on them every day. Even more disturbing, one-third of the Santas admit to having children wet themselves while sitting on their laps.\nSo why would anyone take this job? For Ben Brauch, a retired high school teacher who has worked as a Santa for the last six years, the answer is simple-the children. \"I see maybe 12,000 kids in a six-week period.\nIt's hard work, but it's worth it because you get to play with kids.\" In fact, Brauch loves his job so much that he keeps his white beard long all year."

      "No matter how long your life is, you will, at best, be able to read only a few books of all that have been written, and the few you do read should include the best. It is to be expected that the selections will change with the times. Yet there is a surprising uniformity   in the lists which represent the best choices of any period.\nWhat are the signs by which we may recognize a great book? The four I will mention may not be all there are, but they are the ones I've found most useful in explaining my choices over the years.\nGreat books are probably the most widely read. They are not best sellers for a year or two. They are enduring best sellers. GONE WITH THE WIND has had relatively few readers compared to the plays of Shakespeare or DONQUIXOTE. It would be reasonable to estimate that Homer Iliad has been read by at least 25,000,000 people in the last 3000 years.\nGreat books are popular, not pedantic . They are not written by specialists about specialties for specialists. Whether they are philosophy or science, or history or poetry, they treat of human, not academic problems. They are written for men, not professors. To read a textbook for advanced students, you have to read an elementary textbook first. But the great books can be considered elementary in the sense that they treat the elements of any subject matter. They are not related to one another as a series of textbooks, graded in difficulty or in the technicality of the problems with which they deal.\nGreat books are always contemporary, the most readable and instructive.\nGreat books deal with the persistently unsolved problems of human life. There are genuine mysteries in the world that mark the limits of human knowing and thinking. Great minds acknowledge mysteries honestly. Wisdom is fortified  , not destroyed, by understanding its limitations."

      "When I was a kid, I used to spend hours listening to Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky on their Sunday night radio showLoveline.I listened so often that I began to use one of their well-known phrases--\"good times\"--in my daily conversations. Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: behavioral _ .\nYou've probably experienced this before: after spending enough time with another person, you might start to pick up on his or her behavior or speech habits. You might even start to develop your friend's habits without realizing it. There is a large body of literature concerning this sort of phenomenon, and it regularly happens for everything from body postures to accents to drink patterns. For example, one study found that young adults were more likely to drink their drink directly after their same-sex drinking partners, than for the two individuals to drink at their own paces.\nAnd the effect isn't limited to real-life face-to-face activities. Another study found that the same you-drink-then-I-drink pattern held even when watching a movie! In other words, people were more likely to take a drink of their drinks in a theater after watching the actors on the screen enjoy a drink. At least I don't feel so strange anymore, having picked up on Adam Carolla's \"good times\".\nNew research published today in the journalPLOS ONEindicates that the same sort of behavioral mimicry is responsible for social eating, at least among university-age women of normal weight. That's right: the young women were more likely to adjust their eating according to the eating pace of their same-sex dining companion.\nAs with most experiments, these results raise a whole new set of questions. Still, the finding that behavioral mimicry may at least partly account for eating behavior is important, and has real effects on health. The researchers note that \"as long as people don't fully recognize such important influences on intake, it will be difficult to make healthy food choices and keep a healthy diet, especially when people are exposed to the eating behavior of others\"."

      "If you want to be a volunteer, you have to answer the following typical questions. Do you want to work with people, animals or machines? Do you want to work indoors or outdoors, directly serve people in need or serve people behind the scenes? Every year, thousands of people in the west offer volunteer service. Volunteering greatly strengthens the community because it helps the old, the young, the weak, the sick, and the disabled and the injured to solve problems.\nVolunteers usually help in many different ways. They may give people advice, offer friendship to the young, drive the elderly to church (if up to the driving age), advise kids against drugs, work as assistants in schools or nursing homes, raise funds, plant trees, help out in local libraries and do many other things. Volunteering can be a few hours a week or a few hours a month. Anybody who wants to serve people in need can become a volunteer.\nIn fact, the art of volunteering is a process of both giving and receiving. Volunteering allows volunteers to meet new people, make new friends and mix with people from all walks of life. Volunteering is an excellent way to experiment and try out new techniques and skills, discover your individual talents and explore career choice. Being a volunteer will take you on a wonderful journey and help you learn more than what you can get from books."

      "When I first told people I was going to work in Cameroon, the most common reaction was: \"Why?\" The second was: \"It's in Africa; you'll die!\" The third: \"Where is that?\"\nSo let me give some answers. I was offered a job that looked interesting in a part of the world I'd never been to before. I'd also long had an interest in Africa, so I decided it was time to find out the reality.\nA small amount of research showed that in more than 40 years since gaining independence, Cameroon has been a peaceful country with no wars. Not only are there no wars, but Cameroon is a food exporter to the region.\nNow, after three years, I can say that these have been the healthiest years of my life! No malaria or any of the other frightening diseases you read about when Africa is mentioned. The worst thing that ever happened to me was a bout of food poisoning -- once.\nSo what is it like to teach here? Well surprisingly not so different from teaching anywhere else.\nMost students come to us with a bit of English in their heads. Cameroon is a bilingual country with French and English as official languages, while there are also close to 200 local ethnic languages in a country of 16 million people. French is the _ language, spoken by about 80% of the population.\nThe local school system is very traditional and somewhat strict. Perhaps not surprisingly when there can be up to 150 students in the classroom (of which maybe 30 have the books, and there are probably seats for 70).\nLike anywhere else, students appreciate it if you know a bit about their country, and not just Roger Milla (the top scorer of the 1990 World Cup, in case you're wondering). It helps if you know the names of the ten provinces, know who the first president was, or can say a word in a local language.\nSo in conclusion: Cameroon isn't just football. Not is it war, poverty and disease. It's just life and people, like anywhere else."

      "Dear Water--Use It Wisely,\nMore and more water is getting wasted each day. I want to help out and teach people how to conserve water. Please continue reading because your organization is very influential. I had an idea that you could send some workers from your organization to schools all around the world, and they could inform the students about water usage.\nDid you know that every minute, 1,000,000,000(one billion) tons of water falls to the earth from rain? We are lucky to have rainwater. It helps fill up our lakes. There is about 326,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water on Earth. Yes, this is tons, but it is getting wasted.\nEveryone needs water. So why waste it? I think it is very irresponsible to let the water run when you are not at home. We can use water with respect by making good choices. Take a shower instead of a bath, use an automatic dishwasher instead of hand washing. You can buy Earthfriendly cleaner spray, so that our drinking water will not be polluted. If your washer isn't full, then don't start it. With water being wasted every day, by the time we get to the 3000s we are going to have to survive on milk and juice! Won't that be boring? That means we will have to give our dogs a bowl of juice instead of water with their food. I mean, come on,we're talking real life here!\nWater wasting needs to come to a stop and without delay. Water-Use It Wisely, PLEASE inform people about their water usage! It plays a big role in my life. It would be really great if you take part in spreading the news about this!

      "Copenhagen, one of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities, has begun turning its extensive network of cycle paths into bike highways in an effort to push more commuters   to leave their cars at home.\nConsidered one of Europe's two \"bicycle capitals\" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become jammed. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to increase the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 33 percent it is today to more than 50 percent by 2015. Within the city, 55 percent of all commuters already travel by bike.\nAlready Copenhagen stands out among other European capitals for its cycling infrastructure, counting more than 390 kilometers of bike paths."

      "Sherlock Holmes is considered by many people as the greatest detective in fictional literature. He is, in fact, more famous than his own creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the popular series of stories, Holmes is described as \"tall and lean, pope-smoking, always in his cape and speaks in a splendid manner\". Doyle gave Holmes' address as 221-B Baker Street, London, and to this day some visitors to London still go to Baker Street to search for 221-B. Of course, there never was really any such address. Holmes' flat was supposed to be shared by the lovable, but sometimes clumsy Doctor Watson who went around with Holmes trying to solve crimes before Holmes did. Poor Dr Watson lost out to Holmes every time.\nDoyle gave Holmes a masterly skill of deduction---the ability to come up with interesting conclusion from the simplest clues found at the scene of a crime. Doyle said that the description of Holmes was modeled on one of his lecturers at Edinburgh University where he studied medicine. That man was Dr Joseph Bell. Sherlock Holmes first appeared in Doyle's A Study in Scarlet published in 1887. Holmes was so loved by all that when his author killed him off in one of his stories, readers wrote in anger to complain. They refused to allow Holmes to die! Holmes was brought back to \"life\" and appeared in further stories.\nThe stories of Sherlock Holmes have been reprinted many times ever since then. Today we can watch Holmes at work on cinema and television screens as well as on stage."

Well, _ Greg is now stuck at home with his family and all this gives him a bad case of cabin fever.\nKinney says that the book is not only about the claustrophobia   of being stuck at home for days without being able to leave, but also about getting stuck with an identity.Sometimes we get stuck a certain way when we are young and it's hard to change people's feelings of us.That's some pretty deep stuff  , but we expect the book to mostly be full of silly and funny stuff that will make us laugh.\nThe first printing of Cabin Fever will print 6 million copies of the book.Many kids who don't like to read like the Wimpy Kid books because of the combination of cartoons, story, and comedy.Cabin Fever, like the other five, will have 224 pages of cartoons and funny events in the life of Greg Heffley as he sits out his holidays snowbound at home.\n    They are generally recommended for kids 8 to 11 years of age, but older kids (even adults) may find them funny as they remember what it was like to be in middle school."

I did not do my best. Not for the ribbon exercise, nor for the club exercise. Knowing that I could have reached a little further to catch my ribbon, focused a little more so the stick wouldn't slip through my fingers, tried a little harder to clean up those errors, but I didn't, still bothers me.\nAfter my disappointing competition, I tried my best to keep my eyes dry. But soon tears burned the edges of my eyes, and as I blinked, the first tear rolled down my cheek.

I had messed up--that wasn't anyone's fault but mine--and crying wouldn't help at all. \"Why are you crying, Amanda?\" she asked, perhaps more pointedly   than intended, but I heard the concern in her voice. Unable to form all the emotions into words, I just looked away and avoided her questions.\n\"Tell me now why you're crying.\" Her voice this time wasn't as gentle as it was before; it was filled with frustration and impatience. \"Why are you crying?\" she whispered again, but this time her voice was shaky and flooded with pain. This was the first time I'd ever seen my mom cry; my mom, who was always so strong and was there to encourage me through the roughest times, was now crying, and I was the reason for it. Finding my voice, I tentatively asked, \"Why are you crying?\"\nShe looked at me and answered exactly what I was afraid to hear, \"I hate to see you hurting yourself.\" So it was my fault. I had put those tears in her eyes. I had filled her with pain, with helplessness and with sadness.\nI'll never forget her pained expression. It forced me to realize how shortsighted and close-minded I'd been. I decided that no matter what happens in the future, I will never lose myself to regret."

      "We once had a poster competition in our fifth grade art class.\n\"You could win prizes,\" our teacher told us as she wrote the poster information on the blackboard. She passed out sheets of construction paper while continuing, \"The first prize is ten dollars. You just have to make sure that the words on the blackboard appear somewhere on your poster. \"\nWe studied the board carefully. Some of us looked with one eye and held up certain colors against the blackboard, rocking the sheets to the right or left while we _ our designs. Others twisted their hair around their fingers or chewed their erasers while deep in thought. We had plans for that ten-dollar grand prize, each and every one of us. I'm going to spend mine on candies, one hopeful would announce, while another practiced looking serious, wise and rich.\nEveryone in the class made a poster. Some of us used parts of those fancy paper napkins, while others used nothing but colored construction paper. Some of us used big designs, and some of us preferred to gather our art tidily down in one corner of our poster and let the space draw the viewer's attention to it. Some of us would wander past the good students' desks and then return to our own projects with a growing sense of hopelessness. It was yet another grown-up trick of the sort they seemed especially fond of, making all of us believe we had a fair chance, and then always--always--rewarding the same old winners.\nI believe I drew a sailboat, but I can't say that with any certainty. I made it. I admired it. I determined it to be the very best of all of the posters I had seen, and then I turned it in.\nMinutes passed. No one came along to give me the grand prize, and then someone distracted  me, and I probably never would have thought about that poster again.\nI was still sitting at my desk, thinking, What poster?

      "Twenty years is just a blink in time. But 20 years is also long enough for a man to grow up. It is always painful. For Andrew Agassi, maturing in the spotlight of international tennis competition was even harder.\nOn September 3, the American tennis player said a tearful goodbye to his 21-year career after a third-round defeat in the US Open. The 36-year-old tried his best, but was unable to keep up with German Benjamin Becker, _ \n\"The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is what I've found,\" Agassi said to the fans. \"I have found inspiration and you willed me to succeed.\" It was an emotional speech at the end of a long career.\nAgassi hated tennis as a teenager as much as he loves it now. His father made him play when he was a child. He got bored, and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle. He grew hair long, wore colorful clothes and spat at a judge. Over the years, he has made bad jokes during news conferences. Asked what he would say to his 17-year-old self, Agassi answered, \"I would say, I understand you a lot more than I want to be you.\"\nThe turning point in Agassi's career came in 1992 when he unexpectedly won his first Grand Slam  at Wimbledon. It was the first time Agassi understood what real champions finally understand: winning is a test of courage and not just power, it's a marathon, not a sprint .\nAnd what a marathon Agassi was about to begin. He cut his long hair, got fitter and tightened up emotionally. On the court, he ranked No. 1 for almost two years. His lowest point came in 1997 when his ranking dropped to No. 141. He didn't quit though. \"I knew that I would try to get the most out of myself every day from that day forward. That was my promise,\" he said. \"That never stopped.\" www.zxxk.com"

      "Detective Keeling took his client--a goodlooking lady into the back yard of the store together. The lady opened a door in the wall and they entered the small room behind the store. They crossed the room to a locked door.\nMr. Keeling took some special keys from his pocket. Moments later, one of the keys unlocked the door. The lady went into the store. She said she would hide under the table to keep watch on her husband. Mr. Keeling did not follow her.\nThe detective went quickly to the policeman's house. Then the two men hurried to the jewellery store. They looked through the window. The policeman was surprised. He spoke to Mr. Keeling, \"I don't understand. You told me, 'Robbins took a young woman to a restaurant.' Where is she?\"\n\"There she is!\" said Mr. Keeling. He pointed through the window.\n\"Do you know the lady with Robbins?\" asked the policeman.\n\"That's his secret friend,\" said Mr. Keeling.\n\"No! You're wrong! That's Robbins' wife,\" said the policeman. \"I've known her for fifteen years.\"\n\"What?\" the detective shouted. His face became pale. \"Who is under the table in the store?\" He started to kick the door of the jewellery store. Mr. Robbins came to the door and opened it. The policeman and the detective ran into the store.\n\"Look under that table!\" shouted the detective. \"Be quick!\"\nThe policeman lifted the cloth and put his arm under the table. He pulled out a black dress, a black veil and a woman's wig .\n\"Is this young lady your wife?\" Mr. Keeling asked the jeweller. He pointed at the woman.\n\"Yes! She is my wife!\" said Mr. Robbins angrily. \"Why did you kick my door? Why are those clothes under my table?\"\n\"Please check all the jewellery in your store, Mr. Robbins,\" the policeman said. \"Is anything missing?\"\nSome diamond rings and some expensive necklaces were missing. The missing jewellery was worth $800. Later that night, Mr. Keeling was sitting in his office. He was looking through a big book of photographs. They were photographs of criminals. The policeman had brought the book to the detective's office. Suddenly, Mr. Keeling stopped turning the pages. He looked at a picture of a handsome young man with a familiar face.\nThe next morning, Mr. Keeling paid the jeweller $800, then closed his office."

      "What will higher education look like in 2050? That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students."

      "You're standing in the dairy section at the grocery store, searching for your favorite brand. Suddenly, you catch a smell of chocolate cookies. You forget about dairy and head for the bakery   section. Guess what? You just walked into an odor   trap  ! The odor was cooked up by scientists in a lab.\nFor years, scientists have been studying the special powers of smell. They found that more than our other senses, smell changes our mood and helps us remember things.\nSo companies have begun spending thousands of dollars to scent   entire stores. Artificial   scents are being used to lead customers by the nose. These smells help to get people inside and put them in the mood to buy. They even make customers remember the store later, so they'll come back for more. Also, many companies have smartly made use of product smells. A company added lemon fragrance to its dish cleaner. They wanted people to think the soap contained \"natural\" cleaners. It worked!\nNew uses for smells are being created every day. One bank, for example, gives customers coupons   advertising car loans  . To get people to take out a loan, bank officials hope to coat these coupons with the fresh leather smell of a new car. In Australia, telephone offices are putting sweat odor on unpaid bills. Since some people sweat when they're scared, this smell might remind them of when they were frightened. And they'll pay the bills right away!\nWhat lies ahead for our noses? Smell scientists are working on some pretty far-out ideas. Would you believe TV sets that produce smells? Or how about scent diets? Certain food smells will fool your stomach into thinking it's full. Alarm clocks will scent your bedroom with a strong pleasant smell designed to wake you up. Scientists are even working on ways to keep garbage from smelling. Researchers expect scents to help students make more sense of what they're learning.\nAnd just think."

      "Mary Masterman hasn't decided where she will attend college, but when she does, she'll have plenty of money to pay for it. The 17-year-old took home a $100,000 scholarship Tuesday as the top winner of the 2007 Intel Science Talent Search.\n\"It was a complete surprise,\" said the senior at Westmoore High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. \"I wasn't expecting it.\" Masterman earned first place at this year's competition by building a low-budget spectrograph  -- an instrument that identifies the unique characteristics, or \"fingerprints,\" of different molecules. Spectrographs are used in a variety of fields, including astronomy, medicine, and law enforcement. They can sense the presence of explosives or drugs, and they can also help determine the age of a piece of artwork.\nNormally, the cost of a spectrograph can run as high as $100,000.Mary, however, built her device--which she crafted from lenses, a laser, aluminum   tubing, and a camera--for just $300.\"I wanted to build one that was lower-costing so it would be more available to anyone interested in spectrography,\" she said. \nSticking to a budget was only half the battle. Getting the machine to work was another challenge. \"I had to keep coming up with creative ways to adjust or change something,\" Mary admitted. \"It took three months to build and another three months before it actually functioned properly.\"\nMary competed with more than 1,700 other high school seniors in this year's science challenge. Forty finalists were invited to Washington, D.C., where they presented their projects at the National Institute of Science. In all, 10 students took home awards for their innovative projects."

Everyone seemed to enjoy it, but one comment from a teacher proved to Fialka her family's investment was a success. \"In Baltimore an early childhood teacher came up and said 'I have to apologize to the family of a 4 - year - old with Down Syndrome '\" Fialka said. \"She said 'I told them to be more realistic about their dreams for him. Now I have to tell them I'm sorry.'\"\nThe story of Micah Fialka - Feldman, a 22 - year - old prefix = st1 /OaklandUniversitystudent, is meant to show parents, educators and the disabled anything is possible. Micah wrote in an essay titled \"I wanted to go to college and my dream came true.\" A lot of people didn't think he could go to college, but because family and friends believed in him, he learned how to take public transportation to campus and found teachers who helped him pick the best classes. The title of the film \"Through the same door \"came from a day when Micah, who was admitted to a first grade special education program, told his parents he wanted to walk through the same door as the rest of the kids at his school. It led to him becoming the first student with cognitive disabilities in mainstream classrooms inBerkley.\nThough he can't read or write on his own, Micah reached amazing heights with the help of voice recognition computer software.At Berkley High School, Micah won the Social Studies Department Award for civic involvement. In 2004 she received the Michigan \"Yes, I Can\" award  for self - advocacy . He finished high school in 2003 with a certificate of attendance, and entered OaklandUniversitythrough the Transitions Program.\nFialka said, \"He's the happiest kid in the world.

      "Research by sociologists Scott Coltrance Michele Adams looked at national survey data and found that when men increase their share of housework and childcare, their children are happier, healthier and do better at school.What's more, when school-aged children do housework with their fathers, they get along better with their peers and have more friends.And they show more positive behaviors than if they do the same work with their mothers.\"Because fewer men do housework than women,\" said Adams, \"when they share the work,it has more influence on children.\" Fathers model \"co-operative family partnerships\".\nWhen men share housework and childcare, it turns out, their partners are happier.Wives of egalitarian husbands, regardless of class, report the highest levels of marital satisfaction and lowest rates of depression,and are less likely to see therapists .They are also more likely to stay fit, since they probably have more time on their hands.\nAnd the benefits for men are even greater.Men who share housework and childcare are healthier--physically and psychologically.They smoke less, drink less, and take recreational drugs less often.They are more likely to stay in shape and more likely to go to doctors for routine screenings, but less likely to use emergency rooms or miss work due to illness.\nIn both Europe and the United States,Dad is becoming the \"fun parent\".He takes the kids to the park and plays soccer with the kids; she stays home.\"What a great time we had with Dad!\" the kids announce as they burst through the kitchen door to a lunch mum prepared."

      "Andy is the most unreasonable, pigheaded life form in the world, and he makes me so angry I could scream! Of course, I love him like a brother. I have to because he is my brother. More than that, he is my twin! That's right. Andy and Amy(that's me) have the same curly  hair and dark eyes and equally stubborn character. Yet, though we may look alike, on most issues   we usually take completely opposite positions. If I say day, you can count on Andy to say night.\nJust this week, the hot topic in school was all about the PTA'S proposal  to adopt a school dress principle. Every student would be required to wear a uniform. Uniforms! Can you imagine? Oh, they would be uniforms in color. The dress style would be sort of loose and free.\nI think a dress principle is a good idea. The reason is simple. School is tough enough without worrying about looking cool every single day. The fact is, the less I have to decide first thing in the morning, the better. I also wouldn't mind not having to see guys wearing oversized jeans and shirts. And I certainly would welcome not seeing kids showing off designer clothes.\nAndy is surprised at my opinion. He says he can't believe that I would be willing to give up my all-American teenage birthright by dressing like -- well, like a typical teenager. Last night, he even dragged out Mom and Dad's high school photo albums. What a couple of peace-loving hippies  they were!\nThe vote for or against uniforms took place later that day. The results of the vote and the headmaster's decision will be announced next week. I wonder what it will be. I know how I voted, and I'm pretty sure I know how Andy voted.\nHow would you vote--for or against?"

      "More than 1.5 billion people around the world live without electricity. Finding better ways to bring light to the poor is the goal of researchers like Professor Irvine. In the late 1990s, he was working in Nepal when his return flight was canceled. A delay gave him time to take a fourteen-day hiking trip in the Himalayas.\nOne day he looked in the window of a school and noticed how dark it was. This is a common problem for millions of children around the world. Many families use kerosene oil   lamps. There are many problems with these lamps. They produce only a small amount of light. They are dangerous to breathe. And they are a big fire danger, causing many injuries and deaths each year. Kerosene costs less than other forms of lighting, but it is still costly in poor countries. Professor Irvine says many people spend over 100 dollars a year on the fuel.\nWhen he returned to Canada, he began researching ways to provide safe and clean lighting. He began experimenting with light-emitting diodes  , LEDs, at his lab. As a professor of renewable energy, he already knew about the technology. Light-emitting diodes are small glass lamps that use much less electricity than traditional bulbs   and last much longer. He used a one-watt bright white LED made in Japan. He found it on the Internet and connected it to a bicycle-powered generator  . He remembers thinking it was so bright that a child could read by the light of a single diode.\nIn 2000, after much research and many experiments, he returned to Nepal to put the systems into homes. Now the homes of 25,000 people in 51 countries have been equipped with it. \"The one-time cost of our system which basically lives forever, as well as the solar panel -- is less than one hundred dollars. So, one year of kerosene would pay for a solid-state lighting system,\" he said. Now his aim is to develop a lower-cost lighting system. In January, Irvine is leaving the University of Calgary. He has also decided to start his own company in India."

      "Popeye the Sailor first became a popular cartoon in the 1930s.The sailor in that cartoon ate lots of spinach to make him strong. People watched him, and they began to buy and eat a lot more spinach. Popeye helped sell 33 percent more spinach than before! Spinach became a necessary part of many people's diets. Even some children who hated the taste began to eat the vegetable.\nMany people thought that the iron in spinach made Popeye strong, but this is not true. Spinach does not have any more iron than any other green vegetable. People only thought spinach had a lot of iron because the people who studied the food made a mistake. In the 1890s, a group of people studied what was inside vegetables. This group said that spinach had ten times more iron than it did. The group wrote the number wrong, and everyone accepted it.\nToday, we know that the little iron there is in spinach cannot make a difference in how strong a person is. However, spinach does have something else which the body needs--folic acid.\nIt is interesting to point out that folic acid can help make a person strong. Maybe it was really the folic acid that made Popeye strong all along."

      "Lohri is an agricultural festival, filled with merrymaking. It is celebrated in the state of Punjab on the 13th of January, which falls one day before Makar Sankranti. While Lohri is essentially a Punjabi festival, it is celebrated in some other states of North India as well. In cities like Delhi, which has a large population, Lohri is celebrated to show the end of the coldest days of winter. The last week of December and the first two weeks of January are usually the coldest period in Punjab and other areas of North India. However, after Lohri, the temperature starts to rise. \nDuring the day, children go from door to door singing songs in praise of   Dulha Bhatti, the Punjabi translation of Robin Hood, a thief who helped the poor and fought for their rights. These children are given sweets and food, and sometimes they are also given money. These munchies  that the children collect are known as Lohri, and they are distributed at night during the festival. \nThe festival of Lohri is celebrated outdoors. As it is usually very cold on the 13th of January, a bonfire   is lit, and friends and  s gather around. If there has been a happy occasion in the family, like the birth of a child or a marriage, Lohri is celebrated with much greater happiness. The happy family usually hosts a party to celebrate the first Lohri of the new child or couple. \nSinging and dancing form an important part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the bhangra and gidda to the best of the dhol . Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody is happy."

      "Around the world, honeybee groups are dying in huge numbers: About one-third of nests collapse each year. For bees and the plants they pollinate   -- as well as for beekeepers, farmers, honey lovers and everyone else who appreciates this marvelous social insect -- this is a catastrophe.\nHoneybee collapse has been particularly worrying because there is no one cause, but rather a thousand little cuts. The main elements include the mixed impact of pesticides   applied to fields, as well as pesticides applied directly into nets to control bugs, pests and diseases; nutritional shortages caused by vast acreages of single-crop fields that lack diverse flowering plants; and commercial beekeeping itself, which destroys groups by moving most bees around the country multiple times each year to pollinate crops.\nThe real issue, though, is not the volume of problems, but the interactions among them. Here we find a major lesson from the bees that we ignore at our risk: the concept of synergy  , where one plus one equals three, or four, or more. A typical honeybee colony contains remains from more than 120 pesticides. Alone, each represents a benign dose  . But together they form a poisonous soup of chemicals whose interplay   can greatly reduce the effectiveness of bees' immune systems, making them easier to suffer from diseases.\nObserving the death of honeybees should warn us that our own well-being might be similarly threatened, and the widespread collapse of so many groups presents a clear message: We must demand that our regulatory authorities require studies on how exposure to low dosages of combined chemicals may affect human health before approving compounds.\nBees also provide some clues to how we may build a more collaborative relationship with the services that ecosystems can provide. Bees could offer some of the pollination service needed for agriculture. People discovered that crop harvests, and thus profits, are maximized if some cropland are left uncultivated for bees. Meanwhile a variety of wild plants means a healthier, more diverse bee population, which will then move to the planted fields next door in larger and more active numbers."

      "\"People are ruder today because they are rushed and more 'time poor' than ever before, \" says Patsy Rowe, \" Manners have fallen off the radar . \" Due to our strong attraction to electronic equipment it is a wonder more people don't wake up each morning and greet the singing birds with a complaint about the noise. Here are some examples of rudeness.\nSome people prefer to do almost everything over the internet. To them, dealing with an actual human is like an evolutionary step backward. It feels very slow because humans don, t work at 4G speeds. When you have dinner with friends, you will often notice someone paying more attention to his mobile phone. We have programmed ourselves to think that every new message brings life-changing news, so taking calls and checking our texts are more important than talking to the people we are with. What is worse, some people even tend to send anonymous  rude messages by email.\nHowever, rudeness is never acceptable, Don, t assume it is OK to be rude if the person you, re in touch with won, t recognize you. If you have something awful to say, have the courage to face the person and say it, write a letter or email and sign it, or forget it. Upsetting people with unsigned messages is cruel and disgusting.\nWe shouldn't blame technology for our shortcomings. Technology is here to help us, but we should not allow it to take over our lives. An important step is acknowledging our shortcomings. People spend a lot of time pointing out bad manners but it would be even more help if we'd publicly acknowledge good manners when we see them."

      "Little did I know that I was about to see something I would never forget at the Kentucky Association of School Administrators.\nThey introduced the young musician---Mr Patrick Henry Hughes. He was rolled onto the stage in his wheelchair and began to play the piano. His fingers danced across the keys as he made beautiful music.\nAbout ten minutes into Patrick's performance, someone came on the stage and said, \"I'd like to share a seven-minute video about Patrick Hughes.\" Then the lights were turned down.\nPatrick Henry Hughes was born with no eyes and a tightening of the joints , which left him disabled for life. However, he was fitted with artificial eyes and placed in a wheelchair. Before his first birthday, he discovered the piano. His mom said, \"I could hit any note on the piano, and within one or two tries, he'd get it.\" By his second birthday, he was playing records people asked for. His father was _ . \"We might not play baseball, but we can play music together.\"\nToday, Patrick is a junior. His father attends classes with him and he's made nearly all A's. He's also a part of a 214-member marching band . He's a blind, wheelchair-bound trumpet player; he and his father do it together. In order to attend Patrick's classes and every band practice, his father works the night shift  at United Parcel Service. Patrick says, \"My dad's my hero.\"\nOn stage, between songs, Patrick talked to the audience about his life and about how blessed he was, \"God made me blind and unable to walk. BIG DEAL! He gave me musical gifts and the great opportunity to meet new people.\"\nWhen his performance was over, the crowd rose to their feet and cheered for over five minutes."

      "Think about the last time you felt a negative emotion--like stress, anger, or frustration. What was going through your mind as you were going through that negativity? Was your mind cluttered with   different kinds of thoughts? Or was it paralyzed, unable to think?\nThe next time you find yourself in the middle of a very stressful time, or you feel angry or frustrated, stop. Yes, that's right, stop. Whatever you're doing, stop and sit for one minute. While you're sitting there, completely _ yourself in the negative emotion.\nAllow that emotion to consume you. Allow yourself one minute to truly feel that emotion. Don't cheat yourself here. Take the entire minute--but only one minute--to do nothing else but feel that emotion.\nWhen the minute is over, ask yourself, \"Am I willing to keep holding on to this negative emotion as I go through the rest of the day?\"\nOnce you've allowed yourself to be totally immersed in the emotion and really feel it, you will be surprised to find that the emotion clears rather quickly.\nIf you feel you need to hold on to the emotion for a little longer, that is OK. Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.\nWhen you feel you've had enough of the emotion, ask yourself if you're willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest of the day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativity with your breath.\nThis exercise seems simple--almost too simple. But, it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be truly felt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and trying not to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by giving it the space and attention it needs. When you immerse yourself in the emotion, and realize that it is only emotion, it loses its control. You can clear your head and proceed with your task."

      "Attention to detail is something everyone can and should do -- especially in tight job market. Bob Crossley, a human-resources expert notices this in the job applications that come across his desk every day. \"It's amazing how many candidates _ themselves,\" he says.\n\"Resumes  arrive with faults. Some candidates don't bother to spell the company's name correctly. Once I see a mistake, I cross out the candidates,\" Crossley concludes. \"If they cannot take care of these details, why should we trust them with a job?\"\nCan we pay too much attention to details? Perfectionists struggle over little things at the cost of something larger they work toward. \"To keep from losing the forest for the trees,\" says Charles Garfield, the professor at the University of California, San Francisco, \"We must constantly ask ourselves how the details we're working on fit into the larger picture. If they don't, we should drop them and move to something else.\"\nGarfield compares this process to his work as a computer scientist at NASA. \"The Apollo II moon launch was slightly off course 90 percent of the time,\" says Garfield. \"But a successful landing was still likely because we knew the exact position of our goal. This allowed us to make adjustments as necessary.\" Knowing where to go helps us judge the importance of every task we undertake.\nToo often we believe what accounts for others' success is some special secret or a lucky break. But rarely is success so mysterious. Again and again, we see that by doing little things within our grasp well, large rewards follow."

      "I am 26. I'm clear that I'm never going to catch up with Mother Teresa. But I want to do something to help people every single day like her.\nEverybody thinks we just serve food and soda. The safety training is serious and stressful. Caring for 49 people in a business class in 90 minutes is not easy. I had a roommate who was a waitress; she just left a candle and a table cloth burning, and I used a fire extinguisher   to put out the fire. If something goes bad at her job, she calls the police. But if something happens up in the air, it's up to us.\nI'm single and have no kids. I've flown every Christmas since 1995. If I fly, someone else can be with their kids. Christmas in an airport can be depressing, but it's the little things that make a difference.\n _ . It's hard to put on a smile and just pretend everything is great when it isn't. I've seen co-workers lose a family member the day before a trip and just pull themselves together (take control of their feelings and believe in a calm way).

You can't wait to turn off the flight attendant's voice and get something to eat without anyone saying \"Excuse me.\"\nSometimes I go all day and never hear a \"please\" or a \"thank you.\" When you say thank you, it's huge. It makes us feel like you actually see us as fellow humans. We're up there together at a height of 30,000 feet, enjoying the miracle   of the modern flight."

      "Gossip moves so quickly that few people have time to cover their ears, even if they want to.\n\"I hate it when others gossip about me,\" said Mandy Miraglia, 16, a high school student from California, \"but to be honest, gossip about my friends makes me feel I am trusted and belong to the group.\" Miraglia is not the only person feeling like that.\nGossip has long been looked down on as little more than nonsense and bad manners. But recent research has shown that gossip has many positive effects on your social life.\n\"There has been a trend among people to dislike gossip,\" said David Sloan Wilson, Professor from the State University of New York in Binghamton, US, \"but gossip appears to be a very important form of behavior in a group of friends, defining their group membership.\"\nFor 18 months, Kevin Kniffin, from the University of Wisconsin, US, researched the behavior of 50 people. He found that gossip levels peaked when a sports team included a _ , someone who regularly missed practices or showed up late. Other members of the team would soon start to joke about the slacker's shortcomings behind his back, because they thought they were bad for the whole team.\nGossip about the mistakes of senior members helps newcomers rebuild their confidence after a failure.\nIt also helps relieve social and professional anxiety. Long-term studies show that people around the world devote from a fifth to two-thirds or more of their daily conversation to gossip, and men appear to be just as eager for gossip as women.\nIt is hard to judge gossip, but it is more powerful than you think."

      "Students in American schools learn from an early age to give presentations  as part of their regular classroom activities. Children as young as five years old often give brief talks about objects they bring in to school - called \"show and tell,\" and this training is a basis for later public speaking. Even so, many native English-speaking adults are afraid to speak or give presentations in front of a large group.\nSpeaking English in public meetings is necessary for many students and employees. The best way to improve is to practice public speaking in a friendly environment. Learners need to receive feedback about what they are doing well and about their mistakes. One group that gives members the chance to practice is Toastmasters. Toastmasters is an international organization that holds weekly meetings. At the meetings, members each give a speech and give others advice about their speeches and speaking style.\nCharles LeBeau is a public speaking professor and consultant. He began his career in Japan in 1982. Currently, he teaches at two universities and at the Toshiba International Training Center. He has also written books on the subject.\nEnglish language learners around the world use his book Speaking of Speech. Speaking of Speech tells about a method of teaching public speaking for non-native speakers. Mr. LeBeau says a simple approach helps English learners.\n\"The approach that I've taken is to simplify and break it down. First if we look at a presentation, what's going on, there are basically three messages that the presenter is giving the audience, all simultaneously . There's what I call the physical message. Physical message is basically body language. It's the way that my body, as a speaker, is talking to the audience. And then there's also the visual message. The visual messages are the slides that we now make and show the audience. The third message is the story message. The story message is the content of our presentation. So another way we can think of the story messages is that it's the verbal message, and it's what we say to the audience. The story message also includes how we organize our ideas to present to the audience,\" LeBeau said."

      "Hundreds of thousands of women develop breo bravely battle the disease. However, last month, Soraya Lamilla died, after givinast cancer  each year. Latino musician Soraya was among those women who countless other women hope for recovery. She was 37. Soraya Lamilla was born in the state of New Jersey in 1969. Her parents had come to the United States from Colombia. Soraya discovered her interest in music early in life. She began studying the guitar when she was five. She was playing the violin at the age of eight. Her family often traveled between Colombia and the United States. Soraya's music was a mix of those cultures. In fact, she released both Spanish and English versions of her first two albums. This Latin Grammy winner had big plans for her musical career in June of 2000. She had released her third album and was about to launch a two-year tour to promote it. But when she found a lump  in her breast, none of those plans mattered. She had a new mission --to take care of her health and help other women understand the cancer that had already taken her mother, aunt and grandmother. Soraya began to work as a spokeswoman for the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, giving hope to women who, like herself, suffered from this illness. Soraya also spent much of her time spreading the message of the importance of breast examination and treatment. In a letter to her fans posted on her Internet site, Soraya wrote, \"I have not lost this battle, because I know the fight was not in vain. Instead, it will help end a larger battle: early detection to prevent this terrible disease.\""

      "Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life.Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity   boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship.The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Fair, who wrote that widows and widowers   were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers.Studies since then suggest that marriage could and as much as seven years to a man's life and two to a woman's.The effect holds for all rouses of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.\nEven if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate.Linda Waite from the University of Chicago has found that .I married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart.Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn't smoke.There's a  _ , however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse's death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems.\nEven so, the odds favour marriage.In a 30 - year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.\nSo how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio - economic factors, health - service provision, emotional support and other more physiological mechanisms.For example, social contact can boost development of die brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression ?later in life.People in supportive relationships may handle stress better.Then there are the psychological 9 benefits of a supportive partner.\nA life partner, children and good friends arc all recommended if you aim to live to 100.The ultimate  social network is still being mapped out, hut Christakis says: \"People are interconnected, so their health\nis interconnected."

      "Being a victim of schoolyard violence can help pupils learn how to manage argument and develop their ability to get along with others, it was claimed.\nHelene Guldberg, associate lecturer in child development at the Open University, said trying to stop the \"supposedly terrible dangers of bullying \" can do more harm than good. She insisted teachers should not break up \"everyday playground argument\", saying children should be left to deal with it themselves.\nIn an on-line article, Dr. Guldberg said that bullying was \"an experience that children need to develop\". But the comments were strongly criticized by anti-bullying campaigners.\nAccording to official figures, almost half of children claim they are bullied at school. One of the biggest studies of its kind by Ofsted showed 48 percent of young people had been orally or physically  _ in the last year. It comes despite a number of government measures designed to crack down on the threats.\nWriting on a website, Dr. Guldberg said: \"Teachers are increasingly taking the task of looking after children's health and well-being rather than being allowed to get on with the task of educating them. Children are encouraged to assume their relationships with other children are damaging, and encouraged to look upon their classmates with suspicion.\" She added: \"If we treat children as if they cannot possibly cope with hurtful experiences, then we will likely to weaken their confidence and make them less likely to cope with difficult events in the future. In effect, we will prevent them from growing up.\"\nThe comments echo  remarks made by teachers in recent years who claim the education system has been too focused on developing children's social skills at the expense of academic learning. But Sue Steel, national manager of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said: \"Children who are being bullied often find it difficult to tell anyone. Teachers can help by giving appropriate attention.\""

      "Damage to Ozone layer Gets Worse\n    In the middle of winter, when snow is falling in many parts of theprefix = st1 /United States, scientists have sounded a warning to people who plan to spend many hours in the sun this summer. The warning is: The sun's summertime rays  are more dangerous than once thought.\n    A team of scientists from 80 nations recently reported to the United Nations that a layer  of ozone   in the atmosphere, which protects humans from harmful levels of ultraviolet  radiation, will be thinner over the United States this summer. The thinner layer allows more ultraviolet rays from the sun to reach Earth. The extra amount of ultraviolet radiation could cause an increase in the number of cases of skin cancer.\n    Scientists first became concerned about the ozone layer in the mid-1980s when a hole was discovered in the layer above Antarctica during the winter. The hole was caused by chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners. When these chemicals are sent out into the atmosphere, they produce gases that destroy the ozone.\n    Concern about the protective ozone layer rose more recently when data  from satellites and ground stations showed that ozone levels were dropping over areas other than Antarctica. Low ozone levels were recorded in the spring and summer over the United Statesand over other populated areas in the world.\n    Although many countries have already begun stopping the use of ozone destroying chemicals, the new findings are expected to advance the timetable for a total ban  of the chemicals."

      "When you first meet a disabled person, what is your first reaction? Curiosity? Sympathy? If you experience any of these emotions, you are not alone.Chances are that you don't regularly associate with someone who is disabled.Here are four points to keep in mind if you should happen to meet a disabled person.\nDisabled people can lead active lives\nWith few exceptions, a disability does not prevent someone from working, raising a family, or taking part in social activities.Many sports and recreation programs have been adapted to a person with a disability.Instead of concentrating on the disability, look at the person the same way you would look at any normal person.\nIt's all right to ask questions\nMany people are afraid of offending someone by asking about their disability.When meeting them for the first time, it's natural to be curious about who he or she is, and where they're from.Asking questions is usually acceptable, as long as you use common sense.Don't, for example, ask a blind person how he feeds and bathes himself.\nOffer help when necessary\nYou see a woman in a wheelchair having trouble entering a building.It's usually appropriate to lend a hand if someone is having obvious difficulty, but keep in mind that not everyone will be willing to accept your help.Unless the woman in the wheelchair is in danger, you do your part.\nRemember that we all have obstacles to overcome\nNo matter who we are, each of us has a weakness or challenge to face.Like you, a disabled person would much rather be accepted for who they are, rather than be pitied.Many friends have said to me, \"I often forget that you are blind.\" To me, that is the top compliment."

      "Picking a university is a tense period of asking yourself which institution is most relevant. That's why university rankings play such a vital role in students searching for their next academic direction. Rankings are also an inescapable part of the reputation and brand image of universities. \"No university website is complete without the claim to be in the top 100 for something or other,\" reported the BBC. The reason is simple: Rankings help them to attract students, staff and research investment.\nCurrently there are numbers of university rankings, and each has its own list of criteria. But the main categories are the same: academic reputation, graduates' performance and faculty resources.\nHowever, experts point out the ranking process isn't entirely reliable. Mark Kantrowitz, a US financial aid researcher, said university rankings were mostly just for show. He wrote in The New York Times. \"It may give your parents better bragging rights, but that's about it.\"\nMoreover, it's not difficult to see the limitations of university rankings. Many rankings focus on the number of times research work is cited   by other researchers. _ helps British and US universities to dominate global rankings because English is the favored language of academia, John O'Leary, a member of the QS academic advisory board, told The Gunrdian. Also, rankings such as QS mainly focus on the qualities of the university rather than its students. \"Any university ranking is likely to help students make better decisions about where to study, but the need to balance them with other more human factors is also important,\" said Phil Moss, an education and admissions consultant. \"Advice from graduates or current students can be as valuable in providing a genuine insight into the experience or quality of a particular degree program. It can also add an element that rankings can never convey -- the actual emotion of a university experience.\""

      "Pulling luggage through the airport can be a pain, as any frequent traveler will tell you. A new suitcase called only \"Hop\" is looking to change all of that, though, using signals from your cell phone to go hands-free. \nAccording to Hop's official website, the suitcase uses threesensors  to identify the Bluetoothsignal from your phone and pick you out of a crowd. Once it's done that, a microprocessor not only figures out Hop's position as it relates to your phone, but controls the twocaterpillar tracks  in the bottom of the unit to get it moving. Hop follows behind the user at a constant distance, so you don't have to worry about it \"stepping\" on your heels, so to speak. If it loses the signal it's following, your phone will vibrate, letting you know that your poor suitcase is lost and alone in a sea of strange people.\nWe can see Hop in action in the video below, and we have to say that it looks like a great little device. There's just one problem: it looks as if you'll have to walk at a  ly slow pace to keep the suitcase from losing the signal. Since a walk through an airport is rarely a leisurely experience, that could potentially cause troubles. Also, don't expect TSA agents to just smile and wave as you walk through security with a remote-controlled suitcase tailing you.\nStill, the idea behind Hop is really cool, and we're willing to believe that there are some frequent flyers who would like to put down some money for it right this instant. However, this is just a model at the moment, so don't expect it to be available for sale anytime soon (if it ever is, for that matter). Would you purchase one of these if Hop ever became available commercially?"

      "Everybody knows that words can carry messages. People communicate with words. Books, magazines, TV, radio and films all help us to communicate with others. They all help us to know what is going on in the world and what other people are thinking about.\nDo you think you can communicate without words? A smile on your face shows you are happy or friendly. Tears in your eyes tell others that you are sad. When you put up your hand in class, the teacher knows you want to say something or ask a question. You shake your head, and people know you are saying \"No\". You nod and people know you are saying \"Yes\".\nOther things can also carry messages. For example, a sign at the bus stop helps you to know which bus to take. A sign on the wall of your school helps you to find the library. Signs with arrows on doors tell you where to go in or out. Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of signs around you and that you receive messages from them all the time?\nPeople can communicate in many ways without words. For example, an artist can use his drawings to tell about beautiful mountains, about the sea and many other things."

      "Dear Editor,\n  I used to be a doctor in the children's department of a hospital. Sometimes I treated children who had been poisoned by medicine for older family members. The children didn't know the medicine was dangerous; they just knew it tasted sweet. Children easily open the bottle that we now use in China.\n  Some days ago I talked about medicines with an American. He showed me a sort of plastic bottle. The design was quite simple and I'm sure our Chinese factories could produce these bottles. The top of the bottle licks but can be opened by pressing down on it while turning. This is difficult for most young children to do, though grown-ups can open these bottles very easily.\n  I'm certain that the expense of making such tops would be very small. As a doctor, I'd love to see this done. And most parents would be grateful .\n                                                              Sincerely yours, \n                                                              Li Hua"

You see, in America, many people often spend their free time sitting on a couch  watching TV. As there are many channels to choose, the TV can be quite interesting and very addictive . One may sit and watch TV for hour and hour without stop! Well, these people who do nothing all day except watching TV are called couch-potatoes.\nIn America, when one watches TV, he is most often sitting on a couch. While watching TV, most of these people look so frozen that they almost look dead! Everyone is sitting still  with eyes looking right into the same black box. Also because these people are addictive to TV, they don't take exercise and usually get very fat. So in many ways, these people look like real potatoes! Well, because they look so still and fat, and watch TV on a couch, they are all called couch-potatoes. Now you know what couch-potato means.

      "We are fortunate to be living in a time when all people have the ability to access any knowledge they desire. This digital society that we live in affords us opportunities that our ancestor only dreamed of having. _ \nIn the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.\nIn the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.\nAccess to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales. A person in America can purchase a product from a person in Germany, without leaving home.\nBecause of the digital society we live in our children can learn about anything they are interested in. When they ask you what the dinosaurs ate, you can look it up, and tell them the answer. Because of this people will be smarter in the future, and technology will only improve."

I always spoke, but the only answer I ever got was a hello from a four-year-old girl. One day when I returned, they were just coming back to their apartment and the little girl was holding the door in the hall open for the others. I remained in the car doing unnecessary things. The parents were telling her to hurry. I looked up and saw the little girl was still holding the door open, waiting for me. I hurried as much as I could and thanked her. She was smiling from ear to ear.\nThat afternoon I was at the K-Mart and saw a white teddy bear. I thought of the little girl and said to myself, \"I bet she would like it.\" So I bought it for her.\nThe next day there was a knock on the door and it was the little girl and her father. She was so proud of her bear and thanked me. Then I noticed her mother and the other children were there in the hall, too.\nNow when we meet in the hall, we all speak in a friendly manner. Last night we had about four inches of snow. The temperature was below zero. When I opened the outside door, there was my car with all the snow removed. The man next door was the only person I knew in the whole building, so when I saw him the next day, I asked him if he was the nice person that removed the snow. He said NO. He wanted to, but his wife said she wanted to do it.\nIsn't it amazing that the small kind act of a four-year-old girl can change so many things for the better?"

      "Today, many people are too busy to spend enough time with their family. What are the causes of this phenomenon and what problems has it brought to families and society as a whole?\nIn this day and age, the human society is progressing rapidly on various aspects. Many modern technologies were invented by human such as cars, computers and Internet. But advances in technology lead to our pace of life much faster than before. People have not enough time with their family.\nIt is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time. Moreover, this is especially true when we consider the fact that the global financial crisis in recent years has led many people to fear losing their job, and the significant rising costs of life which need people to work harder than before. Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world. For example, my friend often holds a meeting at middle-night with his colleague who stays in the US and he still needs to work at daytime.\nIn my opinion, the impact of this phenomenon on families and society is profound. People do not have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth. Furthermore, the increasingly over-speed lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of illness. More instances about employee's sudden death at his/her workplace are reported by media and we must make reflection.\nIn brief, I pen down saying that people should spend more time with their family because families are the foundation of the society. This is no longer a problem for individual families, but for society as a whole."

      "Hockerill's Suggestion\nCaught between the rising cost of university tuition in England and the falling percentage of applicants offered places, one British school is giving its students some surprising advice.\nBy any measure HockerilI is one of the most successful schools in Britain. Named last month as one of the government's flagship academies, its students regularly come at or near the top of exam results for the entire country, outperforming such famous names as Eton or Harrow. But unlike those private schools, where fees can exceed PS28, 000 or PS45, 000 a year, Hockerill, in the Hertfordshire town, is a state comprehensive, which charges no tuition fees and is forbidden from selecting its students on the basis of academic ability. And while a third of Hockerill's 830 students are boarders, they are chosen on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.\nSo when the school's principal heard of government plans to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9, 000 a year, he decided to make use of the school's international focus. urging his students to apply to universities abroad and hiring a counselor  to help the students who want to apply to universities in countries whose fees are cheaper. \"If you can get into a university in France and pay about PS180 a year for an education at one of the best institutions in the world, why would you pay PS9, 000 a year in Britain?\" the principal asked.\nPupils at Hockerill are offered a choice of seven foreign languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese or Mandarin. History and geography classes are taught exclusively in French or German. But with English rapidly becoming the international language of education, even less linguistically flexible students soon find that going abroad can save them money while enhancing the quality of their education.\n\"Our students can get to Maastricht in Holland by train more quickly than they can get to Lees from London,\" the principal said. Just over the border from Germany and Belgium, Maastricht University offers a highly regarded undergraduate program taught in English. Tuition fees are about PS1, 430, a year. Germany and France offer even greater savings."

      "\"Birds are not as loyal to their partners as you might think, with divorce, child abandonment and remarriage a common part of birds' life,\" a new book has shown. Author and biology professor Bridge Stutchbury, _ the love-bird belief that birds pair up for life. \"In terms of the top 10 beliefs about birds, the lasting pair bonds that we think about, do occur in some birds, but in most of the little songbirds that we studied, no,\" the professor from York University in Toronto said. The divorce rate among greater flamingos is 99 percent.\nStutchbury's book, The Private Lives of Birds, based on 20 years of research from radio filming and DNA testing shows male Acadian flycatchers fertilize  females far away from their home nests, \" The main discovery is that so many birds do divorce for what humans would describe as selfish reasons,\" Professor Stutchbury said. She noted that females may seek out males that are more colorful and better singers, or look to \"step up in the world\" and move to areas that are safer and have more food. \"Females are looking for the highest quality male so that their children will be of high quality,\" she added.\nProfessor Stutchbury said shorter summers may drive females to leave their nests before their young are fully grown up so they can quickly find new mates  and lay more eggs, leaving the males to feed the hungry chicks on their own.\nMales can double their success in producing children by fertilizing neighboring females, but only \"mates\" care for the young, and some are none the wiser. \"  They can't tell when the egg comes out and whether it's theirs or not,\" She said. \"They have no way to know.\"\nDivorce is surprisingly common among birds, and most live with one partner for only a few months or years. Divorce rates range from 99 percent in the greater flamingo to zero in the wandering albatross ."

      "Police in prefix = st1 /Hangzhouyesterday claimed to have arrested 11 people suspected of running an illegal gambling network.  \n\"The network acted as a bridge between Chinese gamblers and overseas casinos ,\" said Wu Jun, spokesman for the public security bureau of Xiaoshan district, Hangzhou. \"About 80 percent of the gamblers are local businessmen, and chances are that the money they bet came from their companies' accounts,\" Wu said. The underground gambling network was set up by a wealthy local businessman surnamed Li last year, he said. The gamblers could view real-time images of a casino in Philippinesvia the website and place bets through the agent's account.  \nLi registered with the website after coughing up a 5-million-yuan deposit last March. Every time a gambler won, 17% of the winning amount would go to the website as a fee. Li received 10% of the winnings as  _ , while the person who introduced the gambler to the website got a 7-percent commission.  \nLi ran the gambling network under a pyramid scheme. Gamblers were encouraged to bring in more people to join the website's network in order to earn more commission.  \n\"Li had provided a convenient but illegal platform for wealthy businessmen, who wanted to gamble,\" Wu said. \"Otherwise they had to travel all the way to Macaoto do so.\" Under the current law, gambling is prohibited all overChina, exceptMacao. \"Setting up the gambling network is the stupidest thing I've ever done,\" Li said. \"The whole thing started as a joke, but the joke went too far,\" he added. \"I was not short of money, I was just being greedy.\"  \nAccording to Wu, the police uncovered the illegal network while investigating a local businessman, who fled without paying banks \"hundreds of millions of yuan\" worth of debt. The cops later discovered the man lost most of the bank's money in Li's virtual casino."

After the call, my whole body became feverish and panicky. The time from his call to the next morning seemed like years. The whole night, I could not sleep with many _ in mind. One of them was to call the principal with regret and tell him that I could not come. Finally, I gathered some courage. I thought, \"If I miss this opportunity, surely the school will never invite me again to any of their programs.\"\nI reached the school in time. Before my turn came, my whole body was trembling. When my turn came and I started speaking, my heartbeat increased and my mouth went dry. I wasn't even able to read the written speech properly. I was not aware of where I was standing and what I was reading. That was the day when I realized my biggest weakness, Public Speaking.\nAfter my speech, I met with the principal and explained what happened to me. He told me that this happens to everyone. Even great speaker, faced the same things when they started. He suggested that I come again next time.\nAround one month later, I was invited to refer to a topic on Motivation. This time I was feeling comfortable. My speech was not only appreciated by the principal as well as the teachers, because I was able to get my idea across to them. They encouraged and praised my efforts.\nAfter delivering is successfully, I became more confident .l said to myself, \"If I can speak in front of such a learned audience, like the principal who educates others, I can now speak in front of others too.\"\nI started delivering lectures in my plant, on various topics like Self Motivation, Personality Development, Personal Excellence, Spoken English and Presentation Skills. This has become a passion for me. I learned that everything is possible if we have the courage to take the first step."

I would have liked to leave a legacy   of words explaining what it has meant to have twins.

After the twins' birth I did have something to write about, but I found myself facing not a pen and paper but milk bottles.\nSome nights, friends would visit. They would leave at 11 p.m., heading for bed, and for us the night was only just beginning. With twins, there is really no night. Each feeding lasts a long time. At 1:00 a.m., each of them would begin crying from hunger. At 4:00am, when I finally put them down, I felt exhausted.\nTwo years have passed since then and we've managed to live through it all.

      "Bali is an Indonesia island that is rich in indigenous   culture. A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the \"now\". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be \"just like Bali\". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.\nOne factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.\nBalinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called \"Hindu Darma\". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.\nIn spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.\nAnother remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese."

      "English nowadays is widely used in science, business, the media and popular culture. For example, 80% of e-mails on the internet are in English. But where will English be at the end of the 21stcentury?\nOne view is that English is going to become even more important as a global language, being most widely used in trade and media while some other languages will become less important or just disappear. Another view is that English is already breaking up into several separate languages. There are already dictionaries of the \"New Englishes\", such as Australian English, full of words that a British English speaker would not recognize.\nHopefully, neither of these things will happen. Although different varieties of English will continue to develop around the world, standard English will survive for international       communication. However, it is impossible for one language to totally control the world. Already, other languages are fighting back against the control of English on the net. Governments around the world are also starting to protect smaller languages and recognize the importance of keeping a variety of cultures and languages. English will probably stay in control for a long time, but it certainly won't become the only language in the world."

      "It would be hard to argue that there is anyone more powerful in Hollywood today than Steven Spielberg. Since his first major success Jaws in 1975, he has made one hit movie after another. These include the wildly popular series Indiana Jones, Jaws and ET.\nThose films are fun and lighthearted. But Steven Spielberg has also made serious films that were well received by critics   and movie audiences alike. The movie Saving Private Ryan is a good example. It is an American war movie in the traditional sense. But, the director's close attention to detail and historical facts also increased public interest in America's efforts during World War Two.\nThe film Schindler's List also takes place during World War Two. It tells the powerful story of a German businessman who worked to save Jews from Nazi Germany.\nSteven Spielberg was born in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946.His mother owned a restaurant and was also a musician. His father was an electrical engineer. Steven started making movies while he was growing up. He required his family and friends to pay twentyfive cents to see his films when they were completed. Steven Spielberg said this experience led him to produce the film Super Eight. It tells about a group of teenagers who join together to make a movie and uncover a mystery in the process.\nSteven Spielberg is one of the top directors in the film industry and also has many fans in China. When asked about the secret of his success, Steven Spielberg said that he owes much of his success and happiness to his wife and children. He met Cate Capshaw, who is an actress, when he was working on one of his films. After that it still took seven years before they finally got married. The couple has seven children in all."

      "Water goes around and around Earth in a never ending journey called the water cycle . The sun heats up lakes, oceans, and other wet places on Earth. When the water gets warm enough, it changes into vapour. Plants also give off lots of water vapour. Some of this water vapour cools off high in the sky and becomes clouds. Then it falls back to Earth in a new place as rain or snow. This cycle happens over and over again.\nThe ground can absorb water like a sponge  . If you could see this groundwater, it wouldn't look like a lake or river. The groundwater is mixed in with the rocks and sand that lie in layers  below Earth's surface.\nGroundwater moves along slowly. How slowly? Maybe 1.5 kilometres in one century. Some of this water has been underground for thousands of years. And once groundwater is pumpedout of the ground from a deep well  by people, it may take hundreds of years for another water to take its place."

      "All Eskimos live most of their lives close to sea or fresh water. They may follow game inland for several hundred miles, but they always return to the shores of rivers, lakes, or seas. Eskimo land has a bare look. Large rocks, pebbles, and sand cover much of the surface. Plants called lichen   grow on the rocks, and where there is enough soil, grass, flowers, and even small bushes manage to live. No trees can grow on Eskimo land, so geographers sometimes call it the Arctic plains. There are some animals in Eskimo land, such as rabbits, which eat the plants. Other animals, like the white fox and the gray wolf, eat the rabbits. The Eskimo is a meat-eater, too, and may even eat a wolf when food is scarce.\nThe Eskimo year has two main parts: a long, cold winter and a short, cool summer. Spring and fall are almost too short to be noticed. Summer is the best time, as food is usually plentiful. But it is also the time when Eskimos are very busy. Winter is never far away, and the men must bring home extra meat for the women to prepare and store, for seldom can enough animals be killed in winter to feed a family.\nThe Far North is sometimes called the land of the midnight sun. This is true in the middle of summer, for between April 21st and August 21st the sun never sets in Northern Greenland. But in midwinter the Far North is a land with no sunshine at all. Around Oct. 21st the Eskimos of Northern Greenland see the sun set directly south of them, and they don't see it again until February 22nd. All places on earth get about the same amount of daylight during a year. As a result, if summer is lighter, winter has to be darker.\nWinter nights in the Far North are seldom _ . As in the rest of the world, the stars and moon provide a little light. The northern lights also help the Eskimo to see. And with the ground covered with snow, even a little light is reflected back to the Eskimo's eyes."

      "When I recall my experiences of feeling heard and deeply understood by someone, I know how much the experiences helped me to cope With   whatever I was dealing with at the time. Caring people who I have turned to in difficult times helped me the most by listening and asking about my feelings.\nDuring one of my volunteer jobs at a local HIV and cancer clinic, I found the helpfulness of empathic   listening. As a volunteer I was providing emotional support for people with health related problems. Empathic listening really made a difference on how patients felt about their health problems. By sharing about their pain and suffering and my willingness to listen, they felt less alone.\nWe can make life easier for each other by becoming a better listener and encouraging each other to share our feelings. We can become a better listener by avoiding giving advice and trying to solve problems unless we are asked to do so. Pressuring others to solve their life problems--\"our ways\"-- is not helpful. Most people intuitively   know how to solve their own problems. As a listener it's important to be patient and not to interrupt the speaker. Let them know it's OK to talk about their feelings and support them in feeling their feelings.\nWhen one neither shares nor reaches out for support, he or she can remain a lonely mystery. Life can feel lonely when one keeps everything inside. Feeling alone with life problems can be worse than the problem itself. When we let a caring person listen to our life struggle, we will no longer feel alone with our struggle. Don't be afraid to ask your loved ones to take time to hear you out .Sometimes you have to ask for it. People cannot read your mind. Confiding in others can have a positive effect on our mood."

      "Dear editor,\n    I am Paul , a senior English teacher in Linchuan No. 1 Middle School in Jiangxi Province , China. This letter is written to ask for your opinion.\n    The other day, I met with a multiple - choice exercise. We teachers argued heatedly with each other over its answer. Unfortunately, neither side could convince the other. The sentence is to be attached at the end of the letter. There is no doubt that the reference answer C is correct. But I don't  think it is the only answer. Personally, I do think A is also a reasonable choice in sense as well as in grammar, if the case is treated from another aspect.                                 \n    What puzzles me is why we should deal with so many multiple - choice exercises with not rigorous enough reference keys. But being a teacher, it's very important and necessary to make it clear to students which answer is correct, which is more appropriate, and which is the best one. Regrettably, Multiple - choice test, which is a bit old - fashioned in western countries, seems to be quite popular and covers a rather high percentage in all sorts of English tests in China, especially in NMET.\n    Personally speaking, I don't think multiple - choice test form making up more than 75 percent of the total scores in college entrance examination is a very good and effective testing method. Instead, more subjective testing forms depending on one's own thinking and his ability to use the language like key words falling, question answering, paragraph or passage summarizing, English - Chinese or Chinese - English inter - translation, etc. should be applied to English proficiency tests. Through the test forms mentioned above, students' ability to use the language will be better developed. Consequently, more advanced and outstanding English learners could be picked out. In fact, a test paper focusing on multiple - choice test influences, in a sense, students to form their own language thinking, which hinders the development of their language ability as well. Do you think so?\n    I am looking forward to your authoritative opinion. Thanks.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Liao"

      "The Inspiration\n         Greeks in ancient times believed in many deities  or gods. One way they showed their devotion to gods was to build temples in their honor.\n         A Shaky Start\n         The Greeks were building the original Parthenon in about 480 B.C. when the Persians captured Athens. The Greeks swore an oath  called \"The Oath of Plateau\". They swore to fight to death. They also vowed never to rebuild the city's monuments. The Greeks survived the invasion. They used the remains of the monuments to build a defensive wall around the city. After thirty years' peace, the Greeks broke their oath. Their ruler, Pericles, ordered the rebuilding of Athens. They started work on Parthenon.\n         Fit for a Godness\n         The Greeks used expensive white marble to build the Parthenon. The Parthenon was 60 feet high and was surrounded by 46 tall Doric columns. The temple was decorated with many sculptures. A continuous sculpture formed a border around the outside of the building. This horizontal band is called a frieze. Only 325 feet of the original 525 feet of the frieze still exist. A huge 40-foot gilt and ivory statue of Athena was placed inside the temple.\n         Changes in Purpose\n         Over time, many different groups of people used the Parthenon. It was first a Greek temple. Then in the sixth century, Christians made it a church. Later, in the 1400s, Muslins used it as a mosque. At one point, it was nearly destroyed by war. Turkish invaders used it to store ammunition. An explosion destroyed the inside of the building.\n         The Parthenon stands as a ruin today. Pollution has harmed the outside. Despite the changes over time, the Parthenon remains one of the most famous buildings in the world."

      "Maybe ten-year-old Elizabeth put it best when she said to her father, \"But, Dad, you can't be healthy if you're dead.\"\nDad, in a hurry to get home before dark so he could go for a run, had forgotten to wear his safety belt--a mistake 75% of the US population make every day. The big question is why.\nThere have been many myths about safety belts ever since their first appearance in cars some forty years ago. The following are three of the most common.\nMyth Number One: It's best to be \"thrown clear\" of a serious accident.\nTruth: Sorry, but any accident serious enough to \"throw you clear\" is also going to be serious enough to give you a very bad landing. And chances are that you'll have traveled through a wind shield  or door to do it. Studies show that chances of dying after a car accident are twenty-five times greater in cases where people are \"thrown clear\".\nMyth Number Two: Safety belts \"trap\" people in cars that are burning or sinking in water.\nTruth: Sorry again, but studies show that people knocked unconscious  due to not wearing safety belts have a greater chance of dying in these accidents. People wearing safety belts are usually protected to the point of having a clear head to free themselves from such dangerous situations, not to be trapped in them.\nMyth Number Three: Safety belts aren't needed at speeds of less than 30 miles per hour.\nTruth: When two cars traveling at 30 mph hit each other, an unbelted driver would meet the windshield with a force equal to diving headfirst into the ground from a height of 10 meters."

      "One cold January evening in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, America, I went with my father on an oil burner service call. My father was in his forties at that time and I was about twelve years old. He was always working hard trying to support us seven kids. I enjoyed hanging out with him whenever I could -- he taught me so much.\nWe arrived at the call and after walking over snow and ice, we knocked on the customer's door. A senior citizen opened the door and let us into her very cold home. She was wearing an old, worn-out brown coat that went down to her knees. On her head, covering her gray hair, was an old and worn hat. The home wasn't furnished very well and was quite dark, except for a single light bulb over the dining room table. Below the light was an older man counting change from several old coffee cans. He looked up at us as we passed by to get to the kitchen where my dad would fix the oil burner. He didn't say anything. He just looked up at us. He couldn't speak English, nor could his wife. She only pointed to the kitchen and smiled at us.\nAfter a short while, my father had the heater up and running, and it began to heat their cold home. The lady asked my dad in poor English how much she owed him for fixing the heater. My dad looked around the house and said that he had to go out to the truck and write the bill.\nOnce in the truck he marked the bill \"no answer at home, no charge\", so they wouldn't be charged for his work. He looked over at me and said, \"He was counting his change to pay me. They need their money more than I do.\"\nAs usual, my father taught me something important that time, which was to be kind to the poor."

      "Since the beginning of time, man has been interested in the moon.The Romans designed a special day to show admiration and respect to the moon.They called it \"Monday\", or \"Monday\", as we know it today.Later, the great mind of Leonardo da Vinci studied the moon and designed a machine to carry a human to the moon.Leonardo said that one day a great machine bird would take a person to the moon and bring great honour to the home where it was born.\n         Four and a half centuries later, Leonardo's idea was realized.Apollo II took three Americans Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong to the moon.The mission   did fill the whole world with great surprise, as Leonardo had said it would.Numerous (many) essays, articles, and books were written about man's first moon mission.But perhaps the most interesting story was one written before the event over 100 years before.\n         In 1865, French author Jules Verne wrote a story about the first journey to the moon.His story was very similar to the 1969 Apollo II mission.\n         Verne's spacecraft also contained three men--two Americans and a Frenchman.The spacecraft was described as being almost the same size as Apollo II.The launch   site in Verne's story was also in Florida.The spacecraft in Verne's story was named the \"Columbiad\".The Apollo II command ship was called \"Columbia\".His account description of sending the spacecraft into the space could easily have been written about how Apollo II was sent into the space.\n         Verne's story was the same as the actual event in several other respects  .The speed of Verne's spacecraft was 36,000 feet per second; Apollo's was 35,533 feet per second.Verne's spacecraft took 97 hours to reach the moon; Apollo's time was 103 hours.Like Apollo's spacemen, Verne's spacemen took pictures of the moon's surface, relaxed on their seats, cooked with gas, and experienced weightlessness.They two came down in the Pacific and were picked up by an American warship.\n         What were the reasons for Jules Verne's extreme accuracy   in describing an event 100 years or more before it actually occurred? He based his writings on the laws of physics and astronomy.Nineteenth-century science and the vivid (clear) Verne's imagination gave people an unbelievably accurate (exact) prediction of one of the greatest events of the 20th century."

      "Televisions, stereos, telephones, and computers have changed the way we spend our time and what we know about the world. Some of the changes brought about by these material possessions have improved our way of life, but others have made it worse. Our young teenagers turn on the television, play the stereo, play games on the computer, talk on the telephone, and eat all the same time. This drives me right up the wall to instant insanity .\nHowever, teens of today place too great an importance on material property. They spend an average of several hours a day watching television, listening to stereos, playing on the computer, playing video games, and talking on the telephone. Families no longer watch television together and there is great lack of communication. Materialism is evident when an otherwise intelligent teenager drives their parents crazy, and into debt, when misusing communication equipment. Teens judge and admire other teens for what they own and have, rather than for what they are or what they can do. They no longer care about values, like honesty, integrity , freedom, talent, quality and other values and morals.\nHowever, good or bad, communication devices are here to stay. It is up to us, as parents, to stop our beloved teenagers from misusing and abusing our communication equipment and devices. We need to avoid the problems they present and to make the most of their opportunities they possess and hold for us all."

      "Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out."

      "Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse, and when he arrived in this hard world, it was very doubtful whether he would live beyond the first three minutes. He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing.\nOliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth. One was an old woman, who was nearly always drunk, and the other was a busy local doctor, who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival.  _ \nHowever, Oliver managed to draw his first breath, and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly. His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered, \"Let me see the child, and die.\"\nThe doctor turned away from the fire, where he had been warming his hands. \"You must not talk about dying yet,\" he said to her kindly. He gave her the child to hold. Lovingly, she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips, then stared wildly around the room, fell back--and died. \"Poor dear!\" said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.\nThe doctor began to put on his coat. \"The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties,\" he said. \"If so, give it a little milk to keep it quiet.\" Then he looked at the dead woman. \"The mother was a good-looking girl. Where did she come from?\"\n\"She was brought here last night,\" replied the old woman. \"She was found lying in the street. She'd walked some distance, judging by her shoes, which were worn to pieces. Where she came from, where she was going to, or what her name was, nobody knows.\"\nThe doctor lifted the girl's left hand. \"The old story,\" he said sadly, shaking his head. \"No wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night.\"\nAnd so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse. Without clothes, under his first blanket, he could have been the child of a king or a beggar. But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked."

      "This recently-released documentary had some fantastic footage  in it, and a very personal look at many of the astronauts who went to the moon. Overall, that is a very exclusive  club; only about a dozen men ever did it in the history of the world and just eight or nine ever stepped foot on it. Most of them are still alive and they discuss their adventures, insights and personal feelings here.\nOne gets the feeling that the rest of us will never know exactly how beautiful the moon is except to take the astronauts's words about it, because even the pictures on this DVD can't convey that.\nSince this documentary is about 100 minutes long, you get a lot of information. You also get reminded how close two of the three men who went up on that historic first walk on the moon almost didn't get home alive.\nAn absence in this documentary is the most famous astronaut of them all: Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon! Apparently, he did not want to be part of this film. One of the astronauts mentions something briefly about Armstrong being somewhat of a \"recluse \" now and it \"being understandable with what he's gone through\". From what I've read, a lot of people have tried to make money off him in shady ways and so now he's withdrawn  from the public spotlight.\nThis film, a legacy to the Apollo program and the brave men who ran it, should be in every schoolroom. It would make history more interesting to students."

      "I serve coffee at a diner in Texas. I often see a look of isolation   in my customers' eyes. They come in the front door, wander to the counter, pick up the menu, and look around the diner for something they can't short-order: a connection.\nIn an age of online chat, online shopping and even online school, it's no wonder people come into the diner starving for human connection. Most of my customers ask me about the happenings in my life when I serve up their eggs and meat.\nOne day, I walked back to the smoking section to pass around a fresh pot of coffee. There was a woman who had been sitting in a corner booth for at least three hours. She asked me, \"How much is just one breakfast taco  ?\" I told her I'd never served just one by itself. Going back to the kitchen I thought about her tired eyes. I offered her a free pancake breakfast. She asked to borrow the money for bus and promised to return and pay me back. I handed over tip money from my pocket. She smiled on her way out the front door.\nThree weeks later she returned my two dollars. She had gotten a job and a friend's bed to sleep on. She offered to buy me breakfast on my break!\nThis kind of thing gets me wondering if something as simple as a breakfast can bring about a small change in society, then why not take it even further and see if one act of friendliness can start to make peace? I believe it can. Peace begins with one person but spreads. When I connect with my neighbors, they return it in kind.\nSo I believe in friendliness and an open ear. For me, it starts with making eye contact when I pour coffee and ask my customers, \"How are you doing?\" and then listen to their answer. My job is to take care of customers, but I also believe we're to take care of each other."

      "Recently, a case of lifeboat ethics   occurred. On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine. \n It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  \nWe have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  \nA recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog?\n Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.  \n What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  \nWe prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings."

      "My father's family is not a musical family.They are a family of words.My brother has my father's dark hair,his love of a good argument.I take after my mother.From her I inherited a curious nature,a sense of adventure,bright red hair.I did not,contrary to her hopes,inherit a talent for the piano.That fact was established beyond doubt after unsuccessful attempts to draw music from me.\nThe piano lessons began when I was four.My mother was convinced that I would be a child Mozart.She found the ideal teacher-Madame Oblenka,a strict Russian woman,whose pursed lips were enough to frighten a wild horse into submission.Madame Oblenka,who expected a little Mozart,was not very delighted to find a little girl banging her fists  on the keys.\nI tried to please her.\"Feel the music,\"she urged.I\"felt\"it and winced  my ears-for what is more unpleasant than a series of wrong notes played continuously?She\"felt\"my music,too,which is why she always left with an angrier expression than when she came.\nOnce,when I was ten,I managed to record one of my own rehearsals .In order to escape my practice sessions,I would close myself behind the door of the piano room,put on the tape recording,and read until the tape had finished.That method worked for a week,until my mother began to wonder why I always missed the same B-sharp.She knocked on the door,and,receiving no answer,came in to check on me and found that I had fallen asleep while the tape of my performance played on and on.\nI was twelve when my parents finally acknowledged that my hidden talent was not about to emerge  any time soon.My mother,refusing to admit defeat,told me to pick another instrument.\"Choose anything you want,Honey,\"she said,assuming that freedom of choice would inspire devotion.I thought long and hard and chose the drums.My parents,sensitive to noise,would be less than overjoyed by a daily bombardment of playing.I imagined my father in his study,cotton wads in his ears.\nI worked my way through several other instruments before my mother hit on another idea.Maybe I wasn't meant to be an instrumentalist.Realizing that drama might be more suited to my talents,Mom took me to a drama teacher.However,he put me backstage,painting scenery.Once I recovered from my sense of injury,I realized the wisdom of his choice.I loved the active,practical backstage world,and I discovered that I had a knack for constructing and painting.I loved the challenge of taking our scanty supplies and using them to make something beautiful.Imagining a scene and then seeing it emerge before me-this,to me,was close to magic.\nI'm a sculptor now,and every day I experience afresh the joy of being fully absorbed in the act of artistic creation.It's a wonderful,blissful  feeling.I realize that my parents,in their misguided attempts to interest me in music,were trying to give me this feeling.And now I feel grateful.Perhaps they went about it in the wrong way,but their hearts were in the right place."

      "The majority of physicists once believed that the universe's expansion was slowing down. In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess."

      "Birds Can \"Read\" Human Gaze\nWe all know that people sometimes change their behavior when someone is looking their way. Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\""

      "Nowadays, more and more people prefer to travel by plane. They think air travel is far safer than driving a car on a busy motorway. But still there is a danger that grows every year. Airliners get larger and larger. Some airplanes can carry over 300 passengers. And the air itself becomes more and more crowded. If one large airliner struck into another in mid-air, 600 lives could be lost.\nFrom the moment an airliner takes off to the moment it lands, every movement is watched on radar screens. Air traffic controllers tell the pilot exactly when to turn, when to climb, and when to come down. The air traffic controllers around a busy airport like London-Heathrow may deal with 2,500 planes a day. Not all of them actually land at the airport.  Any plane that flies near the airport comes under the orders of the controllers there. Even a small mistake on their part could cause a terrible accident.\n    Recently such a disaster almost happened. Two large jets were flying towards the airport. One was carrying 69 passengers from Toronto, the other 176 passengers from Chicago. An air traffic controller noticed on his radar screen that the two planes were too close to each other. He ordered one to turn to the right and to climb. But he made a mistake. He ordered the wrong plane to do this. So, instead of turning away from the second plane, the first plane turned towards it. Fifteen seconds later it flew directly in front of the second plane. They avoided each other by the smallest part of a second. The distance between them was less than that of a large swimming pool. This is an example of the danger that grows every year."

      "How could we tell time if there were no watches or clocks anywhere in the world?\nThe sun was probably the world's first \"clock\", except in the far north, where the Eskimos  live. There it's dark most of the winter, and light most of the summer. But in most of the world, people have used the sun for a clock. Even today if you don't have a clock that shows time, you still know that when the sun shines, it's day; and when it's dark, it's night. The sun can not only tell you whether it's day or night but also it's morning, noon, or afternoon. When the sun is almost directly overhead, it's noon.\nPeople who live near the sea can tell time from the _ . In the daytime, for about six hours, the water rises higher and higher on the beach. And then it goes down and down for another six hours. The same thing happens again at night. There are two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours.\nSeamen on a ship learn how to tell time by looking at the moon and the stars .The whole sky is their clock.\nIn some places in the world the wind comes up at about the same time every day or changes direction or stops blowing. In these places, the wind can be the clock.\nA sand clock is an even better clock. If you had fine dry sand in a glass shaped like the one in the picture above, you would have what is called an hourglass. The sand in the hourglass goes from the top part to the bottom part in exactly one hour. When the hourglass it turned over, the sand will take another hour to go back again."

      "Putting in water fountains  at schools, and teaching children about the health benefits of water, could reduce their risk of getting extra pounds, reports a new study that is published in the latest issue of the journal pediatrics.\nThe findings are based on a survey in 32 elementary schools of two German cities, Dortmund and Essen. The researchers, led by Rebecca Muckelbauer, a nutrionist at the Research Institute of Child Nutrition Dortmund, weighed about 3,000 children, and asked them about their beverage  consumption.\nAt the beginning of the school year, the experts had water fountains added to 17 of the schools. The scientists also worked with teachers to carry out educational programs that promote the benefits of drinking water. In contrast to schools in the United States, there are very few schools in Germany that have water fountains.\nAt the beginning of the study, there were no big differences in the number of overweight children in different groups. But by the end of the school year, children in the schools with water fountains were 31 percent less likely to gain extra pounds, compared to kids who went to other schools, where water drinking was not encouraged.[:\nChildren in the schools with fountains, increased their water consumption from about 3 up to 4 glasses a day, while those in the other schools continued to drink an average of 3 glasses. Over the research, the number of overweight kids upped from 384 to 385 out of 1,641 at the schools with water fountains. In comparison, the number of overweight kids at the other schools increased from 339 to 364 out of 1,309, Dr. Muckelbauer said.\nThe experts cannot make any final conclusions and explain why the students who were encouraged to drink water were less likely to gain extra weight. Dr. Muckelbauer noted that according to a few other studies, drinking of water increases the rate at which calories are burned, while some other research suggested that water may temporarily decrease appetite."

      "The British Museum\nWhat's on\nAlthough many parts of Asia have long been connected through trade along Silk Road and shared religious systems, there are strong regional differences. In addition to various languages, Asia has developed its cultural networks, patterns of government, technology and styles of artistic representation.\nThe diverse cultural life of Africa has been expressed through everyday cooking objects and unique works of art since ancient times. The Museum's collection of over 200,000 African items includes archaeological and contemporary material from across the continent.\nThe Iron Age was a time of big change for the people of Britain and Europe.Iron replaced bronze as the material used to make tools and weapons, while religion, art, daily life, economics and politics changed greatly.\nAdmission and opening times\nThe Museum is free and open daily 10:00-17:30 except Friday, and is open until 20:30 on Fridays, except Good Friday.

      "In one way of thinking, failure is a part of life. In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \"spider story\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider spinning a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times without success. On the seventh time he _ and went on to spin his web. Bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone on to defeat the English... Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.\nSo what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top from yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time?\nSecond, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about his question, \"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway.\nThe third thing to bear in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \"live with yourself\" even though you may have failed. Remember, \"You can't win them all.\""

A guy deserts your friend.\nDon't say: \"I never liked that rat bastard   anyway!\" ( If the couple winds up reconciling  , you could end up losing your friend.) Do say: \"Breaking up is always hard to deal with, but I'm here for you, whatever you need.\"\n3. A friend has a death in the family.\nDon't say: \"It's God's will.\" or \"I know exactly how you feel.\" Do say: \"I'm sorry about your loss. What can I do to help?\"\n4. A friend loses a job suddenly.\nDon't say: \"Work is always boring. Those bosses didn't suit you!\" Do say: \"I'm sorry for that, but I know there's an even better job waiting for you there. Let's think about possibilities.\"\n5. Someone's pet dies.\nDon't say: \"Gee! It was only a cat!\" or \"My roommate doesn't like her dog and she is getting rid of her dog.

      "30thJune\nDear Aihua,\nHow are you? Sorry I haven't written for so long. I've been quite busy planning my holiday with may older brother, Coin. Do you still remember the trip I told you about? I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university. Well, now we're ready to go! We're going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things. We will go to Africa first. I can't wait! Have you been there?\nWe leave London on 15thJuly, and we'll be flying toprefix = st1 /Morocco, in Northern Africa. We're going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert. It's the biggest desert in the world-about the size of The US! I expect it will be very hot, dry and dusty _ . We'll be traveling by camel, with local guides, camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big, thick sleeping bags. I've heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights. I'll bring a torch with me so that I'll be able to see in the dark. The whole trip will take six days. That means I'll have to sit on a came for almost a week-how uncomfortable! I hope my camel likes me!\nAfter the trip by camel, we've going to travel down the River Nile. We'll start at Lake Victoria. A little way down the river from Victoria, the water actually gets quite rough. So, we'll go white-water rafting. It's quite dangerous, but very exciting! We have to wear special clothing, a helmet and a life jacket, just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white-water rafting, we're going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya. We'll live with the local people in their villages, and eat and drink like they do, including cow's blood! Do you think I should drink it?\nSince we'll be walking every day for almost two weeks, I'll need to buy a large, strong, light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water. During the day, we'll walk across the land, following the footprints of big animals such as elephants, lions and giraffes. We'll try to get as close as possible to the animals, even though they're dangerous, so that I can take some really good photos. But don't worry about me--our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close. I really want to see an elephant up close. Colin wants to see a giraffe.\nAfter that, we'll be moving on to Tanzania, where we're going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Mountain climbing can be very tiring, and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner, so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset. The African part of our trip will take about four weeks. Then we're going to the Himalayas. I'll send you postcards from all the different places we visit!\n                                                            Love\n                                                             Toby"

William H. Frey II, author of \"Crying: The Mystery of Tears,\" believes it may really be one of the body's clever self-repair mechanisms. Crying may be a way of getting rid of the by-products of stress, he says.\nHe has found that tears contain some chemicals which can cause stress. One of these is the hormone prolactin  , which is set free when one is feeling stressed. Since women have more of this than men, that might explain why they usually cry more, he suggests.\nUnsurprisingly, Dr Frey's study seemed to prove that most people feel better after a good cry. And sex has nothing to do with it --- the result was true for women and men. So, next time you feel like bursting into tears, go ahead. If Dr Frey is right, you'll be doing yourself a favour."

      "How Good Are US Drivers?\nThe CBS-TV\"National Drivers' Test\",showed that many US drivers have a lot to learn.Here's why.\nCBS picked 1799 sample drivers to take the test in TV studios in New York,Philadelphia,Chicago,and Los Angeles.More than two out of five of the drivers failed the test.And the average score was the lowest passing mark--51 points out of a possible 80.\nChicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points.Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points.New York and Philadelphia drivers got 50 points--a failing score.Drivers with 50 points or less were rated\"poorly informed\"by the judges.\nHere are some of the test results:\n1.Are men drivers better informed than women ones?\nYes.Men averaged 52 points.Women got an average of 49.\n2.Are older drivers better informed than younger drivers?\nNo.Drivers under 26 averaged 52 points.Drivers from 27 to 45 averaged 51.Drives over 45 failed with a 48-point average.\n3.Does education make a difference?\nYes.College graduates averaged 52 points.High school graduates averaged 50.Those without high school diplomas  got 48.And people who had taken driver education courses scored an average of 53 points--three more than those who hadn't.\n4.Does driving experience make a difference?\nYes.Drivers with three or more years of experience averaged 51 points.Drivers with less experience averaged 49.\nHere are some surprising facts brought out by the test:\n1.More than one out of three drivers did not know that a blinking red light means a full stop.\n2.Three out of ten drivers did not know that an octagonal(eight-sided)sign means stop.\n3.More than two out of three drivers did not know what to do when being\"tailgated \".\nThe answer:slow down,drive to the right,and let the driver behind pass.\nThe results of the test were turned over to the National Safety Council .They will help future safety planning."

Not at all.In fact.New York's drinking water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity.Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.\nHowever, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share, as bottlers and restaurateurs are longing for the profits from it.A restaurant's typical mark-up   on wine is 100 to 150 percent, while on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent.As a result, some restaurants are trying to sell more bottled water.Some of the more shameless tactics  include putting attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the diners whether they want it.\nRegardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear educated, and even a longing for lost purity."

      "Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the longest and most costly presidential campaign in American history. The election results were widely seen as a strong statement by voters on economy. A public opinion study reported by the Wall Street Journal found that about sixty percent of voters considered the economy as the top issue.\n   Mr. Obama faces the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of leading stocks has lost nearly thirty of its value. The government seized the nation's two largest home financing companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also took control of the huge insurance company, A. I. G.  The government is now a share holder in nine of the country's largest banks. That will expand to small banks , too. The amount spent on these rescue plans has been close to one trillion dollars. That amount could increase.\n    Another problem the new administration faces is the budget deficit . Some experts predict the deficit for next year's budget could be close to one trillion dollars. Some observers predict that the deficit will limit speeding in economic programs.\n   Barack Obama has promised a tax cut for middle income Americans. He is seeking fifty billion dollars in aid for states and job creation programs. Mr. Obama has put forward a health care reform plan that costs fifty to sixty-five billion dollars. Obama is also seeking to spend one hundred and fifty billion dollars on new energy technologies over the next ten years.\n   In addition, Mr. Obama has been discussing a program worth one hundred billion dollars.

      "Having a great collection of books at home doesn't really mean that you are a person who has a passion for literature and reading. It can be a family inheritance or it can be just to impress people around you by the fact that you are a person of culture. On the other hand, there are many persons who cannot afford to buy books, because some of them are quite expensive, but who usually go to libraries and spend hours reading something that interests them a lot, or just borrow books to home.\nFrom my point of view, literature is very important in our life. For example, reading is a means of gaining culture and enriching our knowledge in different areas. It can help us have a great imagination and it makes things easier when it comes to make compositions on different themes. It gives you the possibility to speak about science, even if you don't work in this domain, or you can express your opinion about a political aspect, just because you have read something connected to that.\nSecondly, literature offers us the possibility to enter the world of imagination, and to leave the real one for a couple of hours. We come to meet kings and queens many years ago, dream of being in the world of the rich or imagine how life will be in the future. Sometimes, we identify ourselves with the characters in the stories we read and they can give us some clues to solve our problems and how to react in certain circumstances.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that literature is the perfect means to enrich our culture, to express ourselves correctly, to have a rich vocabulary, to be able to interfere in conversations in different fields of interest and to really be considered an _ person."

      "A university is not just about careers and getting a well-paid job after graduation -- it's a place for learning about yourself and the world.\nSo how to select a suitable university is of great importance. How do you decide on a school when there are thousands of them to pick from? Start by asking yourself questions about your preferences:\nWhat are my strengths?\n1.Am I interested in liberal arts or science or business?\n2.What kind of learning environment is best for me?\n3.Would I be more comfortable in a small school or a large one?\n4.Do I want to stay close to home or live far away?\n5.Would I prefer to be in a city environment or a small college town?\n6.Do I like being with people who are mostly like me or do I want to meet a different group?\nAsk friends and older people who are in college about their schools and about other schools they're familiar with. Talk to one of your teachers and go to college fairs when they visit your town.\nOnce you've narrowed down your choices, ask the schools to send you related materials and visit their websites. When you've cut your list down to a manageable number, make arrangements to visit. Try to do this when the schools are having regular classes, so you can get a good idea of what life is really like on campus.\nAnd remember: you're not the only one making a decision. Schools are picking from a large pool of students. They want to know how excellent you are and what makes you stand out from everyone else. They will look at your school performance, test scores, and so on, so it's important to devote time and effort to all these things."

      "In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand with a small notepad and a hole for a pencil.\n    I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother.Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, now the paper and pencil look the same as they always did.Surely it can't be the same pencil. The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is surely the original one.\n    \"I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years.\" I say to her, \"Can't you afford a new one?\"\n    My mother replies ,\"It works perfectly well.I've always kept the stand in the kitchen.I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days.\"\nShe smiles and says, \"One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a great thought, but the stand was empty.One of the children must have taken the paper.So I just picked up the breadboard  and wrote it all down on the back.The idea turned out to be really helpful in solving the mathematical problem I was working on.\"\nThis story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how special my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician.I feel ashamed that I complain  about not having enough child-free time to work.Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards.Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics.Those marks have travelled through fifty years, rooted in a cheap wooden breadboard, exhibits at every meal."

      "Do you want to be productive at work or at home? Here's what you should do.\n1. Cut off television\nI used to tell myself that I needed a break. So, when the kids slept I turned on the cable and watched whatever program that caught my fancy. Often, I found myself not watching, just channel-surfing. And I didn't end up watching a full program. I decided one day to just give up on TV as it made me sleep late and woke up tired.\nIf you want to be productive, cut off TV. You are better off reading a book. Without TV, I have managed to finish many books which I have bought but never read.\n2. Limit Internet use\nThe other big distraction that can make you sleep late is the Internet. Probably because you will be checking your emails, updating your blog, watching YouTube, etc. Try limiting the use of it at home, or switch it to the morning session.\nNowadays, I check all my personal emails early in the morning. When I get into work, I find myself less tempted to check personal emails.\n3. Know your priorities \nReally, it is all about the choices you make and the priorities you have. If you know it is competitive out there in the world, how can you be a better worker than the person who is also aiming for the position above you?\n4. Rest early, rise early\nDo you want to be productive? Rise early, read more books, have more energy, be more focused and set standards for others to catch up. It's as simple as that."

      "In countries around the world, food has been used to celebrate at our holidays, our rituals and our family gatherings. The food eaten at holiday time has made the deepest impact on our culture and memories. Different holidays bring different types of food. Much of the food we eat during the holidays comes from old traditions handed down for hundreds of years.\nNew Year's Eve always brings parties and get-togethers, but where you live in the world may determine what food graces your table. In the southern US, partiers eat black eyed peas, which are thought to bring good luck and prosperity . The Japanese also eat food for good luck on New Year's, but their choice is red snapper, the color red being considered good luck in Japan. The Jewish celebrate New Year by eating apples dipped in honey and in Madrid, Spain the last minutes of the New Year are counted down with the popping of grapes into the mouth. A pet is a cake prepared by the Greek with a coin baked into it. The person who gets the slice of cake with the coin in it should have good luck in the upcoming year.\nIn the United States, a typical Christmas feast can contain a variety of foods ranging from turkey to chicken, from ham to goose, but other countries celebrate this holiday differently. Perhaps these choices have been taken from the traditions of our heritage . In Denmark, a traditional Christmas meal is roast goose, Greece, leg of lamb. Traditionally, Italians keep their Christmas Eve meal meatless. The traditional Christmas dinner in New Zealand is a picnic eaten on the beach.\nThough holidays around the world are celebrated in different ways, it is food, feast and family that bring us together."

      "Everyone has some opinion about history, no matter how ill-informed. Walking through a parking lot in a university in Miami, I noticed a bumper sticker   that said, \"Ruin a Liberal's   Day--Recite Historical Fact!\" But Marwick thinks this sort of opinion is just fine; it is unavoidable that we all feel a sense of ownership of history.\nHistory never stands still, as Marwick says at the beginning of The Nature of History, \"The shape and content of history, too, vary according to the methods and materials available to different generations.\" Marwick's goal is to explain, in plain language, the changes in the way history is done up to the present; one method is to connect history with advances in the physical sciences. Marwick examines a number of case studies toward the end of the book. He ends the book with a refreshing collection of aphorisms   about history. History truly belongs to each and every man and we all belong to history; with the proper education, history can be made more accessible to everyone.\nMarwick relates how inventions and the physical sciences have driven historical changes. Dropping a ball in a vacuum will reveal the same properties   each time the experiment is conducted, providing the conditions are the same. But historians obviously do not have the luxury of reproducing such conditions; historians view the past through the present which depends on invention and science.\nBy looking at the changing nature of history, Marwick feels the study progressing. Although Marwick suspects some people would accuse a historian of creating job security with the endless views of the past, he insists it is imperative based on the philosophy, science, and new materials of the age. History, according to Marwick, must be for everyone and not remain locked behind the walls of academia."

      "CHICAGO ---- For working parents and heavily scheduled school kids, family mealtime is out of fashion. But supermarkets are trying to attract families back to the dinner table.\nThere is a _ if family members have meals apart: research shows that teenagers who don't eat with their parents face a greater risk of drug and alcohol problems.\n\"The more often kids have dinner with their parents, the less likely they are to smoke, drink or use drugs,\" said Joseph Califano Jr., head of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, which did the research.\nStores are familiar with the idea and will start telling shoppers about the findings and encouraging them to share meals together at home, instead of separately or at restaurants.\nThe food marketing Institute will give $25,000 to the center and help stores promote the center's Family Day in September.\nMany stores have grab-and-go dinners and recipe cards. Some have kiosks where people can taste a main dish, then pick out side dishes.\n\"Our members have worked hard to try to have easily prepared food either ready to eat or ready to take home,\" said Tim Hammonds, the institute's president and chief executive.\nLos Angeles-based Contessa Premium Foods makes frozen delicious meals, which a family can heat in 10 minutes to 12 minutes. \"That's nearly as fast as a TV dinner,\" said president and chief executive John Z. Blazevich, \"but is healthier and makes people feel like they actually cooked.\"\n\"The preparation is the hardest part, so we try to combine a variety of tastes and flavours from around the world and make it fast and easy,\" he said.\n\"Eating at home helps keep meals healthy and teaches kids how to eat right. If we can get people back to having family dinners, parents back to being engaged with their kids, it will have a surprising impact,\" he said."

It usually appears during the summer and autumn months. HFMD isn't Bird Flu, SARS or Mad Cow Disease, but it's not a new one, either. It first appeared in New Zealand in 1957. About forty years later, it appears in Asia. It's reported that it breaks out every 2 or 3 years.\nHFMD is very terrible and there is no vaccine   now, but we can do something helpful to prevent it. 'Children with HFMD should seek medical treatment as early as possible', experts say. They also suggest that parents keep the air fresh in a child's room, which should be kept clean, tidy and dry.

He also invented the motion picture camera and 1200 other things. About every two weeks he created something new.\nThomas Edison was born in 1847. He attended school for only three months. His mother taught him at home, but Thomas was mostly self-educated. He started experimenting at a young age.\nWhen he was 12 years old, he got his first job. He became a newsboy on a train. He did experiments on the train in his spare time. Unluckily, his first work experience did not end well. They _ him when he accidentally set fire to the floor of the train. Then Edison worked for five years as a telegraph operator, but he continued to spend much of his time in experimenting his first patent  in 1868 for a vote recorder run by electricity.\nThomas Edison was totally deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other, but he thought of his deafness as a blessing in many ways. It kept conversations short, so that he could have more time for work. He always worked 16 out of every 24hours.

      "What's the coolest kind of transportation  for middle school students back from winter holidays? A racing bike? A car? No, it's a special kind of shoes called Heelys . Heelys look just like common sports shoes, but they have a wheel  hidden  in the heel . So instead of walking, kids can \"fly\" around in them.\n\"Wearing Heelys is fun and cool!\" said Wu Peng, a boy who wore them on his first day back at No. 6 Middle School in Beijing. Wu Peng said he loves the shoes so much that he wears them to go here and there. Sometimes he even follows his parents' car to the supermarket in his Heelys!\nOther students also think they are very cool, but some aren't so lucky with their Heelys. It's said that some children fell down and got hurt while wearing these shoes.\n\"Heelys wheels are in the heels of the shoes, so it's easy to fall,\" said Liu Rui, a doctor at the Hong Kong International Medical Clinic, Beijing. Even worse, Liu said, \"Wearing Heelys for a long time could stop young people from developing their legs. \""

      "APRIL 5 marks the 100thanniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. In 1997, the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world. Now, the 3-D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10.\nAs anyone who has seen the movie knows, the Titanic struck an iceberg  and sank on its first _ in 1912, killing 1,517 people. A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,."

He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks.\nIt was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump  into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23.\nAt first, Hawking became very sad, after a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later wrote, \"Before my illness was diagnosed , I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do.\" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research.\nToday, Hawking still works at Cambridge University as a professor. He strongly believes that his story shows that nobody, however bad their situation is, should lose hope. \"Life is not fair,\" he once said. \"You just have to do the best you can in your own situation.\""

      "All over the world the need for more laptops and computers increases each year. Networks have been part of our life. Probably everyone with a portable device (} has once logged on to a public WiFi network without paying for it, while they are having a coffee, on a train, in a shopping mall or at a hotel. However, is this kind of public WiFi network safe?\nSome networks are better protected than others because encryption  methods are used. Therefore, they are safer than others. But a survey in 2015 showed that more than 950 million records were not protected, including addresses, emails, birth dales, phone numbers, passwords and so on. These open WiFi networks are really not safe, because it is very easy for hackers   to break into the operating system and get people's private information.\nMost smartphones and laptops, by themselves, search and connect to WiFi networks. They usually prefer a network with a connection that has been used before. Hackers' devices are able to record these searches and look like the trusted WiFi networks. When these smartphones and laptops log on to the networks which are not real, hackers can easily steal their private information.\nSo next time, when we want to use our laptops or our smartphones in public places which offer free WiFi networks,please think it twice or take safe measures before using them."

I'm not a shy person, and I was very comfortable speaking to everyone. So I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned lots of interesting things about American culture. When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future.\nCarla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro\nI spent last year studying English in London. I'm from a small town, and London is a very big city. Sometimes I felt it was too big. There were so many people to talk to, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family, and I really missed my two cats. My roommate was always using our telephone, so I hardly had the chance for a nice long talk with my parents. I think it was a good experience for me, but I'm glad to be home!\nAlvin Chen - Hong Kong\nStudying in New Zealand was a fun experience for me, but it was also lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week----with lots of homework. I also kept a diary of my experience. I like to write, and I wrote two or three pages in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things about the culture. I'm really glad I went!"

      "Moms take care of their children and dads bring home food and make the family rules. These are the roles moms and dads fall into when they become parents and it's common among all cultures. But times change and parents' roles seem to be changing,too. More women are bringing home food by having fulltime jobs and men are taking care of their children at home.\nChinese TV show Where Are We Going,Dad?provides a closer look at the changing roles of dads in modern family life. The show follows the adventures   of five celebrity   dads who take trips with their young children (aged 4 to 6) and try to complete a set of tasks. It shows how young dads are trying hard to find the best way to raise their children and keep a closer relationship with them. Young dads no longer want to be cold.\nPsychologists   say that a strong fatherly influence is important in a child's development. Fathers teach their children skills and encourage them to try new things. They also give them a sense of safety. A child learns that if something goes wrong,he or she can depend on dad to help fix it. The psychologists also say that without a dad,a child is more possible to drop out of school and get into trouble.\nA mother's love is important,and so is a father's love. Chen Mo,a psychology professor says,\"It takes both parents to raise a child. Children have different needs at different ages and this needs to be considered  by both parents.\""

      "What colour is your name? What colour is Wednesday? These questions might sound strange to most people, but some can answer right away. One person says her name is the colour red. For another person, Wednesday is blue. These people have a condition called synesthesia. This means they experience two senses at the same time. For these people, the senses of smell, sound, sight, touch, and taste are not separate  .They might see and also hear colours, for example, or hear as well as feel sounds.\nThe most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours, A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red. Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April. Another person might see different colours while listening to music. Some people also taste colours. To one person, beef might taste blue and to another, yellow. Some people experience feelings in colour. For example, one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange.\nAnother form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes. Some people see music as squares and circles. Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball. There are other forms of synesthesia, as well. For one man, different words have different tastes. Some words taste like pork;others taste like potatoes or eggs.\nSynesthesia is not a common condition. Perhaps only one person in every 5,000 has it. For these people, the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place."

The character can go straight, sit down, turn left, turn right or pick up things in the game.\nSome 3D games have many levels . The character needs to finish different goals  for each level. Game players can against their computers, and sometimes they can play with other players online . It's great fun to play 3D games. But playing 3D games for long is not good for our study."

      "Many people go to school for an education. They learn languages, history, geography, physics, chemistry and mathematics. Others go to school to learn a skill so that they can make a living. School education is very important and useful. Yet no one can learn everything from school; no matter how much the teacher knows, he cannot teach his students everything they want to know. The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn. He teaches them how to read and how to think. So much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves.\nIt is always more important to study by oneself than to memorize some facts or a formula .\nIt is actually quite easy to learn a certain fact in history or a formula in mathematics. But it is very difficult to use a formula in working out a maths problem. Great scientists, such as Einstein, Newton and Galileo didn't get everything from school. But they were all so successful. They invented so many things for mankind. The reason for their success is that they knew how to study. They read books that were not taught at school.

      "Since January 2013, many cities in China have seen a lot of foggy days. In Beijing, only five days in January _ smog  . What's the difference between fog and smog?\nAccording to scientists, fog is made up of tiny   drops of water and also ice particles   during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.\nAn official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\nPoor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.\nTo respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action.\nBeijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched.\nThree students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment. With all our efforts, the blue skies will certainly return soon,\" said Shi Yucong, 15, one of the three students."

      "I was not having a happy holiday. My family had decided to go back to the countryside in New Hampshire, US, again. But I found it boring. What made the holiday even worse was that I had to sleep in the same bed as my brother. But I was wrong. This trip was the best holiday I have ever had. During the holiday, I met a very special friend.\nWhile I was walking in the countryside, I saw a man carrying a small brown bag. Wearing white clothes, the man looked like a ghost. As he looked at me, I felt frightened. I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me. \"Hello. Beautiful day, isn't it?\" he said. The man talked a lot. I wasn't listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag. I wanted to see what was inside it!\nHe saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see. Out came a lively, beautiful puppy. The brown puppy was small and only about two months old. The man then asked me, \"Would you like to keep this puppy?\" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance. I thanked him, took the puppy and ran home. For the rest of that summer, I played with him all the time. And after the trip, I took him home. The puppy is now loved by all my family. He is a friend to both my brother and me, a warm little ball of happiness in our lives.\nI've always wanted to thank the man because he changed my life. His gift has given me years of pleasure. And I never have boring family holidays anymore."

Write down new ideas after you read.\nl Share. Einstein used to talk to his friends and explain his ideas. Sometimes, a friend can help you find the answer to a problem.\nl Be brave.

She was not sure what gave her the idea, but she wanted to look like a movie star. \"I have a lot of pictures from my childhood of me wearing sunglasses,\" she says. \"I used to wear them to watch TV.\"\nEarly movie actors started wearing sunglasses, not because they looked good, but because their eyes hurt. The lights used on movie sets were really bright and could cause a painful problem known as \"Klieg eyes\". It was named after the Klieg brothers who invented the lights. Actors wore sunglasses to give their eyes a rest. But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must.\nFrom then on, actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hepburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's. As a result, Ray-Ban sunglasses started to appear more and more in the movies. In 1979, Ray-Ban \"Wayfarers\" were worn by Jake and Elwood in The Blue Brothers. Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban \"Aviator\" sunglasses in the 1986 hit, Top Gun. Then in 1997, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made Ray-Ban \"Predator\" sunglasses famous in Men in Black."

      "Fred Astaire was born in Nebraska in 1899. Fred and his sister, Adele, learned to dance when they were very young. Their mother took them to New York to study dance. They performed in their first professional show when Fred was ten years old and Adele was twelve. Later, as teenagers, the two danced in many shows throughout the United States. Their first big success was on Broadway in 1917.\nThe Astaires -- as they were known --- became Broadway stars. However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing. But Fred did not give up his dream. He would go on alone, in the movies.\nFred said, \"Dancing is a sweaty job. You cannot just sit down and do it. You have to get up on your feet. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.\"\nIn 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK]\nFred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time. He said a dancer could not continue dancing forever. He said he did not want to disappoint  anyone, even himself. He danced again in public only once after that. It was with another great male dancer, Gene Kelly, in the movie \"That's Entertainment, Part Two\".\nFred Astaire and his first wife, Phyllis, had three children. Phyllis died in 1954. Twenty-five years later, Fred married race horse rider Robyn Smith. Fred Astaire died on June 22, 1987. He was eighty-eight years old. He was called the greatest dancer in the world. His dancing was called perfect. And moviegoers everywhere will remember him as a great performer whose work will live forever in his films."

      "Can you swim? Do you like swimming? Yes? Well, how can you learn to swim? I think the best way is to go into the water and learn. I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice.\nListening and speaking are very important for beginners. The children in English-speaking countries first listen to others. Then they try to imitate  and speak. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word.\nSomebody may be a good listener. But he is terrified to speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important. When there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense . This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success.\nEasier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English better in this way."

      "Getting electricity has always been a problem for the 173 people living in Nuevo Saposoa, a small village in Peru, South America. However, things went from bad to worse in March 2015 after heavy rains damaged the only power cables in the area. The villagers were forced to use oil lamps, which are not only expensive but also dangerous because of the harmful gases they produce.\nLuckily, researchers at the University of Technology (UT) in Lima, Peru heard about their problem and found a wonderful solution. They made a lamp that can be powered by plants and soil, both of which can be easily found in the Amazonian rainforest where the village lies. The lamp takes energy from a plant growing in a wooden box and uses it to light up an LED light bulb.\nWhile that may sound amazing and even impossible, the science behind the ides is quite simple. As plants create their food (using the sun's energy, water and chemicals from the soil), they also produce waste which they return to the soil. Tiny animals in the soil eat this waste and they produce electrons - the building blocks of electrical energy. The UT team put special sticks inside the soil to capture the energy and keep it in the lamp's batteries for later use. The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done.\nThe university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015. So far, they have been a huge success! Elmer Ramirez, the UT professor who invented the lamp, believes the Plant Lamp could help improve the lives of many people, especially small rainforest communities, 42% of whom have no electricity."

      "As young students, you have many dreams. These dreams can be very big, such as winning the Nobel Prize; they can also be small, such as becoming one of the best students in your class.\nOnce you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream real? Follow Your Heart by Andrew Matthews, an Australian writer, tells us that making our dreams real is life's biggest challenge. You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a writer. Those kinds of ideas stop you from realizing your dream, the books says.\nIn fact, everyone can realize his dream. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want every day and then your dream will come true faster. You should know that a big dream is, in fact, made up of many small dreams.\nYou must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will help you to get better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book.\nAs you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. This is good as you have the chance to learn something more useful and find new hobbies."

      "Geoffrey Payne talks for the first time about the night his wife was killed. The judge thought it was he who killed his wife. Now he wrote to a magazine from the prison   about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999.\nI had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11 p. m. I drove home slowly because the weather was terrible--the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily,  I was turning into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was frightened and the man looked frightened too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange.\nWhen I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.\nI was still very upset about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead. I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything.\nThe next thing I knew, the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived about half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighbourhood? Why did he look so frightened\"! Why did he run away?"

      "Nelson Mandela was regarded as one of the greatest leaders in the world. He died at the age of 95. He became his country's first black president after 27 years in prison. Do you want to know why he spent so many years in prison? Read more and find more facts.\nWhen Nelson Mandela was a young man, white and black people in South Africa lived separate lives. White people, who were a small part of the population, were in charge of the country. At that time, it was illegal for black people to use the same schools, hospitals, and even beaches as white people. Mandela was lucky. He was one of the few black people in the 1950s of South Africa to receive education and become a successful lawyer.\nNelson Mandela believed that everybody should be treated equally. He joined some different demonstrations to fight against a system called apartheid.\nSometimes the demonstrations turned violent and in 1962 Mandela was sent to a prison which was on Robben Island. But many people around the world campaigned for his release. Songs were written and big concerts were held in protest. Finally in 1990 the South African President FW de Klerk--a white man--allowed him to go free. Mandela had spent 27 years in prison and was greeted as a hero on his release."

      "The population of the world is increasing rapidly. By 2020, there could be 7.5 billion people on the earth. Will there be enough food for all these people? Some scientists think fish farming might solve this problem. However, other scientists worry that fish farming could bring serious environmental problems.\nFish farming is not a new thing. There were fish farms in China 3,000 years ago. Today, about one third of the fish we eat comes from fish farms.\nMost fish farms raise plant-eating fish. Popular kinds of plant-eating fish are carp, tilapia, and catfish. However, many fish farms are starting to raise meat-eating fish. A popular type of meat-eating fish is salmon. However, it takes up to 5 tons of wild fish to produce just 1 ton of farm-raised salmon. So if this continued, many types of wild fish could become _ .\nCritics   of fish farming also say that farm-raised fish is unhealthy. They say there are dangerous chemicals   in the fish. They also say fish farming pollutes the water. Some people say that the ways of farming being used now won't produce enough fish anyway. Instead of building fish farms in lakes or near the coast, they say that the fish farms could be moved far out into the ocean. In the future, fish farms might be large cages that move to the ocean."

      "Life is full of surprises and you never know how things will turn out .Sir John Gurdon is a good example of this. As a boy, he was told he was hopeless at science and finished bottom of his class. Now, aged 79, the very same Gurdon shared the 2012 Nobe Prize in Medicine with Japanese stem cell  researcher Shinya Yamanaka.\nLike so many scientists, Gurdon shows us where the power of curiosity and perseverance  can lead.\nAt the age of 15 in 1948, Gurdon ranked last out of the 250 boys at his high school in biology and every other science subject. Gurdon's high school science teacher even said that his dream of becoming a scientist was\"quite ridiculous\".\nIn spite of his teacher s criticisms,Gurdon followed his curiosity and kept working hard. He went to the lab early and left later than anyone else. He experienced thousands of failures.\n\"My own belief is that we will, in the end, understand everything about how cells actually work,\" Gurdon said.\nIn 1962, Gurdon took a cell from an adult frog and moved its genetic information into an egg cell. The egg cell then grew into a clone  of the adult frog. This technique later helped to create Dolly the sheep in 1996, the first cloned mammal in the world.\nIn 2006,Gurdon's work was developed by Yamanaka to show that a sample of a person's skin can be used to create stem cells. Using this technique, doctors can repair a patient's heart after a heart attack.\nLuck favors the prepared mind Gurdon told the Nobel Prize Organization. \"Ninety percent of the time things don't work,but when they do,you have to seize the chance.\""

      "Saying no starts small\n'All right then-just one more piece...' Words every girl has said when they are faced with the delicious cheesecake. Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.\nIt isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.\nScientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'. Don't try to do too many things at the same time, or when you don't have enough energy, for example when you are ill.  If you already feel tired, you can try to recharge  your willpower with a good night's sleep and by eating well."

      "The long trunk of an elephant is a wonderful example of skill. The neck of four-footed animals is usually long, to have them reach their food without difficulty, but the elephant has a short neck, to make him more easily support the weight of his huge head and heavy teeth. His long trunk lets him get his food easily.\nThe trunk of an elephant is to him what the neck is to other animals. It is also a nose to him, for at the end of it there is a empty place like a cup, and in the bottom of the cup are two holes, and the animal smells and breathes through them. It is an arm and a hand too, so that it has been said that the elephant carries his nose in his hand, and it might also have been said that he breathes by hi s hand.\nAt the end of the trunk, there is a strange part, about five inches long, which forms a finger. With this finger the animal can pick up the smallest piece of money from the ground, and he has been taught to make marks like letters with a pen.\nThe trunk of a full-grown elephant is about eight feet long.

      "Many earthquakes happen without warning, so it is important to know what to do when it happens. Here are some tips on how to stay safe in earthquakes.\n*Keep a cool head. Worry won't help you. Think about what you should do. The first several seconds are important.\n*If you are indoors, stay inside and _ and cover. Hide under a desk or table, or stand in a corner. Cover your head and neck with your arms. Stay away from windows and anything that could fall on you.\n*If you are in a crowded  hall or shop, don't rush for the door. You will find too many people trying to get out at the same time. Instead, lower  yourself close to the ground and cover your head and neck with your hands and arms.\n*If you are outdoors, try to get into an open area away from buildings, trees or street lights.\n*If you are trapped in a place, you may make noises by knocking at the rocks. But don't shout all the time. You could be without help for up to 72 hours. Try to find some water and food.\n*Stay in your seat if in a cinema or a theatre. Get below the level  of the back of the seat. Cover your head and neck with your arms.\n*Stay in a safe area until you are sure it's OK to leave. Some aftershocks  may follow. They are as dangerous as the earthquake."

      "There are many different kinds of disasters around the world. As an adult you know what to do during a disaster, but what about the children? Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster:\nEducate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.\nPrepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.\nPlan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with \"listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119\".\nPractice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months. Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes.\nDisasters can't be avoided but they can be lessened once you are prepared and ready for one."

According to the law , all children between five and sixteen must go to school on weekdays, and their parents must make sure of _ .\nThe number of children missing school is increasing. The government is worried, because, according to a research, children who often don't go to school are more likely to smoke, drink under age or do some other bad things. Also, it' s difficult for them to do well in exams. What's more, it's harder for them to get a job after they leave school. Since 2002,the police have kept checking town centers where truants often go. These happen twice a year. During each check, a student will be stopped and asked why they are not in school. This will happen even though they are with an adult. The police will stop and question children who they think do not have a reason for being out of school. The police are not allowed to catch truants, but they can take them back to school. The police said there were nearly twice more boys playing truant than girls.\n,. (5,2,10)"

It is said that e-schoolbags are going to be brought into use in Chinese middle schools soon.\nHeavy schoolbags have been a serious problem for a long time. But the e-schoolbag will work it out. An e-schoolbag is much lighter than a usual schoolbag. Perhaps, the e-schoolbag should be called an e-textbook.

      "Take a look at the label  on almost any bottle of milk and you may see the word PASTEURIZED. What does that mean? Let's find out by meeting Louis Pasteur.\nLouis Pasteur was born in 1822 in a little town in France. As he grew up, he loved to paint. He loved to look at the world around him. When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them \"microbes\" or \"germs\"-- that crowded in a drop of water.\nOne day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. \"Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,\" he said to Pasteur. \"Can you help me find out why?\"\nPasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too. When farmers heated milk, it didn't turn bad so quickly. When breweries heated beer, it tasted better. People called it \"pasteurization\" ---heating a liquid to kill bad germs. Aren't you glad that the milk you drink has been pasteurized?"

Then place a long stemmed white carnation  in the coloured glass of water. Each day. Watch as the white carnation changes into the same colour as the food colouring. Children can see that plants drink water and where the water goes, and this is a favourite Earth Day activity for kids.\nLeaf collection\nThis Earth Day project is fun and easy to do. First, take a walk in the field and children can collect lots of leaves. When collection is complete, kids can place the leaves in between two pages of white paper and then put them together to make a leaf book.\nFeed the birds\nHere you will find an exciting Earth Day activity that helps animals, especially birds. Find or purchase a large pinecone . Cover the pinecone with butter and bread. Hang the homemade bird feeder on a tree near a window and watch the birds come to have their dinner.\nClean the park\nThere are many organized events in towns and cities for clean-up activities on Earth Day. But if one is not offered in your town or city, you can do some clean-up just by yourself in the local park. A huge clean-up is not necessary; a little help goes a long way and the idea is to show kids that keeping public areas clean is everyone's business."

      "Just how popular was Mini? Very. Every year her classmates voted  her the favorite student. The friends she had were much more than those of anyone else.\nOne day Mini was caught yakkety-yakking  and ordered to stay back as punishment . Staying back meant doing something \"useful\", like helping in the library after school.\nNow Mini's school had a rule. Once a month, if you had something else to do the day you were punished, you could ask a friend to stand in for you.\nUnluckily, her aunt was visiting Mini that day. That afternoon was the only chance Mini had of seeing her for another five years.\nMini needed someone to stand in for her. She asked Betty, her \"best\" friend. \"Oh, no, Mini, I can't,\" Betty said. \"I must help my brother do his homework.\"\n\"Tony, will you stay back for me?\" Mini asked another friend. \"I wish you'd told me earlier. I have to go to a relative's house with my father,\" he said.\nNow, Mini was beginning to doubt  if even one of her friends would agree to stay. But she tried again. She asked three more friends and each one refused.\nSo, after school Mini stayed to help the librarian. And, when she found Mini crying after everyone had left, it was she who surprised Mini by allowing her to leave to meet her aunt. \"I may have many friends,\" Mini said to herself, \"but in reality I have none.\""

      "Have you ever stayed in a hotel? Most Chinese hotels often provide guests with things like disposable  toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and slippers. Many guests like the idea because they don't have to bring their own. But ,if you travel to Beijing , remember to bring your own things. Starting from June, some hotels in Beijing will no longer provide guests with these disposable things. They want to ask people to use less disposable things.\nMany disposable things are made of plastic. People throw them away after only using them once. It is a waste of natural resources  and is very bad for the environment. Do you know, one Chinese makes as much as 400kg of waste a year! Most of that waste comes from disposable things. In Beijing, people throw away about 19,000 tons of plastic bags and1,320 tons of plastic lunch bowls every year! Plastic can take between 100 and 400 years to break down. So the less plastic we throw out, the better. So, wherever you travel, bring your own things and use them again and again.\nBack at home and at school, you can also do something, you can also do something to make our world a better place. Try to do these things in your daily life: Use cloth shopping bags, not plastic ones. After using a plastic bag, wash it out and let it dry. Then you can use it over and over again. Do not use paper cups. At your school canteen , use your own bowl and chopsticks instead of disposable ones.\nTo protect our environment and our home, it is very necessary and important for us to save natural resources ."

      "Peter was getting ready to graduate from the college. He loved a beautiful sports car for many months, and knew his father could well afford it for him. He told his father all that he wanted.\nAs the graduation day was coming near, Peter had got nothing from his father. On the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his study. He told his son how proud he was to have such a good son, and told how much he loved him. Then he gave his son a beautiful gift box. He opened the box, finding a lovely book, a Bible , with the young man's name in it. Angrily he raised his voice to his father and said, \"With all your money you give me a Bible?\" He then ran out of the house, leaving the Bible.\nMany years later, Peter was very successful in business. He had a beautiful house and a wonderful family. Realizing his father was old, he thought he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Unfortunately, he was told that his father had died.\nWhen he reached his father's house, he began to take care of his father's papers. And then he found the Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened it and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, from the back of the Bible dropped a car key. That was the key to the sports car he wanted so much.

      "Weekday mornings are very busy for us middle school students.People are running into each other, shouting across the house,knocking on the bathroom door and always,always running late.When you're late for the carpool,though,you also make everyone else late.\nWhen your school doesn't have a bus,and you live too far away to walk,you need a carpoo1.A carpool is a group of people sharing the responsibility of driving to school in the morning.There are usually four or five kids in a carpool and their parents take turns driving the kids in their cars.\nSomeone's car smells like wet dogs,some kids get to eat desserts for breakfast and  some parents shout so much that all you try to do is stay quiet and go unnoticed.When your mom or dad drives the carpool,your classmates get a close-up look at how strange your parents can be.It might be your first sociological study and your first experience with real teamwork.\nTeamwork is really important in the carpool because nobody wants to make everyone else late.It's a great lesson in responsibility .Imagine sitting in the car outside of a classmate's house,watching the clock and tapping your toes.Then you start to understand how your carpool friends might feel when you are still inside the house at 7:48.You really begin to learn all your real life lessons just moments before the start of school in the carpoo1."

      "The marathon  in my town usually takes place in hot weather. My job was to follow the runners to help those who needed medical help. \"We should stay behind the last runner, so take it slowly,\" I said to the driver, Doug.\nAs it began, the front runners started to disappear . Then I noticed a woman in blue running shorts and a white T-shirt. \" Doug, look!\" We knew we were watching our \"last runner\". Her feet turned in , yet her left knee turned out. Her legs were so crippled  that it seemed impossible for her to be able to walk. How could she run a marathon?\nWe watched in silence as she slowly moved forward. We would move forward a little bit, then stop and wait for her. Then we would slowly move forward a little bit more. As I watched her try to put one foot in front of the other, I found myself breathing for her. I wanted her to stop, and at the same time, I hoped that she wouldn't. Finally, she was the only runner left in sight. When the finishing line came into sight, we found the cheering people had all gone home. She slowly crossed through the line and lifted her hands, full of happiness.\nI do not know the woman's name, but since that day she has become a part of my life. For her, it was about finishing what she had set out to do, no matter what. When I think things are too difficult and want to say \"I just can't do it\", I think of the last runner. Then I realize how easy the task before me really is."

It will tell you a lot about the word: the pronunciation, the Chinese meaning and how to use the word. But how can you know where the word is thousands of English words? How to find it in the dictionary both quickly and correctly?\nFirst, all the English words are arranged  in the letter order. In the dictionary you can first see the words beginning with letter A, then B, C, D.... That means, if there are two words \"desert\" and \"pull\", \"desert\" will be certainly before \"pull\". Then if there are two words both beginning with the same letter, you may look at the second letter. Then the third, the fourth... For example, \"pardon\" is before \"plough\", \"judge\" before \"just\", etc.\nDo you understand how to look up in the dictionary?\nThe dictionary will be your good friend.

I decided to throw something away. I was walking towards a dustbin  when I noticed a poor man walking out of the restaurant in front of us. He walked to the nearby dustbin and started looking through it.\nI suddenly felt very sorry because I was going to throw away a new drink just because it was too heavy. I walked up to him and gave the drink and some bread to him, which surprised him. The man looked at me in surprise and took what I gave him. A big smile appeared on his face. I felt I couldn`t be happier with myself. But then he said.\"Wow, this is my son's lucky day!\"\nWith that, he thanked me happily and started off on his bike. I even heard him singing as he rode away. I got a warm feeling inside. I now understand what it means by the saying \"Giving in getting.\"\nThough it was only a little action, I got and learned more in those two minutes than I did in the rest of the month. Everyone in the world needs help. Everyone can give help and everyone can be helped.\nThe look of the man`s happiness appears in my mind whenever I have the chance to do something nice."

      "It is a cold and dry winter morning. When you wake up, you feel that your throat hurts. You begin to sneeze and later you may cough. You must have a cold! Wait a moment. Could it just be a common cold or the flu   that's been going around?\nA cold gives you a runny nose and cough. But it's usually easy to deal with. Some take medicine while others drink herbal tea or chicken soup. Usually you feel better after a week.\nOn the other hand, the flu can be much more dangerous. It usually gives you fever. Sometimes it can cause death. According to an American magazine, the worst flu killed about 50 million people from 1918 to 1919.\nDon't worry. If you get a flu vaccine  , it can stop you from getting the virus  . Flu vaccines work by giving the body a small amount of flu viruses. This causes your body to develop antibodies  . So next time you get the flu, the antibodies should help you.\nThe flu virus changes every few years. Therefore, there are so many types of flu, such as H1N1 and H5N1. The antibodies for one type of flu can't help us against all types of flu. That's why we need to get the vaccine every year.\nHowever, good health habits may also help stop you developing a cold or flu. Washing your hands often helps stop you from getting viruses. It is also important to get regular exercise and eat healthy food. All these can help you strengthen your immune system  ."

He is good at study and handsome. Everyone knows that he is a genius  of my university.\nHe is kind hearted and is always ready to help others. But he doesn't like others to praise him, because he think what he did is common. There is an old saying: A friend in need is a friend indeed. Wang Tao sets a good example in many parts in my life.\nI remembered that my mathematics was _ at that time, but he was excellent in solving mathematics questions. He often received high scores. Of course, I wished I could reach at his level. Since we talked all day long, he was patient and polite to answer my mathematics questions. Slowly, I made great progress in mathematics. I passed the examination finally. Then we became friends naturally. And now, I still remember his strong will to study.\nWe know that we live in a society, so we need a lot of friends. There are two kinds of friends, good and bad, bad friend may make our life failed, while good ones make our life successful. To me, Wang Tao is a very good friend. I learned so many advantages from him, and I changed more and more excellently.\nWe separated three months ago.

To eat grass, a Swiss farmer Dieter Mueller's cow climbed up a roof to look for fresh grass.\nMueller said the cow was walking on a road behind the house.

Love can, too.\nA pair of 16-year-old American twins, Jack and Jake Moran, stared a program called \"Warm Hearts, Warm Hands\" last month. Their aim was to collect new and used gloves with fellow students at Richards High School.\n\"We started this program a few weeks ago after we saw something on the news about a student who got frostbite riding his bike to school,\" Jack said. \"I just kind of realized that there are so many kids who don't have or wear gloves. The school has started the collection competition among classes, and the class that collects the  most gloves gets a pizza party.\nThe twin brothers talked to other students about their program. Many teachers also joined in, bringing in gloves and encouraging their students to help meet the needs of local community members.\n\"The conversations we are having now aren't so much about what actions we can take, but about _ .This program has really shown me that I don't need to get on a plane and go to help refugees to make a difference.

So Jack made a ball out of old socks covered with a piece of plastic. Every time, the two friends didn't stop kicking and running until very late.\nOn Monday afternoon, John and Jack met again at the old bench. Soon the home-made ball was running across the grass. The boys laughed and shouted happily. The ball was stopped by a boy wearing a nice pair of sports shoes. John was upset when he saw it was Steven.\nThe next morning, John's mother gave him a bill. \"Your uncle sent you a birthday present.\" She smiled. John's eyes grew big when he saw the $100 bill. Later that day, his mother bought a pair of new sports shoes and a real football.\nThat afternoon Steven invited John to play football. Steven did not want Jack to join them only because Jack's sports shoes were dirty. When the game was over, John and Steven walked past the old bench where Jack was sitting. Steven picked up a stone and threw it at him. John, holding his new football in his hands, walked on and did not look back.\nSeveral days later, as John walked past the old bench, he saw something lying under it.

      "\"Who needs a shopping mall if you have Taobao?\" says Wang Lin, 28, a writer in Beijing. Taobao, China's largest online shopping site , has become an important part of Wang Lin's life. She spends lots of money on Taobao.\nA growing number of Chinese Internet users have found the joys of online shopping. Most online shoppers are students or young people. More women shop online than men. Clothing and home-use products  are the most popular online.\nMore than 250 billion yuan was spent on online shopping last year, 80% through Taobao.\nTaobao means \"looking for treasure\" in Chinese. People can find almost everything they need on Taobao, from clothes to books, from candies to DVD players.\nYou may ask if it is safe to shop online. Wang Lin said, \"It's very safe and convenient. Unless you receive the products from the shop owners and are happy with them, they will not get the money. You can also get your money back if you want to return _ .\""

      "While popular in the US,the April Fool's Day tradition is even more popular in European countries,such as France and Great Britain.Although the roots of the traditional tricking are unclear,the French and the British both have their own stories about the origin of the celebration.\nOne story holds that the first April Fool's Day was on April 1 of the year when the king of France introduced the new calendar.This new system placed the day that had formerly been the first day of a new year on April l.Many people were not used to the new calendar and continued to celebrate New Year's Day on what had become the first day of April.Thus,they became the first April Fools.Others began to give funny gifts on the day to laugh at the fools who continued to celebrate the New Year on April 1.\nAn English story about the day,however,says that it began sometime during the 1200s.At the time,King John was in the habit of making roads out of the paths he most often walked along.The people of one particular farm village were aware of this.To _ having their green grasslands and pastures disturbed by one of the king's roads,they built a fence that prevented the king from walking through their countryside.\nThe king sent a group of messengers to inform the villagers that they must remove the fence.Upon hearing that the king was planning to do this,however,the villagers developed a plan of their own.When the king's messengers arrived,they were met by the villagers pretending to be mad.The people just throw things and ran around wildly.The messengers were surprised by this and reported to King John that these people were so mad that there was no necessity of punishing them.So,the villagers saved their farmland by tricking the king.In Great Britain,tradition only allows April Fool's tricks from midnight to noon on April l.Those who try to play tricks in the afternoon become the fools themselves."

      "During the last winter holiday, I went to China with my parents. The five-day trip left me with a deep impression.\nAs the capital of China, Beijing is a very beautiful city with fresh air and clean streets which make the travelers feel very pleased. To my surprise, many people there were learning English. Later I was told that they did so because Beijing would hold the 29th Olympic Games and they wanted most foreigners to understand them. They strictly kept the traffic rules. When there was a red light, no one was seen crossing the street.\nOf all the places I visited, I liked the Summer Palace best. To our surprise, although it was winter when we were there, we still saw green trees and many fresh flowers. The whole park was very beautiful. We visited a very modern football field. We were told the buildings where the Olympic Games would be held were even better than that. I also enjoyed skiing in Xiangshan. Skiing is an interesting and exciting sport liked by many people.\nIn my eyes, China is a nice place and Chinese people are very kind. In Beijing Station, there were so many people, and most of them were going home to spend the Spring Festival--the most important Chinese festival, with their families. Passengers helped each other carry luggage , and they were very kind to foreigners. We were given a card by the hotel we stayed at, on which was the address of the hotel. With the card we never got lost in the city.\nThe five days passed quickly, but the trip left me a lot of sweet memories.\n."

      "The centerpiece of curling is the curling stone. Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851, when William Kay and his sons Andrew and Thomas set up a workshop in Mauchline, Ayrshire, in southwest Scotland. Kays is still owned by the relatives of the founder, and today it is the only curling stone maker left in Scotland.\nUsed in a highly competitive sport, the curling stones are made to exact standards. First, stones are _ and then into round \"cheeses\". Finally, the cheeses are shaped and polished into curling stones in a series of steps.\nEach stone must weigh 44 pounds. Each must have a maximum diameter   of 36 inches. Polishing is done by hand on a wheel using water, diamond-talcum power, and felt. Finishing the stone's \"running edge\" is done entirely by hand with a special kind of paper and a digital measure and magnifying glass  . Lastly, a handle  is fitted into holes on the top of the stone. Stones are computer-matched into pairs. Sixteen stones----8 pairs----are needed for a game, and since curling game field usually have 6 lanes, each game field needs 96 matched stones!\nKays is a small company, employing less than ten skilled workers. Master craftsman and co-owner James Wyllie is skilled at all phases of curling stone making and is also an enthusiastic curler, as well as active member of Mauchline's Burns Club, which meets regularly to honor well-known Mauchline residents."

      "How often do you change your hairstyle or ask for new clothes? Do you care much about fashion?\nA recent survey among high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the US found that Asian teenagers cared more about their appearance   than teenagers in the US.\nThe survey was made in 156 high schools in the four countries. South Koreans cared most about their appearance. They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese, while US students showed the least interest in fashion.\n\"The different results show the differences of cultural backgrounds  ,\"said Sun Yunxiao from the China Youth and Children Research Centre.\nHe explained that in the US there are many different standards   of beauty, so teens are more likely to be confident about their appearance. About 85% of American teens are happy with themselves. Besides, most US students agree that people should follow their own interests rather than those of others.\n\"According to the survey, Chinese students are happy and disciplined  . They have a strong desire to make a difference. But Chinese students depend on their parents too much, so they need to be more independent _ Besides, they should learn how to relax,\" said Sun."

      "Almost all people like flowers. Some people like flowers because of their smells, shapes, colors and so on. Others like flowers because they think different flowers mean different things. Flowers have their own language. For example, red roses mean \"love\" and sunflowers mean \"loyalty \". So people in more than 100 countries have chosen their own _ which say something about their countries' spirit. In 1994, China talked about choosing a national flower. Some people liked the peony  but others liked the plum blossom . They couldn't agree with each other. So it has not been decided yet.\nPeople like to buy different flowers in different seasons. Where do all the beautiful flowers in shops come from? They may come from far away, so their price is higher.\na. Farmers grow flowers in their fields.\nb. Planes or trains or buses take the flowers to different places.\nc. Flower shopkeepers buy flowers from the flower markets. They look after the flowers and throw away the broken or bad ones. They cut the flowers to make them more beautiful.\nd. You go to buy the flowers in the shops. When you buy a flower, you're paying lots of people: the farmer, the driver of the plane or train or bus, the seller in the flower market and the flower shopkeeper.\nSo you'd better keep your flowers from far away for a long time. But how? Why not dry them? It's easy! Sand drying is a way. Dry, clean sand is one of the oldest things for drying flowers. And it's one of the cheapest.\n*Fill a box half-way with sand.\n*Put the flowers on top of the sand.\n*Put the box in a warm, dry place.\n*Leave the flowers there for one to three weeks.\n*Take them out and they will be dry."

      "This year the US will honour  one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from?\nThe answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883).\nThe famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)?\nWith little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing.\nOn the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs.\nThis _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\".\nThe most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style. Only a master like Twain could copy the way a young southern boy talked so well."

This camp is run by the Fresh Air Fund . Since 1877, the fund has helped poor children from New York City spend summers in the country. Each year, over one thousand children, age 6--18,take part in the program. Some stay at the camp; others live with host families. The fund pays all money.\nThe camp is for 8 to 15-year-olds. At camp, children can learn about the stars, see deer and cows and other animals, and go hiking, fishing, and of course swimming. The children learn responsibility  by helping out with chores like making beds and waiting on tables. They also learn a lot from teachers, who are often college students from around the United States and from other countries.\nHost families from thirteen states and Canada offer to have children spend the summer with them. Many of these families have their own children. The visiting children become part of the family. They go with the family on picnics, to the pool or beach, and on trips. The children are from 6 to 12 years old when they make their first visit, and most are invited back. Some of the children and families become friends for life."

      "At present, more and more people are crazy about travelling. Why do people travel?  \"To see more of the world,\" many people would say. But travelling abroad now means much more than that for the growing number of Chinese tourists. Of course it offers us good opportunities to meet people from other countries, learn about their culture and customs.\nAccording to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), more than 1 billion people travelled to another country in 2012. In 2012, Chinese people travelled abroad 30 percent more than in 2011. The prosperity   of the tourism industry can also bring both our country and foreign countries great economic benefits  . Chinese people usually join large tourist groups and visit several countries in one trip.\nChinese people don't just travel for sightseeing. The China International Travel Service Company said that all their tour trips sold out a month before Christmas Day. Stores offered discounts   during that time, so shopping in Europe and the United States is popular among Chinese travellers.\nIn December, China is going through a very cold winter. So many people like to go to some countries in Southeast Asia because the weather there is quite pleasant.\nThe improvement of living standards means more Chinese can travel abroad. But many of them don't have a sense of public manners. A report by Living Social website in March 2012 even listed Chinese as the world's second worst tourists.\nIf you want to change that bad name, remember to avoid the following: littering, spitting, snatching bus seats, line-jumping, taking off shoes in public, talking loudly and smoking in non-smoking areas. Besides, we should learn some necessary manners of foreign countries."

They went looking for him, but with no success. Brownie didn't show up the next day, and by the next week he was still missing.\nCuriously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. He barked loudly. But busy with their own lives, Brownie's family just ignored   their neighbor's nervous little dog.\nFinally, one morning Spotty refused to take \"no\" for an answer. He followed Ted, Brownie's owner, everywhere he went. He barked, then rushed towards a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, \" Follow me!\"\nFinally, Ted followed the dog across the empty lot. The dog led the man to a tree a half-mile from the house. There Ted found Brownie alive. One of his legs was crushed   in a trap. Ted wished he had taken Spotty's earlier appeals   seriously.\nThen Ted noticed something amazing. In a circle around the injured dog, he saw a lot of dog food.

      "To understand why the Earth is warming up , first of all, we need to understand why it is warm. Our planet is covered with atmosphere  . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth. The Sun heats up the Earth's surface. When the heat rises into the air, it is stopped by some special gases  in the atmosphere like CO2, the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm.\nPower stations and cars release   so many greenhouse gases every day. So we can help stop global  warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room, asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy. We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation. For example, ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car. Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees. Because trees take in CO2, they are our best friends when fighting against global warming.\nThe problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day. It may take a long time to find clean energy, such as wind energy. It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down. But every little thing each person can do to save energy and our forests will help. Think about our planet. Think about ways we can help make the Earth a safe and comfortable place for the future."

People say that he lived 5,000 years ago. One summer day, while he was visiting a faraway part of his country, he felt very thirsty. The servants began to make water hot enough to turn into gas for him to drink. Dried leaves from a near plant fell into the water. The king drank some, and found it could make him feel less tried. Also as a scientist, Shen Nong was interested in the new dink. And so, tea was created in 2737 BC.\nDrinking tea has many advantages. It makes people feel less tired, clears heat inside the human body and helps people lose weight. As you add a cup of tea to your daily life, please check the following helpful advice.\nDrink it hot. Tea oxidizes  quickly, so it is suggested that you drink it hot.\nDo not drink too much strong tea. It will probably be harmful to your stomach and make you feel sick if you make the tea too strong.\nThe best time to drink tea is between meals. It may not make you have a strong wish to eat when your stomach is full.\nDo not drink with medicine. It many change the medical result. You can drink tea two hours after you take medicine.\nGreen tea is the best choice for office workers. Why? Because green tea helps stop the bad result of the computer."

      "Have you ever wanted to try on clothes without going to the trouble of getting undressed? If you have, here's the device for you: the virtual  fitting room.\nThe technology, designed by Russian company AR Door, was first tried out in May. When a customer walks into a \"fitting\" room, they'll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror. A camera in the mirror, using Microsoft Kinect, monitors a customer's movement and projects a 3-D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen.\nThe room also uses augmented reality technology. \"Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically,\" the company told the Daily Mail. A customer can spin around to see all angles  of the clothes, and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons.\nAR Door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look. Japanese company Shiseido recently presented its Magic Mirror, a virtual make-up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds.\nHowever, the technology is not perfect. The clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body, rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them. And people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on.\nIn the end, you won't know how something really looks and feels."

      "I felt very sad not to be able to get the ticket for the film Titantic last Friday. I learned in the newspaper that ticket could be bought at the cinema box office   in Richland Hill every day between 10:00 and 4:00. Because I work from 9:00 to 5:30, the only time I could go to the cinema was during my 45-minute lunch time. It is a pity that the cinema is on the other side of the town, and the bus service between my office and Richland Hills is not very good. But if you are lucky, you can make the round  trip in 45 minute.\nLast Monday I stood at the bus stop for fifteen minutes, waiting for a bus. By the time I saw one come around the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip---- so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed, I got on a bus right away and arrived at the cinema in twenty minutes. But when I got there, I found a long line of people at the box office. I heard one man say he had been waiting in line for fifty-five minutes. I found that I would not have enough time to wait in line, I caught the next bus and went back across the town.\nBy Friday I understood my only hope was to make the trip by car.it was not cheap,but I felt it would be worth ot to see the film. The trip by car only took 10 minutes, but it felt like one hour to me. When I reached the cinema, I was _ to see that nobody was waiting in line. But quickly found out that it was because they had already sold all the tickets."

      "People sometimes say, \"It's raining cats and dogs!\" when there is a heavy rain. Nobody has ever really seen cats and dogs falling from the sky, but there have been many reports of other strange things \"raining\" down. In 1956, the people of a town in the USA saw a small black cloud in the sky. It started to rain from the cloud normally, but only in a small area. The cloud then turned white, and fish started to fall to the ground. Most of them were still alive.\nDuring a storm in July 1901, in Minneapolis, people heard something falling from the sky that did not sound like rain. When they went outside, they found all types of frogs covering four streets.\nThere are other reports of strange \"rains\" failing from the sky including worms, insects and snakes.\nCan these strange \"rains\" be explained by science? Scientists usually say that a tornado   has picked up the animals from a river or ocean, carried them for miles, and then dropped them somewhere else. But this does not completely explain all of them. On May 15, 1890, in Italy, there was a rain of birds' blood. Scientists said that flying birds must have been torn   to pieces by strong winds. But if so, why did only their blood fall from the sky , and not other parts of their bodies? And anyway, there were no strong winds that day!"

But as Mr. Baker could not cook, she had arranged   for his sister to come over and spend the weekend looking after him at their home. This meant that Mr. Baker had busy time when he came home from work on Friday evenings. First he had to drive home from the railway station.

      "Andrew Holleman, a 12-year-old boy,loved playing in the open land near his home.The land was wet and forested, and made a home for birds, other animals and many different plants.\nIt made the perfect place for him to study and get to know the nature. He had seen some red-tail hawks, red foxes, wood turtles and other animals. He also found special native flowers.\nSuddenly it was announced that the \"empty\" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it. The plants would be removed, the animals would run away and most would probably die. Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds.\nWhen he heard about the news, he was not happy. He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted.\nAndrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area, and how the houses would affect the local environment. He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters. He also called on his neighbors to _ the building of the houses.\nAlthough he was only 12 years old, he had the courage and wisdom of a person much older. Andrew' s teachers described him as gentle, shy and active. His classmates also admired how much he knew about local animals and plants,and the environment.Each day after school, Andrew went door-to-door, to ask the people to sign, who did not want the houses to be built. In only one month, he got the signatures of 250 people.\nIn the end, the land remained a safe place for birds, animals and plants that belonged there.\nAndrew won many prizes for his brave and great work to stop the houses being built,and thus help save the environment."

I came first in the English and Math exams. A week later, the list came out and it didn't include me. James came to me and said, \"Don't be sad. I know you're excellent!

      "How long are you willing to wait for a webpage to open before you start to lose your patience? Half a minute? A few seconds? Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds--as short as the blink of an eye--is too long for most Internet users.\nA millisecond is one thousandth of a second. People hardly notice such a small time difference, but it does cause them to stop searching, reported The New York Times. \"Without question, nobody likes to wait,\" said Arvind Jain, a Google engineer. \"Every millisecond matters.\"\nNowadays, millions of smart-phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information. With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital \"traffic jams\". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.\nGoogle found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.\nEven so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.\nTrying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions. They laid a lot of fiber optic cables  for sending in high speed; they improved software so it would work more smoothly; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users; all this increased speed.\nNowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet. Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing usually find search results in less than a second. _ ."

They went to the station and bought their tickets. When the train came in, Michael broaden in first and without knowing it, dropped his ticket in the platform as he got into the carriage . Derek, who was close behind saw the ticket fall and quickly picked it up. Without a word to his friend, he put it in his pocket.\nAfter they had been in the train a little while, they heard the ticket inspector coming down the corridor, shouting, \"tickets, please!\" Michael looked for his and of course couldn't find it.\n\"Oh, dear, I can't find my ticket, Derek,\" he said.\n\"Have another look, Michael, it must be somewhere,\" said Derek.\n\"No, I can't find it anywhere. What shall I do?\"\n\"Perhaps you had better hide under the seat, then the inspector won't know you are here.\" So Michael crawled under the seat as fast as he could and lay perfectly still.

The only thing for sure is that the house will be as green as possible.\nThe tree house\nMany architects in the world would like to build a \"tree house.\" Like a leaf, the surface   of the house collects sunlight during the day. The energy can be used to heat water, produce electricity, and even create fresh air for the home. The \"root\" of the house is deep under the ground.\nThe lizard   house\nLike a lizard, changing color with the weather is the most important design of a lizard house. When it's in the bright sun, the cover of the house will turn dark to protect it from strong heat. During dark days, it turns white and takes in as much light and heat as possible to produce energy.\nMeals at home\nIt has gardens on the outside wall of the house. People can plant tomatoes, carrots and green tea on them. So every day in the morning, you just need to walk outside and collect your meals.\nLearning from the past\nLooking to the future isn't the only way to be green.

      "When you hear about trees cut for paper, you might think of your favorite trees in the backyard, nearby parks or wild forests being cut to pieces.\nthe good news is that production and use of paper will not cause forests to disappear. Most trees used for paper come from timberlands . People plant trees here for use. It usually takes 10 to 20 years for trees to grow big enough to be cut down. During _ , trees provide a home for animals and produce oxygen  for the earth. And after people cut down the big trees, they plant small ones again.\nOften, a tree is not cut down for making paper at all. People use the big part for buildings. Paper is then made from the left small part.\nWe also recycle paper--People collect used paper and turn it into new products, likes boxes, newsprint and writing paper, in the factory.

      "In a school some trouble was caused by the students. They are very naughty and didn't obey the school rules.They often fought with each other and they didn't forgive each other. One day a new teacher came to this school. When he heard that, he came up with a good idea.\nHe told each of his students to bring a clear plastic bag and a bag of potatoes to school. For every person they didn't want to forgive in their lives, they chose a potato, wrote the person's name on it, and put it in the plastic bag.\nSome of their bags were very heavy. They were then told to carry this bag with them everywhere for one week. They would put it beside their bed at night, on the seat when sitting in a car or on a bus, and next to their desk at school. Days of carrying the bags around with them made students get to know what a weight they were carrying in their minds. And they had to pay attention to it all the time so they didn't forget it or leave it in embarrassing   places. As time passed by, the potatoes went bad and smelt nasty.\nToo often we think of _ as a gift to other people, and it clearly is for ourselves! If we choose to keep our sadness and hatred   in our hearts, we will have to carry them around all our lives. After that, the students got on well with each other and didn't fight anymore.

      "Goog morning, Ladies and gentleman. My topic is \" _ \".\nNow in the 21stcentury, advertising is more and more important for people. Why? I think it is because through advertising, people, especially the businessmen, can introduce their products to the people all over the world. Because of this, many companies spend a lot of money on advertising. As we all know, there are many advertisements which are very interesting and popular. For example, Michael Jordan made an interesting advertisement for Nike. From this you can see how the companies make their products known to the world.\nPeople can make a lot of money through advertising. It is known that many famous singers and movie stars make money in this way. However, I don't think this is a good way for them to make money, because they are not the professional advertisers, especially those who advertise in medicine advertisements.\nNowadays, advertising not only means making the products known, but also means make ourselves known to people around us. Living today, we have to make people believe in us if we want to do important jobs. But how can this be done? We should first let other people know our good side: the good habits and abilities we have. In short, we should always remember to advertise ourselves to others. As I said before, advertising is not only important for companies but also for everyone, for all human beings. This is the most interesting thing about advertising."

      "Rock climbing  did not become a sport until late in the 1900s. But now it has become a popular outdoor activity. While rock climbing may still be necessary for mountain climbing, most people just climb low mountains for fun.\nIf you have ever done rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing both need practice. What most people don' t know is that rock climbing is one of the sports that depend on your body and mind .\nTo climb successfully, one must use wonderful skills. One of the important rules is to always have three parts of your body on the rock face. Another important rule is that your arms only hold you close to the rock face while your legs are pushing you up, the closer you are to the rock face, the easier it is to climb.\nRock climbing is a wonderful sport. Once you start to learn how to climb, you'll find more fun. People who like games such as chess playing or problem-solving may love rock climbing, because they are nearly the same in the way of thinking. For anyone who wants to get into beautiful shape, rock climbing is a fun and good way. Anyone who enjoys a difficult game and loves the outdoors should think of taking rock climbing as a new hobby."

The United States has started a project called the International Children's Digital Library. It is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Library of Congress and the institute of Museum and Library Services.\nThe goal of the project is to offer more than 10,000 children's electronic books in at least 100 languages. Some of the books show the similarities and differences in ways of life around the world. They will enable children to have a better understanding of other people's cultures. People working for this project have tried to design easy ways to search the collection and read the books. A picture of each page appears on the computer. Users can also print the pages on paper if they want to.\nThe project is for two main groups of users. The first group is children between the ages of three and thirteen, along with their teachers and parents. The second group is researchers of children's literature .

      "Many Chinese people like American country music( ),such as  the songs of John Denver. But still some people don't know when country music began.\nCountry music is from the folk music  of the Appalachian Mountains in the east of America. There, people sang while playing the violin and guitar. They sang about everyday life, love and their problems. So the songs were sometimes a little sad.\nOne of the most popular country music singers is John Denver, who is also quite famous to the Chinese. For Denver, music was a language that could bring the world together. He says music can bring people together. We will understand  each other better through  music. People are different in colour and they may speak different languages, but people are the same in mind and body . All of them love music and can understand music.\nThe world lost a great man when John Denver died in 1997. But his music and words will live on."

      "In today's world, sleep experts say that for a better night's rest, Americans should turn off their smartphones or iPad before sleeping. Such electronic products make the brain more active, and then influence their sleep. But according to a latest survey, more than 90% of Americans regularly use a computer or some other kinds of electronic products in the hour before bed.\nResearchers are finding that man-made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals  that help sleep. The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle.\nIn the study, the researchers let volunteers read, play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring  how much light their eyes received. They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22%.\nStudies of students using computers at night have got the similar results. And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness, but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes  and other diseases.\nTo be on the safe side, the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed, or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible.\n."

My citizens and I are holding a big party under the sea, though you wouldn't believe it. But please do not feel excited, you should feel sad because we have to live under the sea. Because of the pollution, the earth has been completely destroyed, from top to bottom. The atmosphere has no oxygen and moisture. As a result, the plants are burned by the strong sunlight with a great number of harmful rays. Of course, none of them are still alive. Not only no green, but also the temperature reaches about 121degC all day even in winter because there is too much CO2 circling the earth.\nOn the land, there is no life. Luckily, the sea is not destroyed by human. So, we have to move into the sea. At the bottom of the water, people have built many new cities. There is a lot of advanced(,) equipment in each city. Computers are used to control all the machines, even the people's life. We can also make the seawater into fresh water. There are two machines making oxygen. If they stop working for only one minute, more than 10 million people will die.\nThe population of our city is over 30 million and, of course, it is quite crowded. We have lots of high buildings and bridges. The roads are wide, too. Our cars are small UFOs, don't be surprised, it is true. At the bottom of the sea you can't see anything, because there is no light all day. However, we have advanced lighting equipment so that we can see the \"sun\" under the sea. Of course, the advanced lighting equipment is very expensive. And if it doesn't work, we can see nothing under the sea. What should we do then?"

Is it just because their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents liked hot food,or is there any connection  between spices and healthy food?\nScientists think that it is because spice plants have some important chemicals .These chemicals can kill bacteria .\n\"Most common spices can kill 75 to 100 percent of the bacteria in food,\"explains one of the scientists.The bacteria grow more easily and spoil(...) food more quickly at higher temperatures.For this reason,it is more difficult to keep food from spoiling in hot climates,\nDo you like your food spicy? Your answer probably tells something about the country you are from.If you like spicy food,it is possible that hundreds of years ago,when there were no fridges,people in your country started using spices to keep the food from spoiling.The traditional spicy dishes helped those people to live longer,healthier lives.Today,in a time of fridges,the spices just make the food taste better."

      "Most students, who are learning a foreign language, like to choose Homestay when they study abroad. Others also prefer homestay even if they go on a visit or a holiday in another country. Presently,homestay has become a form of accommodation( ) which is very popular all around the world. If you want to\nstay at a comfortable and home-like house and experience the life of local people,\nyou can book a homestay on the Internet before you go abroad. It is easy for you to pick out a host family that you want to live with from all over the world. So what is homestay? And what makes it so popular nowadays?\nHomestay means living with a foreign family or \"host family\" as we stay abroad. It is usually called a home away home. There are three ways of doing it:\nChoose to learn English in a language school near your homestay where you\nlive ;\nHave your English classes in the house with a member of family who is a qualified    teacher;\nDon't have any classes at all when you visit a foreign country-a popular\nchoice if you want to be a tourist for example.\nEven in the busy summer period the organization that provides the homestays will always try to place you with the most suitable  host family to meet your needs. With the help of the organizations, you don't worry about where you live, your interests, your language level, eating habits, medical care and anything else you may have during the homestay.\nThough the price of homestay is,mainly depended on your needs, high-quality homestay accommodation can be relatively economical . And if you want your homestay in or near the city center, you may pay for an extra amount of money. Even if you stay further out. you can expect your journey into the center not to Go beyond 30 minutes.\nNot only does homestay accommodation represent  value for money,it also gives you an excellent opportunity to practice the foreign language with your host family. This is a very important extra for students who like to speak as much language as possible. But if you plan to learn English. Why not have your English classes in your host family? There's no better way to learn languages than this because it makes learning and accommodation together as well as the cultural experience!"

      "Scientists have found a new use for children's imaginations --to make Stomachaches go away.\nThe BBC reports a new study that shows: \"Children can be taught to use their Imaginations to deal with stomachaches.\" This may be very good news for parents who need a quick cure for their sick children.\nAny mother or father understands the stomach problem is one of the most frequent  things their children complain about. Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for.\nThis new research is especially good for kids with active imaginations. Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away.\nThe researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy  situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the \"guided imagery\" method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment.\nStudy leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings. She believed that it was a very cheap and easy way to stop children's stomachaches. She said it would not work as well with adults."

They often clean their rooms. Some students do the housework five times a week. They often clean the floor . Some students help their parents on the farm. They think their parents are too busy, so they help them.\nThe results for \"wash clothes\" are interesting. Some students wash clothes once or twice a week. They often wash clothes on Saturdays or Sundays. Some students wash clothes three to four times a week. They only wash their own  clothes. But most students wash their clothes once a week. And they wash clothes on Sundays.\nLiu Ying, a girl in Class 6, Grade 8 has lots of housework to do. She washes the dishes and cleans the floor every day. She often cooks.

Facing lots of difficulties in getting a job, he said, \"I'll take this job. At least I can make some money for my gas.\" Then every day, he drove his car, his 18th birthday gift, to work in the supermarket. He did that for three months.\nLater, he heard that a newspaper was looking for a network technician ,so he asked for it. But they were also worried about his school education He practiced his skill right in front of the computer, and showed the managers the web pages he had made.

Here are some Americans talking about slow food.\nKaren:I'm very excited because I start to run my own business--a new snack bar called Good Food. It is special because we only have slow food. What is slow food? Well, it is more than just healthy food. Show food is also about growing food in a good way so that the environment is not hurt. Come and try my food--I think you'll like it.\nMark: I'm a farmer from California. I grow food in a special way--a way that is better for the environment. I sell a lot of my food to the restaurants and snack bars in the city. And I also visit schools a lot and try to teach children about food, for some kids think that fast food is the only food.\nJoshua: I had the best lunch with my friend Susi in the slow food snack bar last Thursday, I had the great tomato and cheese salad--much better than a pizza and a Coke. A farmer came to our school to tell us about slow food . which I had never heard of before. And now I want to find out more about it on the Internet.. I think it's really a good idea.

      "When I was a little girl, my family lives in a small village. There was a very beautiful river near my home. The water was clean and cool. I liked to go fishing there with mom. We would catch fish, look for clams and play in the water. There were also a lot of  birds near the river. We would spend all day watching the birds. Life was beautiful and wonderful in the old days.\nNow my family lives in the city. Last Sunday my daughter asked me to take her to see the beautiful river I was always talking about. \"I want to go fishing there with you and Grandma ao much,\" she said.\nWhen we went to the river, we only saw a factory and a mountain of garbage . My mom was surprised, my daughter was quite _ and I was sad--the river was my best friend. I grew up with it. Now there are no fish in it; the birds are gone, too. I hear it crying for help.

      "Are you happy most of the time? Or do you easily get angry sometimes? Everyone has a different temperament . It is usually believed that both genes  and environment may affect people's temperaments in different ways. Scientists have found that the season of the birth also plays a role.\nScientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students need to finish a questionnaire . The purpose of it was to find out which of four kinds of temperaments they most had. From the questionnaire, scientists found that the students always answered something like \"My mood often changes for no reason.\"and \"I love to deal with new projects, even if it is risky.\"These answers were then matched with their birthdays.\nThey discovered that people born in summer easily change between sad and happy moods compared to people born in winter. Those who always feel positive are mostly born in spring and summer.\nThe study also found that those born in autumn less probably had a mood of _ which may easily drive them to cry, while those in winter were not easier to be angry.\nScientists said that this was probably because the seasons had an influence on certain chemicals in the human body. And the chemicals are important to control people's moods even in adult life.\n\"It seems that when you are born may increase or decrease your chance of developing certain mood disorders  ,\" lead scientist Xenia Gonda told the Telegraph.\n."

Make sure that if someone breaks any rule , he or she should be _ .\n*Have regular meetings. For the first time, you should make sure that all the members attend.

      "friend wasn't around .Here's our advice to her----and to all kids who feel lonely sometimes.\nIt's hard when a best friend isn't around----maybe because she moved to a different school or a different class. You may feel lonely at break or lunchtime. You want to have new friends, but how do you make them? Maybe it seems like everybody else already has their friends. But remember, there's always room for more friends.\nStart by looking around your classroom ----think about which kids you'd like to play with at break. Look for chances to say hi to them,smile,and be friendly .Offer to share something or express your appreciation  to them. Invite someone to play with you or say\" Do you want to sit here?\" in the lunchroom. When you're at break,walk over to kids you want to play with ,act friendly, and say \"Hi,can I play,too?\"or just join in.\nIf you have trouble doing _ or if you're feeling shy, ask your teacher to help you make new friends. Teachers are usually pretty good at matching up friends. The best way to make friends is to be a friend. Be kind, be friendly,share,say nice things, offer to help----and pretty soon, you'll have one, or two, or even more new friends.\nYou might still miss that special best friend. But when you see each other, you can share something you didn't have before she left: You can introduce her to your new friends!"

One day late in the afternoon, while working to support his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby pond .He dropped his tools and ran to the pond. There, up to his neck in the water, was a terrified boy, crying and struggling to free himself. Obviously the boy did not know how to swim. Fleming jumped into the pond and quickly swam toward the boy. He saved the boy who could have been a terrible death.\nThe next day, a very cool carriage pulled up to the Scotsman's house. A well-dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Fleming saved the day before.\n\"I want to repay you,\" said the nobleman. \"You saved my son's life.\"\n\"No, I can't accept any payment for what I did,\" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer.\nAt that moment, the farmer's own son came to the door of the farmhouse, confused by who was visiting them.\n\"Is that your son?\" the nobleman asked.\n\"Yes,\" the farmer replied proudly.\n\"I'll make you a deal. Let me take him with me. I promise you that I will give him a good education. If the boy is anything like his father, he'll grow up to be a man you can be proud of.\"\nAnd he did. In time, Fleming's son graduated from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London and went on to become a famous doctor.\nYears later, the nobleman's son became seriously ill. Who saved him?

      "You may know the saying: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. A recent study by the Chinese University of Hong Kong has discovered another saying: An apple a day keeps old age away.\nThe study involved fruit flies(g), as they share many genes  with humans. Researchers gave one group of fruit flies normal food, and another group of fruit flies got the same food including apple.\nThe results showed that flies that ate apple lived an average of 55 days longer than the flies that didn't eat apple. The study also found that apple-eating flies were more able to walk, climb and move about as they became old, the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry reports.\nThe researchers believe that the antioxidants  found in apples are good for health.\nIn another experiment, researchers studied the diets of thousands of women. They found that those women who often ate apples were 20 percent less likely to have heart disease.\nScientists have recently discovered the apple's genetic code . This allows scientists to make new kinds of fruit that are healthier. Researchers are already using this information to grow apples with added antioxidants. Antioxidants help to keep eyes and joints  healthy and protect against heart attacks and cancer.\nApples that help people lose weight may be in supermarkets in just four or five years. They are said to be \"extra healthy\" apples that can stop people from overeating."

      "Dou Kou, a Chinese boy, is called \"the youngest writer in the world\". He has written 3 books so far. Dou Kou was born in Jiangsu Province in 1994. When he was 7 months old, his parents started working in over 30 different cities, such as Xi'an and Shenzhen. This kind of life gave him things to think and write about.\nWhen Dou Kou was 9 months old, he could speak and at the age of one he could say five to six hundred words. At 3, he could look up words in the dictionary. At 4, his father taught him to learn something. His parents like reading very much. So does he. At the age of 5, he began writing fairy tales.\nHis fairy tales are all from his life. One day, he found many mice in the house. They not only ate their food but also hurt his mother's hand. So he thought, \"If we give mice the stomachs (  ) of cows, they'll eat grass and it'll be helpful to people. \" This was his first fairy tale \"Change Stomachs for Mice\". At 6, he wrote a novel about his own life in different cities with his parents.\nNow, he studies well in a middle school. He has written his third book, the novel called \"Eyes of Childhood\". He says, \"I am not different from other children. I just wrote several books,"

      "Blind imitation   is self-destruction. To those who do not recognize their unique worth, imitation appears attractive: to those who know their strength, imitation is unacceptable.\nIn the early stages of skill or character development, imitation is helpful. When I first learned to cook, I used recipes   and turned out some tasty dishes. But soon I grew bored. Why follow someone else's way of cooking when I could create my own? Imitating role models is like using training wheels on a child's bicycle; they help you get going, but once you find your own balance, you fly faster and farther without relying on them.\nIn daily life, imitation can hurt us if we subconsciously   hold poor role models. If, as a child, you observed people whose lives were bad, you may have accepted their fear and pain as normal and gone on to follow what they did. If you do not make strong choices for yourself, you will get the results of the weak choices of others.\nIn the field of entertainment, our culture glorifies celebrities. Those stars look great on screen. But when they step off screen, their personal lives may be disastrous. If you are going to follow someone, focus on their talent, not their bad character or unacceptable behaviors.\nBlessed is the person willing to act on their sudden desire to create something unique. Think of the movies, books, teachers, and friends that have affected you most deeply. They touched you because their creations were motivated by inspiration, not desperation. The world is changed not by those who do what has been done before them, but by those who do what has been done inside them. Creative people have an endless resource of ideas. The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; it is what to do with the material knocking at the door of imagination.\nStudy your role models, accept the gifts they have given, and leave behind what does not server. Then you can say, \"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors\" tragedies and stories, and know that they are cheering on."

      "Can you remember a world before the Internet? If you answer is \"no,\" then you are probably a millennial. Millennials are the new generation of young Americans. They were born between 1982 and 1992. There are 33 million of them, and they are just starting to enter the workforce . Many experts believe that millennials are different from young Americans of past generations. They also believe that millenials will change the workforce in important ways.\nHow are millennials different? They are the first generation born in the computer age. The internet has always been a part of their lives. They spend about 16 hours a week on the Internet, and this doesn't include e-mail. And they spend 72 hours a week using other electronic media , including mobile phones and video games. They are \"nation speakers\" of the language of the computer age. People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language. Why not? They did not grow up \"speaking\" it.\nHow will millennials change the workforce? To answer that question, it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet. They use the Internet to communicate. They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day. They share ideas, music, information, games, and friendships with people all over the world. When they start working, they will want to share their work and ideas with others.\nIt is also important to understand the way millennials grew up. Thair parents and teachers gave them a lot of attention. They taught them that their opinions were valuable . As a result, amny millennials are very cinfident. At work, they will expect their co-workers and bosses to listen to their opinions.\nMillennials also grew up with a lot of structure in their lives. Many of them went to school from the age of two or three and played on sports teams. At work, they will expect the rules to be clear. They will also expect a strong but fair boss, like a coach on a sports team. They will follow the person in charge   if he or she is fair. But they will not follow an unfair boss. They will also expect their work to be fun and creative, similar to their experience on a sports team.\nThese are a few of the changes that experts believe millennials will bring to the American workforce. But the world is changing very fast. There will probably be more changes that are difficult to imagine today."

Scientists mark one molecule \"A\" and the other molecules \"B\". According to which and how many molecules are on the red cell, scientists divide blood into four types: A, B, AB and O.\nScientists have been wondering if there are some links between people's blood types and their personalities, but they don't know for sure yet.\nBut some say that people with the same blood type may have things in common.\nPeople with type A: They look peaceful from the outside. But they ask too much of themselves so that they may be very nervous inside. They get happy or sad easily. Sometimes they are shy but always very careful. They can easily win people's trust.\nPeople with type B: They have strong minds. Once they start a task,they don't give up easily. They'll try their best to finish it and do it well. Type B people always try to make themselves different from others. They want to do things in their own way.\nPeople with type AB: They are maybe the strangest among all blood types. They can be both open and shy,noisy and quiet at the same time. They are responsible and always ready to help others.\nPeople with type O: They are open and good at making friends. They always start tasks but don't always finish them. They have lots of new ideas and love to be the center of attention. They always strongly believe in themselves."

      "You change the channels for the fourth time and realize that once again there's nothing on television that gets your attention. Not a problem! Throw on some running shoes and comfortable clothes and go for a run.\nOne of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don't need expensive equipment . All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment. But just because you don't need much equipment don't be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy. No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training.\nRunning makes your heart, lungs, and muscles stronger. It makes you know more about your body. Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen  intake, so you don't get sick easily. It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly.\nHow do you take part in the sport if you don't know much about it? Most schools offer cross-country and track programs, but there are also running clubs open to all ages. A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area. The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun. They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies.\nRunners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be. If you go to a race, you'll see people cheering for all the runners, from the first place finisher to the last place finisher. Running isn't always about how fast you are or how far you're going. It's about getting out there and doing it. Taking part is more important than competition, and effort is recognized over gift.\nIf you're looking for more than just a sport, running may be the perfect choice for you."

      "When a cake is brought to the table at a birthday party, it is usually decorated with candles. It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true.\nIn order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.\nThe tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten.\nTraditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday.\nToday's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers. One or two candles in the shape of numbers are sometimes used instead of lots of candles; for example, a four-shaped and a zero-shaped candle would represent 40."

She visited Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and her family's native place   Romania where 5,000 fans came to see her at the airport. Alexandra said, \"When it all started, I was moved. It was very exciting and I loved the traveling, but I got very tired. And I missed home.\"\nAlexandra is a good student. Her studies always come first. She only starts painting after she's done her homework. She works on two or three paintings at a time. The paintings sell for thousands and Alexandra's parents have given up their jobs to work for their daughter. Life for the Nechita family is very different from what it was like a few years ago.\nAlexandra's father Niki left Romania for political reasons in 1985. At first he tried his best to learn English and had different kinds of low-paid jobs. In 1987, he brought his wife and Alexandra, who was then 18 months old, to America. The family was very poor. Alexandra began to draw at the age of three.\nShe was drawing for four or five hours a day. Soon people offered to buy her paintings and she had her first art show at the age of eight. Stories about this child appeared in the newspapers and television. They now live in a large house with a swimming pool. Her mother said, \"We started without anything, but thanks to Alexandra, we have everything we ever dreamed of.\""

      "It's back to school time for kids in New Jersey, but it's not back to bullying time. There is a new _ law in New Jersey starting this school year.\nNew Jersey's law says bullying is not allowed for any reason. All public school workers, from teachers to headmasters, must be trained in how to prevent bullying. Schools must report any bullying at once, and they will be graded on how well they deal with the problem. New Jersey is one of 47 states with anti-bullying laws for schools. Only Michigan, Montana and South Dakota do not have such a law.\nThere are many kinds of bullying. It may include laughing at others, calling others names and leaving someone out. It can also be physical. The behavior happens over and over again, and can take place anywhere, from the playground to the Internet. It's reported that nearly half of all kids will experience bullying in school, and at least 10 percent are bullied regularly.\nEach year in October, many people begin to pay attention to bullying and try to do something to stop it. Many schools hold anti-bullying programs.\nWill stronger anti-bullying laws change the behavior forever? Ken Trump, president of the National School Safety and Security Services, says no. \"State anti-bullying laws do not provide more money, or other support,\" he said. Some people note that they had strict anti-bullying policies in place long before the law passed. \"The law will not change what we do, because we already take this matter very seriously,\" explains Bruce Winkelstein, the headmaster of Brookside School in New Jersey.\nYou can do your part by treating others kindly and speaking out against bullying. Kids will make the biggest difference of all."

Let's hear some teen readers talk about it.\nZhou Zhijie, 15, from Shanghai:\nI have heard that although Senior 3 is a hard year, Senior 1 and Senior 2 are less _ . I hope there'll be time then to enjoy sports. There will be plenty to see. Especially, the World Cup in Brazil is coming. We can watch football matches. I'm sure I'll really enjoy it.\nJin Xi, 16, from Harbin, Heilongjiang:\nI really enjoy science. I visit many science exhibitions. I am interested in UFOs, too. I'm crazy about making model planes, although I'm not very good at it because I don't really have enough scientific knowledge. I'll be learning more science in senior high school. In a word, sometime in the future I'm going to build an excellent model plane!\nWang Yaling, 15, from Xiamen, Fujian:\nI hope I can be taller in senior high school. I'm only 155cm. Many people grow faster in senior and I hope I will, too. I want to be 162cm. But I'm not sure about that, since most girls in my family don't grow taller than 160cm. I hope I'm different.\nZhang Fang, 15, from Hebi, Henan:\nI expect that I'll make more friends in senior high school. I study in a middle school in the country. Most of my classmates live nearby. In senior high school, I'll meet different people from different areas. I hope I can learn new things from them.\n,."

      "The weather is getting warmer and warmer. It is fun to play outside, but people are afraid to play outside these days, because of the H7N9 virus. The H7N9 virus is one type of influenza A H7 viruses. It is a new type of bird flu. Influenza A H7 viruses mainly affectbirds but sometimes they can also affect humans. Most people infected with H7N9 virus look like they had a common flu. They had a fever, a cough and shortness of breath. Some had bad pneumonia. This March, H7N9 virus hit Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Up until April 11th, the number of people infected had reached 35. Nine of these people died.\nBut don't be afraid , some cases are curable. A 4-year-old boy in Shanghai and a 67-year-old man in Hangzhou got the virus, and they are getting better. Besides, it's not easy to be infected by the H7N9 virus.\nThere are some ways to save ourselves from this. First, wash your hands with soap and running water before you eat and after you use the toilet. You should do the same after you touch animals or animal waste. Second, cover your nose and mouth with your elbow when coughing. Third, you should have a good rest and do some exercises, so your body can become strong enough to beat the virus."

      "Millions of people around the world cook their food on fire every day. People must spend lots of money on cooking _ . However, there is a much easier and cheaper way to cook food using energy from the sun.\nSun-cookers have been used for centuries. A Swiss scientist made the first sun-cooker in 1777. Today, people are using sun-cookers in many countries around the world. People use them to cook food and to heat drinking water.\nThere are three kinds of sun-cookers. The first is a box cooker. It is designed with a special wall that collects sun-shine into the box. A box cooker is good for slow cooking of a lot of food.\nThe second kind of sun-cooker is a panel cooker. It has several flat walls that concentrate the sun-shine on the food. People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars.\nThe third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.\nYou can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper. They will not catch fire. Paper burns at 232degC. A sun-cooker never gets hotter than that. Sun-cookers cook food at low temperatures over long periods of time. This allows people to cook food and do other things at the same time."

      "English breakfast is a very big meal --eggs, tomatoes, tea, coffee....\nFor many people lunch is a quick meal. In cities there are a lot of sandwich  bars ,where office workers can buy brown or white bread or a roll  ,and then all kinds of salad and meat or fish to go in the sandwich. School children can have a hot meal at school, but many just take a sandwich, a drink and some fruit from home.\n\"Tea\" means two things. It is a drink and a meal , some people have afternoon tea, with sandwiches, cakes and a cup of tea.\nThey usually have the evening meal quite early, between six o'clock and eight o'clock, and often all the family eats together. On Sundays many families have a traditional lunch. They have chicken, pork,... with potatoes ,vegetables...\nThe Englishmen like food from other countries too, such as French, Chinese, Italian and Indian. People often get take-away meals---they buy the food outside and then bring it home to eat."

      "Some British and American people like to invite friends for a meal at home. You should not be upset if your English friends don't invite you home. It doesn't mean they don't like you. Dinner parties usually start between 7 and 8 p.m. and end at about 11. Ask your hosts what time you should arrive. It's polite to bring flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine as a gift. Usually the evening starts with drinks and snacks . If you want to be extra polite, say how much you like the room, or the pictures on the wall. But remember-it's not polite to ask how much things cost. In many families, the husband sits at one of the table and the wife sits at the other end. They eat with their guests. You'll probably start the meal with soup or something small, then you'll have meat or fish with vegetables, and then dessert , followed by coffee. It's polite to finish everything on your plate and to take more if you want it. Did you enjoy the evening? Call your hosts the next day, or write them a short \"thank you\" letter. British and American people like to say \"thank you, thank, thank you\" all the time!"

      "Andrew Engel was puzzled. He was sitting in class, but had no idea what the other students were talking about. He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. \"Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,\" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school.\nHe felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, \"What's for dinner, Mom?\" after he had just eaten. Poor Andrew, he was only 15!\nHis parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor. A brain scan  made it clear: Andrew had a malignant brain tumor  . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory. He should be operated on as soon as possible. Andrew was _ !\nDoctors removed the tumor, but Andrew's memory was still poor. He was told he would probably never go back to school. Andrew was eager to enter a university, but it seemed that his dream wouldn't come true.\n\"Even though they told me this, I knew I wanted to go back to school,\" Andrew said. \"I wanted to get my memory back.\"\nAndrew began by auditing  an English class at a nearby school. In class, he took notes carefully and read his notes several times a day, then typed them again and again. He studied twelve hours a day, seven days a week. He worked ten times harder than other students. In 2007, at age 29, he graduated from a local university. Six months later, Andrew found a job."

      "On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, a middle-aged ,rich white South American lady found herself sitting next to a black man. She called the cabin stewardess over to complain about her seating.\n\"What seems to be the problem, Madam?\" asked the stewardess.\n\"Can't you see?\" she said. \"You've sat me next to a black man. I can't possibly sit next to this kind of human. Find me another seat!\"\n\"Please calm down, Madam,\" the stewardess replied. \"The flight is very full today, but I'll tell you what I'll do---IWill go and check to see if we have any free seats in Club or First Class.\"\nThe lady had an unfriendly look at the outraged black man beside her.\nA few minutes later the stewardess returned and said to the lady with a self -satisfied smile, \"I'm sorry, Madam, this Economy is full, and Club is also full. However, we do have one seat in First Class.\"\nThe lady could not help looking at the people around her. But before she had a chance to get up or make any answer, the stewardess continued , \" We seldom make this kind of upgrade ,however, and I had to report it to the captain .When the captain heard this,he said that it was not proper to make someone sit next to such an obnoxious person.\" Having said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said, \"So if you'd like to get your things, sir, I have a seat ready for you...\"\nAt this time, the people around stood up and clapped their hands. The black man walked up to the front of the plane.\nThat was an unforgettable flight for me, for I was the black man who had never flown First Class before."

      "Good morning. The program today is about music. The word \"music\" comes from the Greek word \"muse\". The Muses are the goddesses of the arts. The Music is only one of the arts. It is like the spoken language, but it uses sounds. Today's program brings together music from different concerts of the world. Who invented music? Who sang the first song? No one knows exactly the answers to these questions. But we know that music plays an important part in almost everyone's life. Babies and young children love to hear people singing to them. When they are a little older, they like to sing the songs they have heard. When children go to school, their world of music grows. In the middle grades, students take music lessons. When they reach high school, they become interested in listening to pop music.\nThe records we have chosen for you today are from American country music, Indian music, pop music and so on. Music has meaning for everyone. It can make people happy or it can make them sad. In this program we shall study the language of music. We shall be trying to find out more about how music works. We shall try to find out how music says what people feel.\nNow, here comes the music today , I shall explain why they are all good music."

Across the country, more and more fathers are looking for the answer to the question: what does it mean to be a good father today? And they choose to attend Father School.\nSet up in 1995, Father School began in Seoul. It was to help Korean men show love to their families. Most of the students are from 30 to 70 years old. They are asked to write letters to their kids as homework and to practice saying \"I love you\" to all family members.\nLike many students in Father School, Edmond Rhim never wanted to come. \"I'm not a bad father,\" he said. \"But it was just difficult for me to communicate with my two teenage kids.\" He began to show up in class, and things got better.

      "Great news! Archaeologists  confirm that the tomb found in Xihu township of Yangzhou belongs to Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. Do you know Emperor Yang Guang? He is considered as one of the worst tyrants  who brought the Sui Dynasty to an end in Chinese history. But in fact, he started the construction of the Grand Canal  to connect the North and the South, making Yangzhou a transportation hub  city.\nAs we know, Emperor Yang loved Yangzhou very much. Throughout his life, he paid three visits to Yangzhou. On his first tour to Yangzhou, he stayed here for eight months. And the second time, he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle in Yangzhou. He watched the song and dance shows all day and stayed in Yangzhou for nearly a year. The third time, he enjoyed himself drinking wine without planning to go back to the capital. It lasted for almost one and a half years. In the year AD 618, Emperor Yang was killed by his followers in one of his palaces in Yangzhou, and the Sui Dynasty ended.\nEveryone complains that the Sui Dynasty ended because of the Grand Canal. However, it is still an important way for people to travel. In the year AD 605, Emperor Yang ordered the canal to be dug. Digging such a long canal proved to be very difficult. 3.6 million people worked on it and in less than a year many of them lost their lives. When the construction was completed, the journey from the north to the south became more direct. It is the longest canal in the world. It runs from Beijing to Hangzhou, covering a distance of nearly 1,800 kilometres and joining five rivers including the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Even today, the Grand Canal still plays an important role in travel. Every day, ships go up and down the canal, carrying things between the north and the south."

      "\"AN Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue   of one,\" wrote famous British author George Mikes. While this sounds funny, it's a popular English stereotype  . From the supermarket to the subway, queues are a common sight on the streets of Britain.\nHere in China, queues are normal, too. It is a part of everyday life. People queue most of the time, from buying tickets in the cinema to waiting for seats at a restaurant.[:ZXXK]\nBut in certain situations, you'll find yourself in the middle of a rushing crowd, such as getting onto the subway. Even away from the busy subway platform  , queues are different. One day I was standing in line at the supermarket.\nI left a small space in front of me. Within seconds, a girl walked by and took her place in that small space.\nI was surprised at first, but later I found these experiences very interesting. It is with these small, everyday differences that I get to live and learn within a new culture.\nBack in Britain, the average person spends six months of their life waiting in a queue, according to the auction site MadBid. To pass the time, maybe they tell themselves the famous proverb: good things come to those who wait."

      "When he was small, Hill was a famous bad boy.\nAt the age of 9, his father married his stepmother. At that time they lived poor in the countryside while his stepmother was from a wealthy family.\nHis father introduced Hill to his stepmother as he said, \"Dear, I hope you notice in the entire shire this is the worst boy, who has made me have no other way. Maybe before tomorrow morning he will throw a stone at you, or do a bad thing you will never ima gine.\"\nTo Hill's surprise, his stepmother went up to him with a smile, held up his head and looked at him carefully. She then turned around to tell her husband, \"You're wrong. He is not the worst boy in the entire shire, but the cleverest and creative boy. Only he doesn't find a place to show himself. \"\nHis stepmother's words warmed his heart, his eyes full of tears. With this, he started building friendship with his stepmother. And this became the drive of his life, making him create 28 successful golden rules, which helped tens of thousands of ordinary people walk on the road to success.\nBefore his stepmother came, no one praised him smart, and his father and neighbors considered him as a bad boy. However, his stepmother's words changed his life.\nWhen Hill was 14 years old, his stepmother bought him a used typewriter and said to him, \"I believe you will become a writer.\" Hill accepted his stepmother's gift and expectation, and started writing things to a local newspaper. He understood his stepmother's strong feeling of interest in his family while he saw with his own eyes she had changed his family. Therefore, he would do as well as she expected him to.\nThe strength from his stepmother made him a rich man and famous writer in the United States and one of the most important persons in the 20th century.\nPraise will never be unnecessary, especially for children.

      "Starting from this month, you won't be hearing the word \"NBA\" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport hosts will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product) or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations.\nCCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the \"purity\" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice.\nFu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who proposed the change. \"Using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,\" he said. \"Using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.\"\nBut some experts have a different opinion. Liu Yaoying, a professor at the Communications University of China, said the move shows cultural conservatism . \"If Western countries can accept some Chinglish words, why can't the Chinese language be mixed with English?\" Liu said.\nA lot of people have criticized the move, saying that it will cause problems for them.\n\"I understand what CD, VCD and DVD mean when I hear them. But I won't know what the TV programs are talking about if I hear those products' full Chinese names,\" a person wrote in a BBS post. Following the same post, another person wrote jokingly: \"I'm not listening to my MP3 now.

      "How I study English\nI often hear some students say English is difficult, and it gives them a headache. So they can't learn it well. But English is very easy for me. I'm good at it. I'm very glad to tell you something about how I study English.\nFirst, I think an interest in English is very important. When I was in Grade One, we had a new subject - English. It was fresh for me . I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!\nSecond, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary . Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!\nBesides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.\nNow I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well."

      "People who are about the same age as you are your peers. Peers include your friends and your classmates. They have strong influence on your actions.

A friend might offer you cigarettes .Cigarettes are harmful to your health. Your friend knows that. Your friend also knows that underage smoking is against the law.

For example. a friend might invite you to the movies. You would love to go, but you have a lot of housework to do. In situations like this you should make a wise decision.\nYou can learn to deal with negative peer pressure. Keep away from people who try to influence your behavior in harmful ways. Though it is not always easy to say no, it's really necessary to learn to do that. Follow the following steps. First. look at the person and say no in a firm but polite voice. Make sure your face shows that you are serious. Let the person know you will not back down. Then, give reasons for saying no. Explain why you won't do what the person wants. Remember to say goodbye and walk away if he or she continues."

      "Dear Alice,\nI just received your letter. And I was very surprised to know that you decided to drop out of school and wanted to be a model .\nBeing a model for a living is not easy. In fact, a famous person like me has a lot of problems that you couldn't see. I can't eat what I like, even though I'm very hungry. Keeping thin makes me look more beautiful on the stage because no one would like to see a heavy model.\nBesides, I have to wear a heavy coat in the hot sun, in a swimming suit in the cold air. And practicing walking nicely every day is tiring for me.\nYou might say I made much money from modeling. But my dear niece  , you have to know that money is nothing, knowledge is everything. School is important and everyone should go to school for a certain period of time. The longer they stay at school, the better they will be. Very often, I hope I can give up my job and continue my studies at school. But it is very difficult for me to go back to school again. I am too old to go back to school now.\nYou are a pretty young girl with a bright future. You only have one year to finish your studies in high school. A year is really short. Please do consider my words carefully before you decide. Of course, there is only one thing I care about, and that is your happiness.\nLove,\nEmma"

You have a few minutes to wake up. Next, a tape recorder in the bed plays soft music. The tape recorder in Hiroyuki's bed plays a recording of his girlfriend. She whispered in a soft voice, \"Wake up, darling, please.\" After minutes later, Hiroyuki hears a recording of his boss. His boss shouts, \"Wake up at once , or you'll be late !\"\nIf you don't get up after the second recording, a mechanical \"foot\" in the bed will kick you in the head. The bed waits a few more minutes. What! You're still in bed! Slowly the top of the bed rises higher and higher. The foot of the bed goes lower and lower. Finally you slide off the bed and onto the floor. You are out of bed awake!\nHiroyuki's bed is not in stores. There is only one bed--- the bed Hiroyuki made for a contest. Maybe someday a company will make Hiroyuki's bed and sell it in stores. Maybe people will buy millions of beds. Then Hiroyuki will be rich.

      "How quickly can you count from one to ten?Do you use ten different words to do it?Can you do it in English,or do you have to use your first language?Do you count on your fingers?Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world.But scientists have discovered that it is not true.\nPeople in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers.In the United States,people begin counting with their first finger,which they extend or stick out.They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb to count to five.Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten.In China,people count by using different finger positions.In this way,a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand.\nBesides ways of finger counting,scientists have found that cultures and languages are also different when it comes to numbers.Some languages have only a few words for numbers,and others have no words for numbers.A group of scientists studied aboriginal people in Australia.There people don't have hand movements to stand for numbers.They don't even have words for numbers.However,they are still able to understand different ideas about numbers.\nIn a similar study,researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered that people of the Piraha tribe in northwestern Brazil don't have words for numbers such as\"one\"or\"three\".They are not able to say\"five trees\"or\"ten trees\"but can say\"some trees\".\"more trees\".or\"many trees\".Professor Edward Gibson said that most people believe that everyone knows how to count,\"but here is a group that does not count.They could learn,but it's not useful in their culture,so they've never picked it up.\"\nAlthough all humans are able to understand quantities ,not all languages have numbers and not all people use counting.Number words in a certain language are a result of people needing numbers in their daily lives.Now we know that people have different ideas about numbers and math,too."

      "Very often, new-born babies are not beautiful. They are wrinkled or hairless, or they have an angry look on their faces. They seem to say, \"Get away! I hate everybody.\" But to a parent, that hairless, wrinkled, angry-faced baby is the most beautiful and perfect child in the world. When that proud father or mother asks you, \"Well, what do you think of my baby? Isn't she beautiful?\" what are you going to say? Is the time for the true? Of course not!\nYou look that proud father in the eye and say, \"Yes, she is! She's really a beauty. She's one in a million. She's going to be a movie star! I can tell! She's as beautiful as a picture.\"\nIn English, this is a white lie. White lies don't hurt people. They are not cruel or angry words. People use them to make a difficult thing a little easier. When people don't want to meet someone, or eat something new that they really don't like at a friend's house, they tell a white lie. They are trying to be kind. They don't want to hurt someone. It's important to be honest, but many people feel that being kind is sometimes more important."

      "According to a recent worldwide survey of Internet users, one out of four says they made their most recent purchase  online and six out of ten say friends' social media posts influence their online purchases. Those statistics  have now given some users of the \"Moments\"  function on WeChat the idea of turning their \"friends\" into customers.\nThe \"Moments\" function on WeChat is closed system that allows you to send photos and messages only to your friends. It ensures more privacy  and it helps you avoid receiving spam  from sellers. But some users were quick to see the business opportunities of \"Moments\" and have turned it into a mini-marketplace. They are recommending   products to their friends and offering to either sell the products directly or act as a middleman  for the purchases.\nOne woman told the Shanxi Evening News that she makes money as a middleman, or purchasing agent. She added a few sellers of fake  handbags to her friends list and posts pictures of the handbags. When a friend is interested in buying a bag, they pay her the money and she has the sellers send the goods. \"There are zero costs for storage and logistics ,\" she says, \"and I make money simply from the price difference.\" It's a nice business model, but the woman didn't seem to know that she was doing something against the law by selling fakes to her friends.\nAnother woman was connected with even more dishonest business. She sold facial masks  that had \"magical\" effects to make women's skin beautiful. Unluckily, the masks caused the faces of some of her \"friends\" to break out in red spots and pimples , and when they asked for _ , the woman magically disappeared.\nSocial media is easier to stay connected with friends and to share your experiences with them. And it's OK to \"recommend\" something or try to make money from your friends. Turning your friends into customers is a sure way to lose those friends."

      "Though the ways of teaching have come a long way, the ways of communicating between teachers and students are almost the same. But now, a European country is trying to change that by building schools that have no classrooms, no subject lessons and best of all, no grades.\nThe idea behind the special school is that children are creative. And researchers also think that kids' learning and ideas are as important as those of the CEO of Google, so why not give them a similar environment? Kids may be successful in such an environment.\nTo make kids more creative, the schools are built with special learning areas instead of traditional classrooms. And even the lessons are taught in a special way, with mobile phones and computers.\nThere is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" kind of education. The school believes that everything is a learning experience, whether it is about a serious science project or making a movie inside the school's recording studio.\nOne of the special schools opened in August, 2011. It has five learning areas. The Cave is a secluded place where students fix their attention on individual   projects without being bothered  . The Lab is a place where students can do all kinds of experiments and test their ideas. Kids can work in groups in the same projects in The Camp Fire. The Show Off is where kids can show their inventions. And if the kids need a rest, they can visit The Watering Hole, which has all kinds of fun activities.\nSounds great?

      "Our Needs\nPeople are different, but they all have the same needs. Needs are things people must have to live. Our bodies need food and water. We also need air to breathe. We need a place to live to keep us safe. We need clothes to keep us warm. If we did not have these things, we could not survive .\nNeeds may be different for people who live in different areas. If you live where it is cold, you may need special clothes to keep you warm. If you live where it is hot, you may need more water.\nPeople have found new ways to meet their needs. Farmers grow food that people eat. They used to plant seeds by hand. They used to pick plants by hand. Now they have machines that do this work.\n* Our Wants\nWants are things people would like to have but do not need to live. Suppose you hope to get a football for your birthday. A football is a want. You can live without it.\nSometimes we might want something so much that it feels like a need. We have to make choices, though. If you need a new coat for winter, you might not be able to get the football you want. We must choose what we need over what we want.\nSometimes we must make choices between things we want. Suppose you want to go to a birthday party for your uncle. That day, a friend asks you to go to a movie. The movie is at the same time as the party.\nIf you choose to go to the party, then what would you give up? What would you give up if you went to the movie?"

For him, life was without waves.\nOne day, he was delivering mail as usual.When he looked up in the sky,he suddenly lost his balance.It was a little stone that tripped him up .He observed the stone that had embarrassed  him,finding it strange but beautiful.In his eyes,this stone was like a lost jewel covered with dust. The postman then placed the stone in his bag carefully. Because of this stone's arrival,his day was lightened. He suddenly had a bold thought--I can build a castle with such beautiful stones.How magnificent it will be!\nHis ordinary life started to be different since then. He still delivered mail,but he collected every stone he could find along the way.All those dusty stones,in his eyes,glittered like diamonds.\nGradually,his small bag couldn't hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them.People didn't understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones.\nAfter collecting enough stones,he started to build his castle.During the daytime,he passed along the dreams of others;and during the nighttime,he built his own dream.No one was willing to join in.But the postman was unmoved,still happily building his castle.Because he knew,the dream and the castle only belonged to him.\nAfter 20 years of working day and night,the postman's dream castle was finally completed.It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined.It was a miracle arising from the ordinary.\nThis is a real story.The postman's name is Xue Waller.The stone castle has become a famous tourist attraction in France,which is called\"ideal palace of Ferdinand Cheval.\"At the entrance of the stone castle,there is a sentence--\"I want to know how far a dream stone can go.\""

      "Zoos are places where different kinds of animals are Kept and shown for the public. At most modern zoos people can see, smell and hear animals in their natural way. Some zoos even have \"friendship farms\" where people can touch some of the animals. Here are four reasons why people need zoos.\nFirstly, zoos educate people about animals and their natural environment. They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses. However, today people prefer to see animals behaving naturally.\nSo a modern zoo is a place where animals are well cared for."

Follow this short lesson about self confidence.\nHenry Ward Beecher was a well-known American churchman, social reformer  and speaker in the middle of the 19th century. When he was a young boy in school, he learned a lesson which he never forgot.\nOnce he was called up to recite  in front of the class. When he recited only a few lines, the teacher interrupted with a forceful \"No!\" He started over and again the teacher shouted, \"No!\" Ashamed, Henry sat down.\nThe next boy rose to recite and had just begun when the teacher shouted, \"No!\" This student, however, kept on reciting until he completed it. As he sat down, the teacher replied, \"Very good!\"\nHenry was angry. \"I recited just as he did,\" he complained to the teacher.\nBut the teacher replied, \"It is not enough to know your lesson, you must be sure. When you allowed me to stop you, it meant that you were uncertain, if the world says, No! it is your business to say Yes! and prove it.\"\nThe world will say, \"No!\" in a thousand ways.\n\"No! You can't do that.\"\n\"No! You are wrong.\"\n\"No! You are too young.\"\n\"No! You don't have the education.\"\n\"No! You don't have the ability.\"\n\"No! You don't have the money.\"\n\"No! You can't work it out.\"\nAnd each \"No!\" you hear has the possibility to weaken your confidence bit by bit until you give up all together.\nWhen the world says, \"No!\" to you, you should be strong-minded to say, \"Yes!\" and prove it."

      "Dolphins are one of the cleverest animals in the world. We may hear of many stories about how dolphins save people out of water.\nDolphins often eat fish and some other sea animals. A dolphin with a weight of 200kg to 250kg will eat 10kg to 25kg of fish every day. They like to swim with other dolphins and usually hunt in groups.\nDolphins have very good hearing. They use it to find things under the water. Many scientists also believe dolphins can even talk to each other through a special whistle . People from different areas don't speak the same language. Just like people, dolphins' whistles have many kinds. One day we may understand dolphins' whistles, and then they will be able to tell us about themselves.\nDolphins live in the sea, but they are not a kind of fish and they don't lay eggs. They have babies in the same way as cows and cats do, and give their babies milk. A female dolphin has a baby every two to three years.\nDolphins are very friendly. Sadly, there are not many kinds of dolphins left. People killed them for many years for food and other things. Now it's time to stop this and perhaps there will be more of them in the years to come."

      "Started in 1636, Harvard   University is the oldest of all the colleges and universities in the United States. Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were opened soon after Harvard.\nIn the early years, these schools were nearly the same. Only young men went to college. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin and Greek. Little was known about science. And few people knew that one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them became ministers or teachers.\nIn 1782, Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later, lawyers could study in Harvard's law school. In 1825, besides Latin and Greek, Harvard began to teach modern languages, such as French and German. Soon it began to teach American history.\nAs knowledge increased, Harvard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects. Students were allowed to choose the subjects that interested them.\nToday, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are made up of smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There's so much to learn that one kind of school can't offer all."

The two big Asian countries now work more closely on border problems, trade   and IT.\nIndia is an interesting and mysterious( )country with a long history. Around 2,000 BC, Indian civilization   was born. It is one of the four oldest civilizations in the world.India is also the birthplace of  Buddhism  .A famous  Chinese novel, \"A Journey to the West\", is about a Chinese monk   who tried very hard to learn about Buddhism from India.\nThe book comes from a true story. Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk was sent to India by the King of the Tang Dynasty.After many years, he brought back lots of Buddhist books. The name \"India\" was first used by Xuanzang in his work.\nToday, religion  is still an important part of Indian culture. There are many religions there. Most Indian people believe in Hinduism  .In India, cows are very special animals because  Hinduism  says they are holy  . So Indians don't sell or eat beef.Like China,\nIndia is a developing  country with a large population . It has  about 1.03 billion people compared to China's 1.3  billion.  More than two thirds of  Indians still live a poor life in the countryside.\nIndia has no birth control so its population is growing fast. By 2030, India could even have more people than China.\nHindi   is the mother tongue of Indian people. But Britain took India in 1757 and stayed there until 1947.

Develop a safe walking route to school and insist that your children follow it. Avoid having them cross busy streets except where there is a signal or a crossing guard. If your child does not make it to school or home and if you have a standard route, it will be easier to track them down.\nHave your children walk with others. This may seem a simple rule, but it is one that is often _ . A boy or a girl alone is a much easier target for a predator . Make sure the children walk in a group. And besides, it is a lot more fun for them.\nFollow generally smart pedestrian rules. Remind them to use sidewalks where possible.

      "7 January, 2014\nA new report says more and more international students are attending colleges and universities in the United States. It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China.\nThese findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier. On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas  increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year.\nThe report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents.\n\"Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever.\" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\n\"We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.\"\nChinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy-two thousand students.\nWhy do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason.\n\"The advantage America has is that we have a huge system  and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students.\nForeign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education. And from Learning English, that's the VOA Special English Education Report. I'm Bob Doughty. Thanks for listening."

      "Confidence is very important in daily life. It can help you to develop a healthy attitude. A study shows that the people who are more confident are much happier. They can have more chances to make themselves successful. But how to be more confident. Here are some suggestions:\nSpeak loudly When you are not confident, you can't do well what you want to do . You speak in a voice so low that other people can hear you. Try to speak aloud enough so that people can hear you clearly. The high voice can help you become more confident.\nPlay sports  Physical exercise makes you tired but completely relaxed. When you are athletic, you will be full of confidence.\nEncourage yourself Write down a list of things you did during the day and see how many things you have done well. Did you finish your homework? Did you tell a joke that made everybody laugh? Give yourself praise for the good things you've done.\nGet rid of  fear Fear comes along with failure  . But it's easy to get over if you know that failure is a part of your life. Don't hide your head just because you said something foolish last time. Try to start again and believe you can do better.\nPick up a hobby   If you like singing, singing as much as you can. In some ways, a hobby can make you outstanding.

      "My favourite great book is The adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--read it! I know you'll enjoy it, too."

      "Some inventions are so useful, but seem so simple, that we wonder why no one thought of them long ago. Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention.\nPost-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages.\nAround that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark.\nA short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate. Soon, co-workers were asking Fry for more samples of his invention so that they could use the new type of notes themselves.\nFry and some other people at 3M believed so much in the new product that they persuaded the company to give away thousands of the \"sticky pieces of paper\" for trial use . When some salespeople at 3M went to offices and showed workers just how helpful the new type of notes could be, they immediately received many orders. As more and more people discovered how useful Post-it Notes could be, the product _ ."

      "Dear Liz,\nMy stay in Thailand has certainly been the experience of my life. Life is busy and exciting.\nBangkok is just like any other big city with a population   of 10 million and heavy traffic.\nI'm very lucky because my host family is in a nice quiet area outside the city. There are Mr and Mrs Phairat, their son Sanan, who is 18, the daughter Chinda, who is 16, and Grandpa and Grandma.\nI go to an international school with Sanan and Chinda. The school teaches about 70 percent in English, and 30 percent in Thai. I've learned some spoken language, but Thai writing is very difficult. The cooking lesson is my favourite. I'm learning all about Thai food and culture. People don't use chopsticks   here, but spoons and forks.\nLast weekend we drove to Pattaya Beach near Bangkok. I thought it was great, but Sanan and Chinda said that next month they were taking me to Phuket Island, where the beaches are even more beautiful. The month after next, we're going to travel to Mr Phairat's hometown in the north of Thailand. The Phairats own land there, and they have two elephants. I'm going to ride those elephants and even wash them.\nI'm amazed by everything in this country, especially by the elephants. Elephants are an important part of Thai culture and way of life. They have been a traditional _ of Thailand for many years.\nI'll tell you all about my Thai boxing   lessons next time I write.\nLove,\nMandy"

      "Sun Liping, 6 , lives in a small village in Yunnan. Her biggest wish is to have running water in her home. All 35 families in Sun's village have a serious problem--- they don't have enough water. Every day, the villagers have to walk 20 minutes to get water.\nLast year, the worst _ since the 1950s hit Yunnan, making more than 2 million people short of drinking water. This year, the drought is even worse.\nNot only Yunnan, but many other provinces in China are short of water as well, such as Gansu and Qinghai.\nAccording to a report on February 17, each Chinese person has about 28% of the world's average  person's amount of available  water. Two thirds of China's cities are short of water and nearly 300 million people in rural areas don't have safe water for drinking.\nEvery drop of water is important. Waste a drop of water a day and you lose a bucket  a year. How can we use water in a smart way? Here are some tips for you to save water in your daily life:\n1. Put plastic bottles of water in your toilet to cut down the water waste when you flush   your toilet.\n2. Don't keep the water running while you're brushing your teeth or washing your face and hands.\n3. Use low-flow  shower heads .\n4. Use a bucket to collect shower water while you wait for it to warm up.\n5. Make your shower time shorter.\n6. Set up a rain bucket to collect rainwater for watering plants or flowers."

      "Do you know how it is when you see someone yawn   and you start yawning too? Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, obviously it's because we have mirror neurons   in our brains.\nPut simply, the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains model after it, whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions,they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.\nMirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains,but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages,and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: \"The hand took hold of the ball\"), the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).\nAny problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning  . However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.\nResearch into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information about how humans behave, communicate and spend time together. Indeed, it may turn out to be nearly the same important thing for neuroscience as what Einstein's theory of relativity   was for physics. And the next time you have the strong feeling to cough in the cinema when someone else does - well, perhaps you'll understand why."

      "When you visit Taiwan,Green Island is a wonderful place not to be missed.\nGreen Island,with clear blue water around it,is an island in the Pacific Ocean,33 kilometers east of Taitung. The old name for Green Island was Huoshandao,meaning \"fireburning island\". The island got its name because people on the island used to set up fires at night to help people who went fishing home. Another story goes that in the Qing Dynasty there was a fire and most of the island's trees and grass died. The coastline  of the island is only 20 kilometers long,the tallest mountain is only 281 meters high and the island is only 15 km2,but it is attracting  a growing number of tourists.\nGreen Island has a lot of interests that make it a place where people like to go:seaside,a clean white beach,green grasslands,seawater,hot springs,beautiful undersea sights,and a great many plants and animals. Another thing of Green Island that people are interested in is its rocks in different shapes. \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Pekinese Dog\" are the two most strangely shaped ones.

      "One day a poor farmer was taking a bag of rice to town. Suddenly the bag fell from his horse on the road. He didn't know what to do about it because it was too heavy for him to lift   by himself. He only hoped that somebody would soon pass   by and help him.\nJust at this moment a man riding a horse came up to him. But the farmer was very disappointed when he saw who he was. It was the great man living nearby. The farmer had hoped to ask another farmer or a poor man like him for help.\nBut to his surprise, the great man got off his horse as soon as he came nearer. He said to the farmer, \"I see you need help, friend. How good it is that I'm here just at the right time,\" Then he took one end of the bag, the farmer took the other. They together lifted and put it on the horse.\n\"Sir,\" asked the farmer, \"how can I pay you?\"\n\"It's quite easy,\" the great man answered with a smile, \"Wherever   you see anyone in trouble, do the same for him.\""

      "College is an exciting time to learn and to make friends that will last a lifetime. Many students do not like to worry about money, and they would rather not think about it. But, it doesn't matter whether a student's parents pay for everything, or whether the students work part-time to help pay for his or her education. All students can get into money trouble if they're not careful.\nThe cost of a college education can be quite expensive. In English-speaking countries, the average cost per student per year is well over US$10,000. Students must also pay for books, paper, pens, and etc. These can cost $500 to $1,000 per year. Students who live in university housing pay thousand more per year for room and board . Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses. Are they more than your income? Do you have enough money, or do you need more?\nLearning not to spend more money than you have is not always easy. But for many, it is easier than borrowing money from family or friends."
