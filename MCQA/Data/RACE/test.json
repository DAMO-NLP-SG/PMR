      "Alice's mother died when she was five. Although her brothers and sisters were loving and caring, their love couldn't take the place of a mother's. In 1925 Alice became my mother and told me that her family couldn't even afford her a doll.\nOne afternoon in December 1982, when I was getting ready for Christmas, I suddenly decided to buy two dolls, one for my five-year-old daughter, Katie, and one for my old mother.\nThings went smoothly when a friend told me that his dad, who played Santa Claus in my area, would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home with the gifts! Knowing that my parents would also come to my house, I began to get ready for the most memorable day of my mother's life.\nChristmas Day arrived and so did Santa Claus at the planned time. Katie was very excited and happy all the time to welcome the Santa. My mother was enjoying watching Katie welcoming this special guest. As Santa turned to leave he looked again into his bag and took out one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, without thinking of her name being called, said that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift with a message card that read:\nFor Alice:\nI was cleaning out my sleigh   before my trip this year and came across this package that should be sent on December 25, 1925. The gift inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift.\nLove,\nSanta Claus\nMy mother was very excited and deeply moved to tears. She couldn't speak but only held tightly in her arms the doll she had waited fifty-seven years to receive as tears of joy flew down her face. That doll made my mother the happiest \"child\"."

      "Science isn't something mysterious, only for the few. Every one of us--whether a poet, worker, or physicist has to be able to think scientifically, and to understand some science, such as whether to smoke, what to eat, and what protection to use. Even for decisions that don't depend on some scientific facts, science remains the proven set of best methods for getting exact information about the world. \n   Some people will end up as policy-makers in government or business. People such as these make decisions that affect the life of everyone, and most of them know no more about science than does the rest of the general public. Yet they are called upon to decide what to do about nuclear reactors , global warming, environmental toxins , expensive space programs, and biomedical research. It's nonscientists, not scientists, who have the last word on whether the milk we drink can safely come from cows treated with medicine. To make such decisions wisely, the decision makers have to be drawn from a scientifically educated public. \n   Even if science is irrelevant  to the lives of ordinary Americans, _ . This requires lots of young people to become excited enough by science that they decide to become professional scientists. This also requires, to some degree, the support and understanding of the general public.\nScientists are not always able to communicate their findings in an easy-to-understand manner.

      "Runners in a relay  race pass a stick in one direction. However, merchants passed silk, gold, fruit, and glass along the Silk Road in more than one direction. They earned their living by traveling the famous Silk Road.\nThe Silk Road was not a simple trading network. It passed through thousands of citied and towns. It started from eastern China, across Central Asia and the Middle East, and ended in the Mediterranean Sea. It was used from about 200 B, C, to about A, D, 1300, when sea travel offered new routes  , It was sometimes called the world's longest highway. However, the Silk Road was made up of many routes, not one smooth path. They passed through what are now 18 countries. The routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun, deep snow and even battles. Only experienced traders could return safe.\nThe Silk Road got its name from its most prized product. Silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods. But the traders carried more than just silk. Gold, silver, and glass from Europe were much found in the Middle East and Asia. Horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in China. Indian merchants traded salt and other valuable goods. Chinese merchants traded paper, which produced an immediate effect on the West. Apples traveled from central Asia to Rome. The Chinese had learned to graft  different trees together to make new kinds of fruit. They passed this science on to others, including the Romans. The Romans used grafting to grow the apple. Trading along the Silk Road led to world-wide business 2,000 years before the World Wide Web.\nThe people along the Silk Road did not share just goods. They also shared their beliefs.

      "Black has long been praised for its ability to better women's figures and suit every occasion. But the color has a side-effect--it ages the face.\nWhile black does give the appearance of a slimmer figure by making the shadows less visible, wearing it next to the face brings out a negative effect. Black clothing can highlight   dark lines under the chin, shadows around the eyes and wrinkles on the face. The effect can be as serious as making women feel exhausted, self-conscious and upset. Wrinkles and sunken areas appear deeper and more pronounced, meaning the effect is more obvious in older women.\nDark scarves, hats and high-collared coats are apparently particularly likely to emphasize aging features of the face. But fear not. The effect can be _ by a splash of color around the neck--in the form of a scarf or a piece of jewelry--or a low neckline.\nFamous actress Joan Collins is among the few who can get away with the side-effect. But those who should consider changing their dresses include many European stars. The majority of women who have what is known as a \"warm\" skin tone, based on yellow and gold colors, will not look young and healthy with black against their faces. Warm skins do not match well with black against their faces as it takes away all the golden glow that they have as a basic skin tone. Black looks for dark things on the face and highlights them, particularly as women age.\nThe good news for those who like black dress is that a simple test can help determine whether they can wear black well: Hold the color up against your face, stand in front of the mirror and look for dark lines under the chin, shadows around the eyes or lines on the face that are highlighted. If there are no dark areas or shadows, you can probably wear black close to your face and look great. Otherwise, change your ways."

      "One of the most famous basketball-players in the New Castle's history was paralyzed  in a wheelchair one day...and was walking the next. Citizens of New Castle simply refer to it as \"The Miracle\".\nJoel Haler woke up in his dorm room at Hope College last October totally paralyzed from the waist down. Four hospitals later, the only way he could walk was through Robotic Walking Treatment.\n\"This past Tuesday, I was doing the Robotic walk and lasted ten minutes,\" Joel said. After that, he gave up. Joel wanted to accept the inevitable  and cancelled his next Robotic Walking Treatment appointment.\nThen, the night before his cancelled appointment, he woke up to a terrible pain. An hour and a half later, the serious pain left him with an unusual feeling in his legs.\n\"As it continued to move up my legs, it became more and more painful and it took an hour and a half to reach my hips ,\" Joel recalled.\n\"I stood up and walked into my parents' room. 'Mom and dad, look!',\" he said proudly.\n\"He said something and I was like, 'Joel! Joel! You're walking! You're walking!' We jumped out of bed, cried and hugged,\" Joel's mom Karen remembered.\n\"I burst into tears. It's hard seeing your son not be able to walk, but he was standing there, walking,\" Joel's father Eric said, tearfully.\nIt was Thursday, January 23, when he could finally walk. That date made perfect sense to Joel. He had dreamt of a calendar that only said \"J 23\". He didn't know what to make of it until \"a little boy at church, four years old, came up to me and said, 'you will walk on a Thursday',\" Joel recalled.\nSo the 20-year-old college student, who could only walk with the aid of robot on Tuesday, was walking on his own."

      "No matter where he lives, 16-year-old Danny Lopez feels like an outsider: he is half-Mexican and half-white.\nAt his private high school in wealthy northern San Diego, California, US, Lopez is too brown to fit in, whereas for the Mexican side of his family in National City, just a dozen miles from the border, he is too white to belong.\nDifferent from both sides, Lopez is silent in school. He focuses on his passion for baseball and working hard to improve the pitches   that have kept him off the school team.\nMexican Whiteboy, by Matt de la Pena, is about a teenager's search for identity. It was named as one of the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults in 2009 by the US Young Adult Library Services Association.\nWhen Lopez's mother decides to go to live with her wealthy white boyfriend in San Francisco, he chooses to spend the summer with his father's family in San Diego. It's a trip to explore roots and self-identity, filled with unexpected friendship.\nThere he meets Uno, of mixed heritage   like himself, also with a divorced mom. Uno understands Danny's split background and helps him improve his baseball skills. Both boys have big league dreams, but they both have to learn to come to terms with their mixed heritages before they can achieve their goals.\nAside from discussions of racism, Mexican Whiteboy takes on other issues, such as the importance of family and the negative influence of hiding the truth.

      "Among various programs, TV talk shows have covered every inch of space on daytime television. But no two shows are more opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and Oprah Winfrey shows.\nJerry Springer could easily be considered the king of \"rubbish talk\". The show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.\nLike Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes the TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.\nCompared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.\nClean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main audience are middle-class Americans. Most of the people have the time, money and ability to deal with life's tough problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of a connection with the young adults of society."

I never saw my father stayed home from work ill, nor did I ever see my father lay down to take a nap. He had no hobbies, other than taking care of his family. All he asked from me, his daughter, was to help him while he was repairing something, so we could have some time to talk.\nFor 22 years, after I left home for college, my father called me at 9:00 am every Sunday. Nine years ago when I bought my first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day for three days painting my house. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done. All he asked for was a glass of iced tea. Five years ago, at age 71, my father spent five hours putting together a swing set for my daughter.\nOn the morning of January 16, 1996, my sister telephoned me; my father was in the hospital with an aneurysm  in Florida. I got on an airplane immediately, and on the way I realized that I hadn't communicated with him as much as I'd always wanted to. I vowed  that when I arrived, I would have a long talk with him.

      "The word I'm going to introduce to you today is-phubbing. Let's see the definition of this term:phubbing n. the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your cell phone instead of paying attention As you can probably guess, phubbing is a blend of phone and snubbing. The term was coined by a 23-year-old Melbourne resident Alex Haigh. Obviously, he got fed up with how people are always checking Facebook or Twitter on their phones when they are supposed to be interacting with someone face to face. He wanted to put an end to this social phenomenon, therefore he came up with this catchy term.\nAnd it did catch on. The word's earliest media mention dates back to June 2012, and in a little over a year's time, phubbing has already been picked up by almost all the mainstream media outlets one can think of.\nHere is a typical example from the British newspaper The Independent. In the article titled The Rise of Phubbing, which was published on August 5, 2013, Tom Chatfield writes, there's an uncomfortable truth at the heart of phubbing: other people are easier to handle when seen on screen. They're less likely to demand unreasonable efforts such as undivided attention or clean shirts.\nWhile the term phubbing has undoubtedly taken off, some people question why it is called phubbing instead of phnubbing. Alex Haigh has not personally addressed the issue, but word has it that phubbing sounds more crispy and thus easier to remember.\nPhubbing is indeed a univers al problem that can no longer be ignored. So why do people keep phubbing each other if they know it's rude? Is there anything we can do to stop it? Or maybe we should just be more kind, because sometimes there are good excuses to phub.\nI think there is plenty we can do to try and stop phubbing. For starters, we can jo in Alex Haigh in his Stop Phubbing campaign. Remind our friends and family that phubbing is not appreciated. We can also make or download some anti-phubbing posters to spread the word in public places. And don't forget that some phubbers simply do not realize the harmful effect their behavior has on others,so be b rave enough to stop them, even if you are a total stranger."

      "Nelson Mandela was a figure of international fame, and many details of his life and career were public knowledge. But here are four things you may not have known about the late South African leader.\n1. He was a boxing fan.\nIn his youth, Nelson Mandela enjoyed boxing and long-distance running. Even during the 27 years he spent in prison, he would exercise every morning. \"I did not enjoy the violence of boxing so much as the science of it. I was curious by how one moved one's body to protect oneself, how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat, how one paced oneself over a match,\" he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom.\n2. His original name was not Nelson.\nRolihlahla Mandela was nine years old when a teacher at the primary Methodist school where he was studying in Qunu, South Africa, gave him an English name \"Nelson\" in accordance with the custom to give all school children Christian names.\n3. He forgot his glasses when he was released from prison.\nMr. Mandela's release on 11 February 1990 followed years of political pressure against apartheid . Mr. Mandela's reading glasses stayed behind in prison Mr. Mandela and his then-wife Winnie were taken to the centre of Cape Town to address a huge and exciting crowd. But when he pulled out the text of his speech, he realized he had forgotten his glasses and had to borrow Winnie's.\n4. He had his own law firm, but it took him years to get a law degree.\nMr. Mandela studied law on and off for 50 years from 1939, failing about half the courses he took. A two-year diploma  in law on top of his university degree allowed him to practice, and in August 1952, he and Oliver Tambo set up South Africa's first black law firm, Mandela and Tambo, in Johannesburg. He kept on studying hard to finally secure a law degree while in prison in 1989."

      "If you're in charge of  a project, the key to success is getting everyone to want to help you. As a director, I point, I suggest, I gently push the actors in the direction  I want them to go.\nIn the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot   on a boat, shows Max's despair  about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings.\nJackie had far more experience  at everything than I did, and at first I was frightened (very much afraid). What could I possibly tell \"The Great One\" about acting? Out of fear I decided to direct by suggestion, and I sat down with Gleason to talk about the scene. \"So Max is sad, right?\" I said.\nGleason nodded.\n\"And he's probably still carrying his pens with his name on them --- the ones he used to hand out to his customers, right?\"\nGleason nodded.\n\" So what would you want to do with the pens after you were fired?\" He was silent for a moment. \"Why don't I throw them overboard (or all over the boat)?\" I stood up and turned toward the crew. \" Hey, everybody, Jackie has a wonderful idea. Let's shoot it.\"\nAfter filming the scene, Gleason called me over and said with a smile, \"Garry, what kind of wonderful idea am I going to have tomorrow?\"\nYou and your team can discover the answers to problems together. When there are no prizes or gold stars for who gets the solution (or the way to work out a problem) first, you'll all benefit (or get something of use or value) when everything turns out right."

      "Willie Stewart still remembers his first day of kayaking through the grand Canyon. He was getting bounced around in the roughest white water he had ever seen. There was nothing the river threw at him.\n   There he was in a 40-pound boat, with only a few months of training and one arm. Tied to his left shoulder was a prosthetic limb that he'd had for just about a week. The plan was to paddle  for 20 days over 227 miles of the roughest white water in the United States. It was one of the most remarkable adventures that the Grand Canyon had ever seen.\n  It started with a casual phone call in the spring of 2005. A good friend, Mike Crenshaw, finally got a permit from the National Park Service to lead a private party of 16 boaters down the Colorado River that coming August. He had a slot  open for Willie, \"Was he interested ?\"\n  \"It was the chance of a lifetime,\" Stewart said. He had been waiting years for this trip to happen. \"How could I refuse ?\"\n   But before they set off, Stewart had a couple of things to take care of. He had to get a white-water kayak, learn how to use it, and get an arm.\n   For most of his life, the _ 45-year-old man has lived with only his right arm. He lost his left arm in a horrible accident when he was 18.Stewart was doing a summer construction job inprefix = st1 /Washington,D.C.The trailing end of rope he was carrying got twisted in an industrial fan. Before he could react, the fan reeled in the rope tight and cut his arm just above the elbow.\n   He became a bitter young man, angry at the unfairness of what had happened ,and often got into fights. In time, he learned to channel his rage into sports. He joined a rugby team, established a reputation as a fearless player and eventually was elected captain. His days of rage long gone, he found peace and purpose in his life."

      "Every spring Beijing is choked by huge sandstorms.The sky turns a strange and frightening yellow colour as clouds of sand sweep down from the deserts of Mongolia and north-western China.Strong winds blow up the dust and cover everything in sight--in 2006,a storm dumped 330,000 tonnes of dust on Beijing in one night.\nThe number of sandstorms has grown alarmingly over the years as the deserts have expanded.This is partly man-made and partly because of climate .Many grasslands have been overgrazed by sheep and goats,or ploughed up,leaving the soil dangerously exposed.Too much water has been taken out of rivers,and the situation is made worse by increasingly long-lasting droughts that have affected the northern half of China as the climate grows warmer and drier.The result is probably the worst loss of rich land to deserts in the world and a dust bowl of extremely large proportions.The nearest sand dunes to Beijing are now only 70 km away and drifting closer each year.At this rate,the desert will reach the city by 2040,and Beijing could become the world's first modern city to disappear under sand.To hold back the deserts,a huge programme of forest planting called the Great Green Wall has been under way for over 30 years.The barrier is planned to be 4,500 km long when completed in several decades ,but the drought is having a very bad effect on the trees and the deserts carry on growing."

      "What teaches you more about China: learning the language or making friends with Chinese people? Doing both would be perfect of course and maybe some people would say you cannot separate the two.\n    I arrived in China in September 2010 and have been fortunate over the last year to teach English at a small university in Zhejiang province,about half an hour from Hangzhou.Despite starting with the best of aims to learn Chinese.in each term something seemed to prevent me.In the first term it was a bad cold and judging some public English speech contests,and then my father's death sent me home for a while.\n    But if I miss Chinese lessons this year I will make friends with several of the Chinese teachers at the university who also teach English.It's been a wonderful thing to be welcomed into their lives, to be taken and trusted as a friend.We have dinner together every Fright night,do shopping together, and drink coffee for hours in the cafes at the weekend and talk about anything and everything.\nIt has reminded me that while language is important to understand people and cultures,opening your heart and mind is far more important.I've concluded that in spite of my lack of progress in speaking Chinese, the best foreign Chinese speaker will never understand anything about China if they can't open their heart to the people they live and work with.I,of course,have been lucky that my Chinese friends speak close to perfect English.  \nWhat has surprised me is that many foreign teachers don't make the effort to make friends with their Chinese  _ .Some do,of course,and I am by no means unique.I don't speak much Chinese yet but this never stops me appreciating the best of China:its people."

      ".\nPassage 1\nEvery morning, when we wake up, we have 24 brand-new hours to live. What a\ngift! We have the capacity to live in a way that these 24 hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and to others.\nPeace is right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We don't have to travel far away to enjoy the blue sky. We don't have to leave our city or even our neighborhood to enjoy the eyes of a beautiful child. Even the air we breathe can be a source of joy.\nWe can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available. We are very good at preparing how to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get\n. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with joy, peace, and serenity. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.\nPassage 2\nThe\nof both\nis that we were but to open ourselves to the richness of the moment, to concentrate on\n, we would be filled with bliss. I have lived in the present from time to time and can tell you that it is much overrated. Occasionally, as a holiday from stroking one's memories or brooding   about future worries, I grant you, it can be a nice change of pace. But to \"be here now,\" hour after hour, would never work. I don't even approve of stories written in the present tense. Ads for poets who never use a past participate, they deserve the eternity they are striving for.\nBesides, the\nhas a way of intruding whether you like it or not. Why should I go out of my way to meet it? Let it splash on me from time to time, like a car going through a puddle, and I, on the sidewalk of my solitude  , will salute it grimly like any other modern inconvenience.\nIf I attend a concert, obviously not to listen to the music but to find\nin which to meditate on the past and future. I realize that there may be moments when the music invades my ears and I am forced to pay attention to it, note for note. I believe I take such intrusions gracefully. The present is not always\n, so long as it doesn't stay too long and cut into my remembering or brooding time."

      "The round-the-clock availability that cell phones have brought to people's lives may be _ amily life, a new study suggests. The study, which followed more than 1300 adults over 2 years, found that those who consistently used a mobile phone through out the study period were more likely to report negative \"spillover\" between work and home life--and, in turn, less satisfaction with their family life.\nSpillover(,) actually means that the line between work and home began to become unclear. Work life may invade home life--when a parent is taking job-related calls at home, for instance--or family issues may start to take up work time. For example, a child may call Mom at work, telling her \"the microwave exploded\", explained Noelle Chesley, an assistant professor of society at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and the author of the study. The problem with cell phones seems to be they are allowing for ever more spillover between work and home.\nThis may be especially true for working women, the study found. Among men, consistent use of mobile phones seemed not to allow more work issues to creep  into family time. But for women,  the spillover tended to go in both directions--being \"connected\" means that work cuts into home time, and family issues come into work life.\nCell phones seem to be opening more lines for stressful exchange among family members. But there may be ways to control the spillover, according to Chesley. Employers, she said, should look at their policies on contacting employees after working hours to make sure their expectations are \"reasonable\". For their part, employees can decide that cell phones go off during family time,  Chesley said."

      "Dreams can be familiar and strange, fantastical or boring, but some dreams might be connected to the mental processes that help us learn. In a recent study, scientists found a connection between nap-time dreams and better memory in people who were learning a new skill.\nIn the study,99 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 each spent an hour on a compute, trying to get through a virtual maze .The maze was different place each time they tired--making it even more difficult. They were also told to find a particular picture of a tree and remember where it was.\nFor the first 90 minutes of a five-hour break, half of the participants stayed awake and an half were told to take a short nap .Participants who stayed awake were asked to describe their thoughts. Participants who took a nap were asked about their dreams before sleep and after sleep--and they were awakened within a minute of sleep to describe their dreams.\nStickgold, a neuroscientist ,wanted to know what people were dreaming about when their eyes weren't moving during sleep.\nFour of the 50 people who slept said their dreams were connected to the maze. Some dreamed about the music that had been playing when they were working ; others said they dreamed about seeing people in the maze. When these four people tried the computer maze again, they were able to find the tree faster than before their naps.\nStickgold suggests the dream itself doesn't  help a person learn--it's the other way around.He suspects that the dream was caused by the brain processes associated with learning.\nAll four of the people who dreamed about the task had done poorly the first time, which makes Stickgold wonder if the dreams show up when a person finds a new task particularly difficult. People who had other dreams, or people who didn't take a nap, didn't show the same improvement."

      "There are a growing number of pet owners who feed their pets on raw, which means, \"uncooked\" meat and bones.  William Burk, a pet food specialist from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), believes that feeding raw meat to pets is against its goal of protecting the public from health dangers, and that raw meat and bones do not have all the required nutrition that a pet needs every day.\nRecognizing how popular these foods are, the FDA has provided guidelines for producers of pet foods which contain uncooked meat for dogs, cats and other pets. The guidelines give rules to protect pet owners and pets from dangers about food safety and lack of nutrition.\nPet owners who feed raw meat and bones to their pets should deal with these products very carefully to protect themselves against possible dangers, says Burk.  Just as when you are preparing foods for human beings, use hot water and soap to wash your hands, containers, and surfaces that come into contact with the food. Don't put your hands near your mouth until you have washed them, and don't allow your pet to touch your face right after it has eaten raw meat.\n\"If pet owners choose to feed bones to their pets, they should watch their pets carefully when they are eating bones,\" Burk says. \"If a pet eats a big piece of bone that won't pass through its digestive system , it is likely to kill the pet.\""

      "Do dogs understand us?\nBe careful what you say around your dog. It might understand more than you think.\nA _ named Rico recognizes the names of about 200 objects, say researchers in Germany. The dog also appears to be able to learn new words as easily as a 3-year-old child. Its word-learning skills are as good as those of a parrot or _ .\nIn one experiment, the researchers took all 200 items that Rico is supposed to know and divided them into 20 groups of 10 objects. Then the owner told the dog to go and fetch one of the items and bring it back. In four tests, Rico got 37 out of 40 commands right. As the dog couldn't see anyone to get clues, the scientists believe Rico must understand the meanings of certain words.\nIn another experiment, the scientists took one toy that Rico had never seen before and put it in a room with seven toys whose names the dog already knew. The owner then told Rico to fetch the object, using a word the dog had never heard before.\nThe correct object was chosen in seven out of l0 tests, suggesting that the dog had worked out the answer by the process of _ . A month later, Rico remembered half of the new names, which is even more impressive.\nRico is thought to be smarter than the average dog. For one thing, Rico is a border collie, a _ known for its mental abilities. In addition, the 9-year-old dog has been trained to fetch toys by their names since the age of nine months.\nIt's hard to know if all dogs understand at least some of the words we say.

      "Any high school students lucky enough to be accepted to Harvard University can easily count themselves among the country's best and brightest. \nThe story of David Boone's journey from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms, certainly stands out from the crowd of his peers. \nDavid, a 17-year-old senior at a MC2 Stem, a high school in Cleveland, Ohio that focuses largely on engineering and science classes with the help of a grant   from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was offered a full-ride scholarship to Harvard in the fall. \nHis family life has been complicated for the past few years after gangs and economic hardships resulted in him being separated from his family and forced to look after himself on the streets and park benches in Cleveland. \nBecause both his grandmother and mother could not afford to house the teenagers, his siblings split up to stay with various family friends, but because of space issues and his allergies   to the families pets, David was unable to stay. He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. \n\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\" he wrote in his blog post.\nDavid's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. \n\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. \nAt MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering. Principal Jeff McClellan found David to be a great student and all-around person, but with a serious living situation, so he stepped in to help. After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. \n     When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. \nDavid's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I realize that's what everyone does before they cry. I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of emotion there.\" he said."

      "Once upon a time, on an isolated island in the Java sea, lived short people who dominated(, ) the food chain. Standing no more than three and a half feet tall, these human ancestors hunted giant rats, lumbering lizards , and _ elephants.\nIt sounds a bit like a fairy tale, but it's true. Unearthed relics on the island uncovered the remains of a race of tiny human ancestors. Homo floresiensis, as the newly discovered species has been named, apparently could date back to 13,000 years ago. This means they have a lot in common with modern humans.\nSo how and why did these people get so small? Scientists suspect that it's due to the fact that this race lived on an isolated island with limited resources. Take the miniature elephants for example. When elephants first came to the island either by swimming or by some kind of natural land raft, they were probably close to full size. But since there wasn't much to eat, over time smaller elephants lived longer and better. The smaller the elephant was, the less it had to eat to stay strong and healthy.\nScientists call this the \"island role\", and it can apply to humans as well as animals. Given the island's sparse  food supply, it makes sense that the early humans living there would have evolved   a body size requiring less food to survive. So bigger isn't always better.\nIn the floresiensis, at least, getting smaller was the way to go."

      "A long road leads through the woods to Don Robinson's unfinished house. Wearing dirty sneakers and a shirt with holes, Don Robinson is an 81-year-old Missouri businessman. Although he's rich, he didn't use his money to buy himself a grand home. Instead, he used it to buy wild land.\nRobinson has decided to donate 843 acres of his own personal _ to the Department of Natural Resources after his death, which can then be used to create a new state park. His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years.\nHow did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air.\nRobinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk. He said he didn't care how much his donation was worth. Tom Pounders who used to work for Robinson said, \"He doesn't think material objects are important.\" He also recalled that Robinson once repaired a broken tennis shoe with a spare tire.\nRobinson has just one request for the new park that will be established after his death. He'd like it to be named the Don Robinson State Park. \"There's a lot of Robinsons, but only one me. It would be nice if people remembered to use my full name when walking through the park,\" he said."

      "When Carlos Westez died at the age of 76, a language died, too. Westez, more commonly known as Red Thunder Cloud, was the last speaker of the Native American language, Catawba.www.ks5u.com\nAnyone who wants to hear various songs of the Catawba tribe   can get in touch with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where, back in the 1940s, Red Thunder Cloud recorded a series of songs for future generations. They are all that is left of the Catawba language. The language that people used to speak is gone forever.\nWe are all aware of the damage that modern industry can do to the world's ecology. However, few people are aware of the effect that widely spoken languages have on other languages and ways of life. English has spread all over the world. Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi have become powerful languages, as well. As these languages become more powerful, their use as tools of business and culture increases. When this happens, hundreds of languages that are spoken by only a few people die out.\nScholars believe there are about 6,000 languages around the world, but more than half of them could die out within the next 100 years. Araki is a native language of the island of Vanuatu, located in the Pacific Ocean. It is spoken by only a few older adults, so like Catawba, Araki will soon disappear. Many languages of Ethiopia will have the same fate because each one has only a few speakers. In the Americas,100 languages also are dying out.\nRed Thunder Cloud was one of the first to recognize the threat of language death and to try to do something about it. He was not actually born into the Catawba tribe, and the language was not his mother tongue. However, he was a frequent visitor to the Catawba reservation in South Carolina, where he learned the language. The songs he sang for the Smithsonian Institution helped to make Native American music popular. Now he is gone, and the language is dead."

This meant doing 365 different things, and it also meant challenging ourselves to go green beyond the easy things. Rather than recycle and reduce our energy, we had to think of 365 diffenent things to do and this was no easy task.\nWith the idea of going green every single day a year,Our Greean Year started. My wife and I decided to educate people about how they could go green in their lives and hoped we could show people all green things that could be done to help the environment. We wanted to push the message that every little bit helps.\nOver the course of Our Green Year, we completely changed our lifestyles. We now shop at organic  stores. We consume less meat,choosing green food. We have greatly reduced our buying we don't need. We have given away half of what we owned through websites.Our home is kept clean by vinegar and lemon juice, with no chemical cleaners. We make our own butter, enjoying the smell of home-made fresh bread. In our home office anyone caught doing something ungreen might be punished.\nOur minds have been changed by Our Green Year.

When I get in the water I float because 80 percent of my body is lungs and my drumstick acts as a propeller  .\"\n         \"He's very modest, but he gets marriage proposals   from women all the time,\" said Nick's friend Steve Appel.\n         \"He would love to get married and start a family, but he's waiting for the right girl to come along.\"\n         When Nick was born his father was so shocked that he left the hospital room. His  _ mother couldn't bring herself to hold him until he was four months old.\n         His disability came without any medical explanation, which was a rare case. Nick and his parents spent many years asking why this cruel trick would happen to them. \n         \"My mother was a nurse and she did everything right during pregnancy but she still blamed herself,\" he said.\n         \"It was so hard for them, but right from the start they did their best to make me independent. My dad put me in the water at 18 months and gave me the courage to learn how to swim.\""

      "I must have been about fourteen then, and I put away the incident from my mind with\nthe easy carelessness of  youth. But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me\nyears later, and ever since have been of great value to me.\nCarl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I\nwas doing. I said three or four hours a day.\n\"Do you practice\n, an hour at a time?\"\n\"I try to.\"\n\"Well, don't,\" he exclaimed. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.    Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\"\nWhen I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice.\nThere is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.\nI admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a tremendous influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I plunge in without delay."

      "In the world today, there are millions of surveillance cameras, or \"spy cams\", watching and monitoring our daily activities. There are some benefits of course, as people who are breaking laws can be watched and caught using cameras and this helps keep our society and public places safe. These cameras are everywhere and most are openly visible on roads, in airports, businesses, shopping centers and government buildings and even in lifts. Even schools have started using spy cams to watch student activity and behaviour.\nThe cameras are so common now that we hardly ever even notice them. But the problem lies with the ones that are hidden away from our eyes and are unseen. Technology has helped develop tiny cameras that can be very well hidden and they can \"spy\" on shoppers, workers, babysitters and people in hotels and clubs without the people even knowing.\nIt is these spy cams that people feel are an invasion of privacy. Recently, in the US, there have been a number of court cases against babysitters whose actions have been recorded by their employers on hidden cameras.\nThe number of cameras in public and private areas is on the increase and with rising crime rates and the recent terrorist attacks, more and more surveillance cameras are being used to watch us. This means that we all have to be aware that our employers, department stores, police and even some of our friends could be spying on us at any time!"

      "British newspapers are among the oldest and most famous in the world. But recently big changes have seen these traditional publications try to fit the modern world. After 221 years, The Times has changed its size to become much smaller. In fact, the paper has cut its size in half from a broadsheet to tabloid . \nIn prefix = st1 /Britainthe newspaper market is divided between the larger broadsheets and the smaller tabloids. These terms refer to the size of the papers' pages but there is also a clear difference in content. Broadsheets such as The Times, the Guardian and Daily Telegraph are serious papers. They cover a broad range of political, economic and international issues. Their stories are also reasonably long and use quite formal language.\nTabloids have far more stories about less serious issues such as celebrities' love lives. Their stories are shorter and use more simple language. Tabloids often have bigger pictures. Britain's best-selling newspaper, the Sun, is a tabloid and has a naked girl on Page Three every day.\nBy changing to the size of a tabloid, The Times is following in the footsteps of a less famous broadsheet paper the Independent . It changed to tabloid last year and saw its sales increase greatly. Although both papers have switched to the smaller size the content of the papers has remained the same. They are both still serious papers. \nThe two papers claim that people find the smaller size easier to handle when they travel to work on the bus or the train in the morning. Instead of calling the new style of their paper tabloid, the paper says its new size is \"compact\" ."

      "America's child movie star Shirley Temple Black died late Monday evening at the age of 85. Her fans in China are also deeply saddened. Temple is just one example of movie stars that China adored, and still adores. Here's our editor's pick of the top movie stars who have influenced China.\n1. Sylvester Stallone\nOh, Rambo! The first strong American man that China knew. His accented English, easily recognizable even for someone who doesn't speak English, and his eyes that never seemed to smile, makes him someone whom cannot be forgotten. He represented the strong American image, and even stirred a boxing and bodybuilding fever in China.\n2.Charlie Chaplin (April 16, 1889 - December 25, 1977)\nIn the 20th century, it is not too much to say that Einstein made the greatest contributions to science, and not many would disagree that Chaplin did the same for film. He was the first actor that introduced comedy to most Chinese viewers, and politically, he was also a close friend of China's. His silent films broke the barrier of language and his form of art was recognized by all. It will be a difficult task to find a person in China who does not recognize Chaplin, even today.\n3. Shirley Temple ( April 23, 1928 - February 10, 2014)\nWhen Chinese audiences saw this adorable child star for the first time on screen, Shirley Temple had already lived for more than half a century. In her movies, she was always alone or in trouble, but this adorable little blonde  could always resolve anything with her kindness, push away the fogginess and bring about light. The brand \"Shirley Temple\" was a product of the Great Depression. People watched her act to forget their hardships as Temple entertained the poor, the rich, adults and children alike. Several decades later, when her films were screened in China, the effects were the same.\n4. Audrey Hepburn( May 4, 1929 - January 20, 1993)\nShe will forever be the princess in Chinese people's hearts. Even to this day, a large number of tourists go to Rome to visit the Mouth of Truth with their lovers and eat ice cream on the Spanish Steps. Her sense of style seems to never go out of style. When she was alive, she was living perfection. Even after her death, she has remained an _ . That's something that only Audrey Hepburn is capable of."

Designers have painted the frames yellow , which researchers say is a calming color . Other cells contain a royal blue line because psychologists believe that the color is likely to encourage truthfulness .\nThe station has 31 cells , including 12 with a \"live scan\" system for drunken or disturbed prisoners , which detects the rise and fall of their chest . An alarm alerts officers if a prisoner's breathing stops and carries on ringing until the door is opened .\nDesigners and psychologists have worked for years on color . Blue is said to suggest trust , efficiency , duty , logic , coolness , thinking and calm . It also suggests coldness and unfriendliness . It is thought that strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter , soft colors will calm the mind and aid concentration .\nYellow is linked with confidence , self-respect and friendliness get the color wrong and it could cause fear , depression and anxiety , but the right yellow can lift spirits and self-respect .\nIngrid Collins , a psychologist who specializes in the effects of color , said that color was an \" energy force \" . She said : \" Blue does enhance communication but I am not sure it would enhance truthful communication . \"\nYellow , she said , affected the mind . Red , on the other hand , should never be considered because it could increase aggression . Mrs. Collins praised the designers for using colors in the cells .

      "The sunflower plant bears bright yellow flowers that always face the sun, hence the name. However, the plant is grown not only for its beautiful flowers, but also for its oil that has a host of health benefits. Sunflower oil prevents diseases, lowers cholesterol levels, keeps the heart healthy, and even prevents certain forms of cancer. Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth, and prevents signs of aging. So, let us know more about its effects on your skin.\n1. It Acts as an Effective Emollient .\nSunflower oil is an effective emollient, which means that it helps the skin retain moisture. Thus, people with dry skin can benefit immensely from the regular use of the oil. Also, it is mild, and provides relief from irritation and inflammation of the skin.\n2. It Offers Sun Protection.\nSunflower oil is a rich source of vitamin E. The high vitamin content prevents the sensitive cells of the skin from being damaged by the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Also, the beta-carotene (b-) present in sunflower oil helps neutralize  free radicals that are responsible for causing damage to the skin, including sunburn and skin cancers.\n3. It Prevents Earlier Aging.\nVitamin E present in sunflower oil not only protects the skin from sun damage, but also from earlier aging. What's more, regular use of sunflower oil can reduce wrinkles and make one look younger. Also, sunflower oil is rich in antioxidants  that keep the skin fresh.\n4. It Prevents Skin Infections .\nSunflower oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids that protect the skin from bacterial infections. Hence, it gives you a healthy skin.\n5. Additional Effects.\nThere are other ways in which sunflower oil can prove to be a boon for your skin. These are given as follows:\nIt helps reduce dark spots; it helps lighten dark circles; it helps soften rough and dry skin; it can be used to remove make-up; it helps relax tired eyes."

      "Do you love Beats headphones, True Religion jeans, and UGG shoes? These are some of the most popular brands   around. They are also expensive. But some experts say they are not much better than cheaper brands.\nFor example, Jim Wilcox works for Consumer Reports. He tested all kinds of headphones. He says that $80 Koss Pro headphones provide basically the same quality   and comfort as Beats. So why do people pay twice or even 10 times as much for the hottest brands?\nExperts say it's because fashionable, expensive brands send a message. Brands say \"I belong\" or \"I can afford it.\"\nSome people think that expensive brand names are worth the price. They say that some designer clothes really are top quality and that they last longer than cheaper brands. Some teenagers choose to wear popular brands because these brands make them feel good about themselves.\nAlexandra Allam, 17, likes to buy brand-name products. \"I'd rather spend the extra money to get something I know I'll be satisfied with,\" she says. Her friend Emmy Swan agrees, saying \"As long as you can afford it, it seems reasonable to buy what you want.\" But not all teenagers agree. \"Spending hundreds of dollars for designer sunglasses is stupid and unreasonable,\" says Daniel Steinbrecher, 16. \"It's fake   happiness.\"\nPeople who are against wearing expensive brand names say that many designer brands aren't any better. \"It's wasteful to buy things just because they are popular,\" says Edmund Williams, 15. \"You'll feel better if you buy things because you like them. If you have extra money to spend, it would be better to give it to people in need.\""

      "My favourite book is The Adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri.He's a lively and clever young boy,and he finds himself in many exciting adventures.He runs away with his two friends,Huck Finn and Joe,to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days.With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave.and finally,they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead.He decides to go to his own funeral.He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in  the 19th century,so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--- read it! I know you'll enjoy it,too."

      "Tokyo University laboratory has developed a robot that never loses at the game of Rock Paper Scissors. That is because its visual processing abilities and fingers work together faster than any human brain. A video of the undefeated robot has been watched by more than 3 million viewers on YouTube since going online at the end of June.\nTokyo University engineering professor Masatoshi Ishikawa has a good-natured response to frustrated human losers who accuse him of essentially creating a robot that cheats. \"It is not cheating. Every one millisecond the image processor decides and recognizes the shape the human hand is going to make. And then the robot can make a winnable shape one millisecond later than a human being. Only one millisecond, but a human cannot see this difference because the human eye is very slow,\" explained Ishikawa.\nAt the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory there has been amazing progress which shows the near perfect accuracy of robotics. Such as a robot that can catch a falling egg without breaking it, another one that can tie a knot, and a robot that may not be quite ready for the NBA, but is able to dribble  a ball.\nIn sports such as baseball and cricket, the misses outnumber(......)successes for even the most skilled athletes. That is not so in this award-winning school laboratory. For instance, an intelligent robot is the result of five years of research and a lot of trial and error. And the cost of just one finger on the robot is equal to that of a mini car.\nThe technology obviously has uses beyond fun and games. Corporations are eager to take advantage of the lab's technology for industrial and other practical uses. And there is talk of applying it to assist disabled people and improve human capabilities."

      "Why does a large education nation like China have so few world renowned scientists as the US? Educationists from China and the US try to find out the answer to questions like this at a forum on the basic education strategy.\nThe forum, held recently, was jointly organized by the Education Development Research Center of the Ministry of Education in China and the Postgraduate School of the University of Pennsylvania in the US. It aims to find out similarities and differences that exist between two countries in their educational system.\nWhile some educationists in China keep a doubtful eye to the country's educational system in recent years. Their American counterparts give a positive answer to the basic education in China, saying that it is still one of the best in the world.\nAn American educationist told reporters that the basic education in the US was criticized in recent years due to its political tendency. On the contrary, Chinese government's stress on basic education and qualified teachers has set a good example.\nAt primary and middle school, pupils in China did better in math and science lessons than the US pupils. However, few grow to be world \"masters\". Why? Educationists attributed this to China's stress on examination rather than students' interest.\nDeputy Director of the postgraduate school of Pennsylvania University said American teachers encouraged students to focus on their strong points. In China, students are driven to study to pass the entrance examination test and they do not pay much attention to their own interest.\nAt the forum, director of the Education Development Research Center Mr. Zhang said in the future, the research center would make its middle and long-term basic education strategy by taking some references from other countries including the US.\nHe also revealed that for a long time in the future, China would make a breakthrough in setting the policy for quality education."

It is not yet known how many people died or were hurt in this storm, but it is said that the numbers will be very high.\nWith the arrival of the tornado season, the National Weather Service is again telling people how to protect themselves from these deadly storms. The winds from tornadoes are the most violent winds on earth. They can blow up to 400 miles per hour. A _ looks like a funnel . It is also very loud. It may sound like a train coming at you. In fact, the winds from a tornado can pick up a train and throw it around. If a tornado is seen in your area, it is very important that you protect yourself. A basement   is the safest place to go. Try to wait under a table in the basement. Stay away from windows. If you are outside or in your car, try to find a narrow place to hide.\nAs the area tries to deal with the worst flood of the century, there are many heartwarming stories of people helping other people. From all over the world people have sent food and clothes to help the thousands who have had to leave their homes. Many volunteers have come to help to make sandbags and use them to build walls against the overflowing river.

      "Eva Mozes Kor has good reasons to look down upon Oskar Groning. When she and her twin sister, Miriam, arrived in the Auschwitz death camp, they were met by Josef Mengele and became part of the cruel scientist's experiments. Groning was a junior squad leader at the camp.\nWhile Groning could argue he was not directly responsible for procedures carried out on twins,nor for the mass murder of so many others, he played a critical role in the effort to kill Jews.\nAfter the war Groning led an ordinary, quiet life until he became alarmed by the rise of Holocaust deniers. He went public with his role and in September 2014 was charged as an accessory  to murder.\nWhen Groning went on trial in April 2015, Eva Mozes Kor was called as a witness. After her session, she walked straight up to the 93-year-old former Nazi and shook his hand.\nEva Mozes Kor will never forget nor excuse what the Nazis did. Her two books make that clear: Surviving the Angel of Death. and the earlier Echoes from Auschwitz. She has also spent her post-war years drawing attention to the Holocaust, in the hope of preventing a repeat of its horrors.\nAt the same time,  she is dedicated ( ) to healing rather than revenge. As she wrote in a Facebook post:\nForgiving does not mean forgetting-we all want to prevent these things from ever happening again. Forgiveness is about self-healing, self-liberation, and self-empowerment... Let's all work together to teach the world how to heal.\nAs a survivor suffering so much, Eva Mozes Kor is a role model for the kind of forgiveness that mends souls, a forgiveness that carries with it the responsibility to work for a world in which such horrors no longer happen."

      "Dear Ms Morris,\nWe have come to know of an unfortunate incident you had with our customer service department and we would like to deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to you by the customer service manager's behavior. We have noted down your complaint (number 797329SA) and would like to let you know that strict action will be taken against the employee. He is a new employee with little experience and so his attitude towards his job was over enthusiastic and he lacked proper judgment.\nWe are by no means excusing his behavior but I would like to request you not to take any legal action against the company as we are very sorry for what happened. To express our appreciation, please accept the offer of free servicing of all products of our company that you own for up to three years. We will also make sure that the faulty  air conditioner is replaced by us at no extra cost so that you do not face any further problem.\nOnce again, we are very sorry for the incident. Please contact us if you have any questions.\n                                                           Yours sincerely,\n                                                              Nate Borges\nDear sir,\nI should like to apologize for the inconvenience caused to you due to poor Internet connectivity. I understand that you require the Internet all through the day as all your business deals are done online and since last week your work has been affected a great deal.\nWe are continually working towards providing the best possible services to our customers. You have been using our service for the last three years and are aware of the excellent quality of service offered by us. However, this time due to some major technical fault the Internet service was interrupted and our customers in your part of the city are facing our poor Internet connectivity problems.\nThe issue is likely to be solved within the next two days; kindly bear with us until then. Once again I apologize for the poor service.\n                                                           Yours faithfully,\n                                                              David Johns"

      "\"Who does the cooking in your home?\" I'm often asked by my colleagues. \"My wife and I share it 50/50,\" I usually say without hesitation.\nIt's a lie, of course. We're pretty much even when it comes to the children and the elderly. But the paying of bills isn't 50/50-my wife pays all sorts of household expenses, so I never even have to set eyes on them. And the cooking isn't 50/50, either.\nThe truth is that I am the cook. On my recent 40th birthday, I received the following gifts from my children: a new pot, two mini bottles of truffle oil, a decorative salad-dressing pourer, and a juice-making machine. For a moment I longed for something more manly, a cricket bat, perhaps, and then had to admit that all these things would be useful for me.\nIt's not that my wife can't or doesn't like to cook (she makes delicious Welsh cakes). Nor has it always been this way. In the early years of our marriage I'd be relaxing with a glass of wine while my wife prepared for dinner after work.\nBut at some point that changed and I became the cook. Ten years with my wife gave me the rewards-I can throw together a roast, and I can make much foreign food. But I have truly become a monster  in the kitchen, unable to keep myself away from cooking. \"You have to add Dijon to the sauce; it brings out the taste of the cheese,\" I volunteer, as my wife is cooking. \"Quick, stir in the butter so the dish becomes delicious.\"\nIs it any wonder that my wife has given up coming into the kitchen while I find the whole process of chopping, mixing, and adding things deeply satisfying?"

      "New York City schoolchildren can't use cellphones at school because of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ban on cellphones in schools. Many parents are opposed to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ban on cellphones in schools by e-mail messages.\nThere was a 13-year-old student who was shot with a gun after school, unable to call his mother for help. There was a high school student robbed three times last year, twice in her school building. There was a girl who got a piece of glass placed in her eye during school and was saved from a possible cornea transplant   only because, having disobeyed the cellphone ban, she was able to call her mother and get an operation on time.\nThe ban has been on for years, but it set off a widespread parental outcry only in April, after some headmasters sent home letters reminding parents that cellphones are not allowed to be brought into school.\nMr Bloomberg has defended the ban, saying that cellphones are bad and often used to cheat or call in friends for fights. If something is important, he says, parents can call schools directly.\nOn the other hand, many of the e-mail messages from parents described the ban as \"cruel and heartless\", \"absurdly  wrong-headed\", \"anti-parent\", \"ridiculous\".\n\"We respect the fears that parents have,\" David Cantor, a spokesman for Schools Minister Joel I. Klein said, \"but after all the fact is that having phones in schools always leads to more problems.\""

      "Take That Tiger Mom\nIn the ongoing battle between Tiger Moms, French Mamas, and everyone else who wants to know what is the best way to raise their kids, a new study adds evidence that the extreme Tiger-style may do more harm than good.\nAuthoritarian parents are more likely to end up with disrespectful children with violent behaviors, the study found, compared to parents who listen to their kids with the goal of gaining trust.\nIt was the first study to look at how parenting styles affect the way teens view their parents and, in turn, how they behave.\nThe study considered three general styles of parenting. Authoritative parents are demanding and controlling while also being warm and sensitive to their children's needs.\nAuthoritarian parents, on the contrary, are demanding and controlling without the appearance of caring, attachment and receptiveness. They take a \"my way or the highway\" approach to their kids.\nPermissive parents, the third group, have warm and receptive qualities, but they set few boundaries and carry out few rules.\nUsing data on early 600 kids from an ongoing study of middle school and high school students in New Hampshire, researchers from the University of New Hampshire were able to find \"my way or the highway\" parenting with more violent behaviors like robbery, drug-taking, and attacking someone else with the intention of hurting or killing.\nFirm but loving parenting, on the other hand, led to fewer lawbreakers. Permissive parenting, surprisingly, didn't seem to make much of a difference either.\nTo explain the link between parenting style and behavior in kids, the researchers suggested that what matters most is how reasonable kids think their parents' power is. This sense comes when kids trust that their parents are making the best decisions for them and believe that they need to do what their parents say even if they don't always like how their parents are treating them.\nWhen kids respect the power of their parents, the researchers reported in the journal of Adolescence, their behavior is better. Previous research has also linked firm but caring parenting with kids who have more self-control and independence.\n\"When children consider their parents to be the reliable figure, they trust the parents and feel that they have a duty to do what their parents tell them to do,\" said lead researcher Pick Trinkner. \"This is very important as the parent doesn't have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present.\""

      "An old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and a four-year-old grandson. The family ate together at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled onto the floor. When he took the glass, often milk spilled on the tablecloth.\nThe son and daughter-in-law became unhappy with  _ . So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl.\nSometimes when the family glanced in grandfather's direction, he had a tear in his eyes as he ate alone. Still, the couple blamed him sharply when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old son watched it all in silence.\nOne evening, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps   on the floor. He asked the child, \"What are you making?\" The boy responded, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up.\" The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.\nFor the rest of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled. Children are surprisingly  _ . Their eyes always observe, their ears always listen, and their minds always process the messages they get. If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives.

      "The students in America usually begin high school at the age of 13 or 14. Some leave at the age of 16. But most finish the 4-year high school study. They do not get their first full-time work or begin college studies until they are 17 or 18 years old.\nThe high school day is about 7 hours long. Part of the day is made into classes of about 50 minutes long. The students have lunch in the middle of the day. American students study English, history, math, science, art and languages. Some also learn job skills. They can learn how to use a computer or how to mend a car. Other students may learn by working in an office, a hospital or other places one day a week.\nJean Wilton Anderson is 16 years old. She lives with her parents and two younger brothers in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington D.C. Jean studies at Walt Whitman High School. There are about 1,500 students at the school. Most of them will go up to colleges.\nJean wakes up early every morning. She begins school at about 7:30. This is her third year of high school. Every day she takes classes to learn English, world history, physics and trigonometry . She also has a class about different religions .And she plays the violin in music class. School ends at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Yet, Jean stays 2 or more hours longer every day for sports. Jean arrives home at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. She eats dinner. Then she starts her homework. Students in America have their way of talking. They use the word \"like\" all the time. Jean and her girlfriends wear blue jeans and shirts or sweaters every day. The boys at her school also wear blue jeans. But they like to wear blue jeans that are several sizes too large for them. \nLike students of her age in most parts of the country, Jean begins to drive a car. She does not have her car. She must use the family's car. Most of the students in high school have their own cars. Many of them drive their cars to school every day."

      "The Streisand Effect\nWhen Barbra Streisand discovered in 2003 that a photograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 photos on the Internet as part of a collection by a photographer Kenneth Adelman, she did what any famous person would do: hit him with a $50 million lawsuit  . But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.\nEver since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the \"Streisand effect\". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  \nThere are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, \"Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home.\" The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called \"Goodbye\", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.\nWe can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with. Unfortunately, a few of them fail to understand it."

      "May 28 (Reuters Life!) - A Japanese university is giving away Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) trendy iPhone to students for free, but with a catch: the device will be used to check their attendance.\nThe project, which is being tested ahead of its formal launch in June, involves 550 first and second year students and some staff of a department at Aoyama Gakuin University, which is located just outside Tokyo in Sagamihara city.\nThe school's iPhones are meant to create a mobile information network between students and professors, but they are also a convenient way for the teachers to take attendance in class. As students enter the room, instead of writing their name on a sheet, they simply type in their ID number and a specific class number into an iPhone application. To prevent students from logging in from home or outside class, the application uses GPS location data and checks which router the students have logged in to.\n\"We don't want to use this to simply take attendance. Our hope is to use this to develop a classroom where students and teachers can discuss various topics,\" professor Yasuhiro Iijima told Reuters as he demonstrated the application.\nUniversity officials insist the project is not intended to infringe on students' privacy or track them down.\n\"With Japanese cellphones it's possible that the location data is automatically sent. However, with the iPhone, you must always confirm before the GPS data can be sent,\" Iijima said.\nMany of the students testing the system said they were happy with it.\n\"Up until now, we've been using little slips of paper to take attendance. But with a cell phone, you don't have to spend time collecting all of those and so I think it's quite nice,\" 20-year-old student Yuki Maruya.\nWhen the system goes fully online next month, the university also hopes to provide video podcasts of lectures to help students who missed classes, or just can't remember their lessons."

      "The cheetah is best known for being the world's fastest land animal, reaching speeds of just over 110kph for short period of time. However, many people know little else about this wonderful animal. The word cheetah probably comes from a Hindi word spotted animal. It is very similar to other cats but also has some obvious differences. Its body is much leaner than most cats and it has much longer legs.\nPeople sometimes make a cheetah a leopard because they both have spots, but in fact they are very different. A leopard is far heavier and more powerful, but also much slower. The cheetah's spots cover most of its body except for its stomach and throat. The cheetah's tail has spots and these become rings at the end of the tail.\nAn adult cheetah weighs between 35-65 kilograms and is about 80 centimeters high at the shoulder. The cheetah's head is quite small and the eyes are quite high up. A black line runs from each eye down to its mouth and makes it look a little sad. It has high shoulders that help it to walk so gracefully.\nCheetahs are very fast but they are not very strong. They are not good fighters and will run away rather than fight another animal to protect their food. If they make a kill, it is sometimes taken away from them by stronger animals such as lions and leopard. These animals will kill their young if they get the chance. The cheetah is not a threat to humans at all. It will not attack humans and prefers to stay away from occupied areas."

      "When, after a year of being alone on his island, Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand, the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles. Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n     Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged  a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe's time."

      "Drownings, bicycle injuries, falls, and pedestrian accidents are the most common causes of childhood injury or death. Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n*      Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n*      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision  \n*      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n*      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding. Obey all the traffic signals."

      "How to protect children Web fans from unsuitable material on-line while encouraging them to use the Internet has long been discussed in the US.\nFor some parents, the Internet can seem like a jungle, filled with danger for their children. But jungles contain wonders as well as danger. With good guides, some education, and a few precautions( ), the wilds of the Internet can be safely navigated. \"Kids have to be on-line. If we tell our kids they can't be allowed to surf the Internet, we're cutting them off from their future,\" said an expert.\nMost kids have started to use search engines. Many of them are great for finding tons of interesting Internet sites, and they can also locate places where you might not want your kids to go. There are search engines designed just for kids. A certain software contains only sites that have been selected as safe. The most popular way would be to use what is known as a \"content screener\". But this can't be wholly reliable( ), and the best thing parents can do is to talk to their kids and let them know what is OK or not OK to see or do on the Internet. Another way is that mum or dad is nearby when the child is surfing the Internet.\nA few other tips:\n--Do not put the PC in a child's room but keep it in an area where mum or dad can keep an eye on things. That also makes the Internet more of a family activity.\n--Ask your child what he or she has been doing and about any friends they make on-line.\n--Tell your child not to give on-line strangers personal information, especially like address and phone number.\nAnd tell your children never to talk to anyone they meet on-line over the phone, send them anything, accept anything from them or agree to meet with them unless you go along."

      "Treetops, the hotel in the trees, are famous in the world. People know little about Kenya, but they know of Treetops. When King George VI died, Princess Elizabeth was staying on the Treetops, and when she came down from there, \"She _ him as the queen of the country\".\nThe hotel is in the middle of the forest, and it shows the pleasure of Africa. When you visit it, you will be sent into the heart of the forest by hotel buses, and then a guide, with a gun to protect you against big game, will go with you to the Treetops. Before and after dinner, for the whole night if you wish, you can sit on the corridor , watching animals come to the water pool. The earliest hotel Treetops was built round a large tree on the opposite side of the water, but that was destroyed by fire and the new hotel Treetops, which is built round several trees, is much bigger.\nThe dining room at Treetops is small, and the waiters cannot walk round to serve guests, so a clever \" _ \" has been invented. Guests take their food as it passes slowly in front of them, along a line in the center of the table.\nThere are many animals around the Treetops. When you visit them, you can see:\n---Animals and their babies are waiting to greet the guests.\n---Animals, enjoying the Treetops pool in the daylight.\n---A long bodied, long ring tailed very active cat-like animal is a special one coming out at night. He hunts and eats anything he can catch and is very destructive. He lives in the trees at Treetops. He comes for his food every evening. Do not get too near to him, as his teeth and claws can do you harm. These animals can be trained and become lovely pets."

      "Homemade Ice Cream in a Bag\nDifficulty: Very Easy\nAverage User Rating:(4.3/5)\nMilk can become homemade ice cream in five minutes by using a bag! This homemade, creamy treat is a summertime delight for your kids and you alike.\nWhat you'll need:\n1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk; 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla  ; 6 tablespoons of rock salt; 1 small-sized plastic food storage bag; 1 gallon-sized plastic food storage bag; ice cubes.\nHow to make it:\nl Fill the large bag half full of ice, and add the rock salt. Seal the bag.\nl Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it.\nl Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully.\nl Shake until the mixture turns into ice cream, which takes about five minutes.\nl Wipe the top of the small bag, and then open it carefully. Enjoy!\nTips:\n1/2 cup of milk will make about one spoon of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. But don't increase the amount more than _ --a large amount might be too big for kids to pick up because the ice itself is heavy.\nHere is another version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent!\nThese are the homemade ice cream ingredients:\n1/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter and nuts; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk.\nThese are the other supplies:\nPlastic sandwich bag; 12 salt pellets; 1 dish of ice; large plastic bag.\nPut the ice cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt and ice in the big bag. Hold the bag shut and move it around on the floor for about 5 minutes.\nWhen I made ice cream at home last time, although the salt pellets didn't really dissolve   that well, I still got ice cream. It was not smooth ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk. It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients)\nNext, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. It was a bit too chocolaty, but good!"

      "When we look at the sky and see a bright light moving quickly across it or coming towards the earth, we talk about seeing a \"shooting star\" or a \"falling star\". These moving lights are not, in fact, stars at all. They are small pieces of matter from outer space, which burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. The correct name of them is meteoroids. Any pieces that make it to the Earth's surface without completely burning up are known as meteorites. A meteor is actually the name given to the light we see when a meteoroid is burning up.\nWhen a meteorite hits the Earth at speeds between 11 and 72 kilometers a second, it can do amazing damage. A very large meteorite could knock the earth out of its orbit. If this happened, all life on Earth would probably become extinct . The path we follow around the Sun would change and as a result the Earth would become either much hotter or much colder. This change in temperature would affect sea levels and the amount of water in rivers. There would either be huge floods, which would cover most of the land with water, or the oceans would dry up and there would be a drought, which means a long period of time without rain. Either way, nothing could survive. If a large meteorite landed in the sea it would almost certainly cause tsunamis, which would race towards the land, destroying everything in their paths.\nAlthough it is unlikely the Earth will be struck by a meteorite large enough to do that kind of damage, there is evidence of fairly large meteorites hitting the Earth in the past. In 1908 a large area of forest in Tunguska, Siberia was destroyed by a meteorite that came apart just before it hit the ground. The moon, however, has about three billion craterscaused by meteorites impacting its surface. The reason more meteorites have reached the surface of the moon than the surface of the Earth is that the moon does not have enough atmosphere for the meteorites to burn up in. some of the meteorites that have reached the Earth's surface have done considerable damage. Some scientists believe it was a change of climate caused by meteorites hitting the Earth that resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs and other large prehistoric animals.\nScientists are especially interested in meteorites because they contain information about the solar system. It is widely believed by scientists that most meteorites are produced by collisions  between asteroids (small planets). These collisions probably happened many billions of years ago. This means the physical and chemical structure of a meteorite can give scientists information about the early days of the universe."

      "Today, Mount Qomolangma's peak is not a lonely place any more. More than 3,500 people have successfully climbed the 8,844m mountain, and more than a tenth of that number reached the peak just over the past year. As more and more people try to test themselves against Qomolangma, many a time the mount can be very crowded. Climbers have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks  on the way to the peak. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.\nBut the dangerous crowds aren't the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of _ --much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world's tallest rubbish dump. Here's mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: \"The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are not only dangerously crowded but also badly polluted.\"\nBut the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma. Mountaineer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition, which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since 2008. So far they've collected over 13 tons of garbage.\nSome of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose. As part of the Mount Everest 8844 Art Project, a group of 15 artists from Nepal collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers. They've changed the cans and oxygen tanks--in one case, part of the remains of a helicopter--into 74 pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal's capital. Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakeers Association, which has helped collect tons of rubbish off the mountain."

      "When people get bad toothaches, they often have to eat soft, easily chewed food. When lions get bad toothaches, they eat people? That' s the conclusion of a zoologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and a dentist who works on carnivores  ., Lions don't normally prey on people. Every once in a while, however, a lion will go on a human-eating diet. The most famous such tragedy happened in 1898, when two lions killed and ate 135 railway workers in prefix = st1 /Kenya.\nExamining the preserved skulls   of the two big cats, zoologist Bruce Patterson and dentist Ellis Neiburger found that both animals had been suffering from several dental and |aw problems. One lion had three missing teeth and a loose, unsteady lower canine that was probably useless. Canines are pointed teeth that hunting animals use for gripping and piercing prey ) .The two lions might have been so badly disabled that they couldn't bite down forcefully, say the researchers. Consequently, the lions might have abandoned their normal, more difficult prey and turned to humans. \"Humans are easy preys, \" said Patterson. \"We're very slow, we don't hear very well, and we don* t see very well in the darkness. \"\nThe research calls their idea the Infirmity Theory. It was inspired partly by the work of Jim Corbett, a tiger hunter in Indiain the 1930s. Corbett was regularly called in to hunt tigers that had been dining on Indian villagers. Time after time, Patterson discovered that the killer tigers were suffering from some ill-healthy conditions."

      "Anyone who doubts that children are born with a healthy amount of ambition need spend only a few minutes with a baby eagerly learning to walk. No matter how many times the little ones stumble in their first efforts, most keep on trying, determined to master their amazing new skill. It is only several years later, many psychologists and teachers agree, that a good number of kids seem to lose their natural drive to succeed. For the parents of such kids, whose own ambition is often tied to their children's success, it can be a painful experience.\nFiguring out why _ is the first step. Assuming that a kid doesn't suffer from a learning disability, or isn't involved in some family crisis at home, many educators attribute a sudden lack of motivation to a fear of failure or classmate pressure. \"Everything is within the kids' control; their intelligence is changeable,\" says Lisa Blackwell, a research scientist at Columbia University. \"More than any teacher or workshop,\" Blackwell says, \"parents can play a key role in conveying this message to their children by praising their effort, and progress rather than emphasizing their 'smartness' or praising high performance alone. Most importantly, parents should let their kids know that mistakes are a part of learning.\"\nSome experts say our education system, with its strong emphasis on testing and separation of students into different levels of ability, also bears blame for the disappearance of drive in some kids. \"These programs shut down the motivation of all kids who aren't considered gifted and talented. They destroy their confidence,\" says Jeff Howard, a social psychologist. Howard and other educators say it's important to expose kids to a world beyond homework and tests, through volunteer work, sports, hobbies and other extracurriculum activities.\n\"The problem of the issue is that many students experience education as irrelevant to their life goals and ambitions,\" says Michael Nakkual, a Harvard education professor. The key to getting kids to aim higher at school is to free them of the idea that class work is irrelevant, to show them how doing well at school can actually help them fulfill their dreams beyond it. They need to understand that you have to learn to walk before you can run."

      "I recall a moment that I experienced with my dad when I was twenty-one. I was going to college and living with a couple of friends in Chicago.\nWhen the car I was using died, my dad, realizing that I needed transportation to get to work and to school, was good enough to lend me the money for a used car. Shortly after I bought it, my parents drove down to San Diego for the winter. Before they left, my dad gave me some of his bank deposit slips   with clear and detailed instructions to put one hundred dollars of my earnings, every payday, into their savings account while they were gone.\nAt that time of my life, I was not yet clear about what were the most important problems that I had to attend to first. I dismissed our agreement as nothing important and continued to spend my money as fast as I was making it, in pubs, on dates, and so on. Instead of honoring our agreement, I made payments that were less than the agreed-upon amounts, and on more than one occasion I made no payment at all. \nWhen my parents arrived home in late March, I got a call from my dad, who said, \"Don't go anywhere. I'm coming over.\" My dad was (and still is) a physical presence and had been a truck driver for thirty-five years. I felt ashamed and guilty, knowing that Dad had discovered that I hadn't held up my end of our bargain. \nAfter he came in, he told me to sit down because he had a few things to tell me. There was no shouting, no red face with a vein about to burst on his forehead, and no bad language at all. His first words were, \"When your mother and I got back into town yesterday, I called the bank. I can't say I was surprised to discover that you hadn't made all the payments. My first thought was to come here and take the car from you, but I want to tell you some things while I'm here. Maybe you'll understand, and maybe you won't.\"\nHe went on to tell me, very calmly, about what it means to keep your word. He explained that when he was growing up after the Depression, a man's handshake and his word meant everything. He also told me that because I was twenty-one, he didn't feel angry so much as sad and disappointed. He closed by saying that our words and actions have a real effect on others, and that my words and actions were what others would measure me by. He added that if I hadn't yet formed some core or basic values and principles, this might be a good time to start thinking about those things.\nFor the first time, I saw real disappointment on Dad's face.\nHe gave me a second chance to make our deal right, and even gave me more deposit slips, saying, \"I will take those keys if you miss a single payment or, at the very least, if you don't let me know in advance that you'll have trouble making a payment.  _ .\"\nHe spoke for about forty-five minutes, and I listened. He didn't expect me to say much, and I knew enough to keep quiet. I just nodded or shook my head at the right time and continued to listen.\nThat time we spent together changed me forever. Then and there, I made a promise to myself that I'd never again be the cause of that look of sadness and disappointment on Dad's face. After that defining afternoon, our relationship got better and better. I'm now married with two sons of my own, and they're already learning about the importance of honor, trust, and honesty."

He ran after a deer, and soon found himself alone. \"I ran after a deer, but I didn't get it,\" he said. \"Then I was really lost.\"\nHe had only his hunting rifle  and the clothes he was wearing.

Then he awoke and relied on skills he learned in a hunter safety course. He followed a stream to an occupied cabin. The couple there called his parents and cooked him a breakfast. \" It's probably one meal I'll never forget for the rest of my life,\" he said.\nAfter DuVall's disappearance, a lot of emergency officials and more than 100 volunteers went searching for him. \"He wasn't sitting there waiting for someone to come and find him,\" said his father, Steve DuVall. \"We didn't find him; he found himself.\"\nMike Kintigh, regional supervisor for the Game, Fish & Parks Department, said one or two hunters will go missing each year, but rarely for more than 24 hours. \"We're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time.

My younger brother Walt and I had decided to go swimming in a deep swimming hole across Mr. Blickez's farm and through some woods, because it would be the only way to cool ourselves down.\nThe only problem with our plan was that this farm was guarded by a huge mean   Hereford bull  . Mr. Blickez had told us that Elsie was the meanest bull in town, maybe even in the county and we believed in him. But the hotter it got, the more we thought there was something _ about what he said. For one thing, we remembered Mr. Blickez liked telling tall tales; for another, Elsie seemed like a strange name for a bull. Finally, I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the farm, and Mr. Blickez agreed.\nOn our way across the farm, we stopped at the fence to admire the swimming hole. The sun shone brightly across the cool waters. We couldn't wait to get there. Suddenly, Walt shouted loudly. Elsie had run to him and was licking   his back. I immediately hid under the fence. However, when I looked up, I saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull at all. She was just a friendly young cow, and she was going to keep licking my brother's back as long as he stood still.\nWhen we discovered the truth, we were so happy. We then ran to the swimming hole and jumped in. The water was just as wonderful as we had dreamed. After that day, we had many good days and we often visited our secret swimming hole guarded by the so-called \"big mean bull\". ."

      "What does it mean to say that we live in a world of persuasion? It means that we live among competing interests. Your roommate's need to study for an exam may take priority   over pizza. Your instructor may have good reasons not to change your grade.\nIn such a world, persuasion is the art of getting others to give fair and favorable consideration to our points of view. When we persuade, we want to influence how others believe and behave. We may not always _ -- other points of view may be more persuasive, depending on the listener, the situation, and the merit of the case. But when we practice the art of persuasion, we try to ensure that our position receives the attention it deserves.\nSome people, however, object to the very idea of persuasion. They may regard it as an unwelcome interruption into their lives. Just the opposite, we believe that persuasion is unavoidable -- to live is to persuade. Persuasion may be ethical   or unethical, selfless or selfish, inspiring or degrading. Persuaders may enlighten our minds or get our vulnerability . Ethical persuasion, however, calls on sound reasoning and is sensitive to the feelings and needs of listeners. Such persuasion can help us apply the wisdom of the past to the decisions we now must make. Therefore, the most basic part of education is learning to resist the one kind of persuasion and to encourage and practice the other.\nBeyond its personal importance to us, persuasion is necessary to society. The right to persuade and be persuaded is the bedrock of the American political system, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution  ."

      "Two thieves came to a house to steal something. They dug a hole in the wall of the house.\nThere lived many mice in the house. The woman in the house saw a mouse crawl  into the house in the moonlight. \"Look! In comes one,\" she said to the man in the house. The thief was so frightened that he hurriedly crawled out of the house and said to the one waiting outside, \"She found me when I was just in.\" But the thief outside didn't believe him, so he said, \"Let us try to crawl into the house together.\" At that time two mice happened to crawl into the house, too. The woman saw the mice and shouted, \"In come two, catch them!\" The two thieves were terribly frightened. The man in the house said, \"You saw them come in but where are they? I will catch them tonight.\" The two thieves started running away at once.\nThe two thieves wanted to make it clear whether they had been found or not the night before. The next day they acted as men selling sweet potatoes and came before the house. The man and the woman were ploughing in their fields. The rope broke and the woman came home for a rope. She saw two men selling sweet potatoes and wanted to buy some. She picked out two which looked like mice. At the time the man couldn't wait for her any longer in the fields and he ran back from the fields to hurry her up. The woman showed the sweet potatoes to the man and said, \"How they look like the two of last night.\" The man said, \"I asked you to fetch a rope, why don't you hurry for it?\" The two thieves ran away very quickly without their sweet potatoes."

      "The crowd cheered and cheered. The man with the horn waved and smiled his great smile. \"More! More!\" cried the crowd. And Louis Armstrong took his horn and began to play again. \n Here he was in England. Now a famous man, he was rich. He knew many important people. Wherever he went, people knew his name. They wanted to hear his music. As he played the sad, slow songs, Louis thought of his home in New Orleans. He lived there as a boy. It was a busy, exciting city. But Louis's family was very poor. He went to work to help his mother. He also went to school. One of Louis's teachers asked him to join the school band. \"This horn is yours until you leave our school,\" his teacher said. Louis's music was jazz and he loved it. He remembered all the music he heard. He didn't learn to read music until he was a man. \n When he left school, he played on many bands. He loved his work and people loved him. They knew that he had a wonderful talent. Louis played in little towns and in big cities. Armstrong's horn had as many sounds as ten horns--sometimes slow and sometimes sweet; sometimes fast and hot, high and low. His music was always strong and exciting. \"He does make wonderful music,\" said the man who listened happily. \"Yes,\" said another man, \"he makes that horn speak. \"\n The music ended and the crowd cheered. Louis Armstrong spoke with tears in his eyes, \"I think, my friends, you can listen to as much jazz as I can play. I thought jazz was my music; but now I understand it is ours. It is beautiful that music brings us together. \""

      "Active vacations are often the most relaxing of all. But Wait! It's all in defining what an active vacation is. We don't expect you to take up jogging, backpacking, or hang gliding. we ask the sedentary vacationers to spend two to four hours a day doing things, such as walking the city streets, exploring a nature preserve, or taking a leisurely rowboat ride.\nThese kinds of activities aren't just good for your physical health. They improve your mental health, even your spiritual health. And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile. Here are some fresh ideas for active and healthy vacation.\nMake the morning your activity time. At that time it is most likely that the weather will be friendlier, your energy level higher, and your schedule emptier than later in the day.\nHave a walk at dawn or dusk. Such activity is called rejuvenation . Try to make this a daily routine of life away from home, and you will guarantee yourself both physical and spiritual youth.\nGet into the water as much as you can. Don't allow yourself to spend your entire time sitting in front of the water. Whether it is the ocean, a swimming pool, or a tree-lined lake, make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking. Merely standing in waist-high water is a good workout, thanks to the action of the water. And you'll feel so much more alive!\nChoose a cruise for your trip. It's amazing how active you can be being stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic. Most cruise ships offer numerous options for seaworthy exercise. During your sea and land trips you can burn calories as you swim, hike, dive, and horseback ride.\nGet out of the car every two hours. Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road, either getting to and from our destinations, or using the car for sightseeing. But no matter how beautiful the scenery is, great and memorable vacations don't happen in a car seat. Don't wait for tiredness or nature's call to get you to pull over. Frequently get out and stretch, walk, picnic, shop, visit, and have fun. It's important for your health and energy, and it makes traveling a lot more active and interesting."

      "High Speed Book Scanner\nSimply turning pages of a book quickly may not seem like the best way to scan it. A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page. This high speed book scanner uses a camera that captures pages at 1000fps as they are turned. A system built in allows it to automatically correct any changes to the text due to the page bending as well as light differences due to shadows. \"It takes a shot of the shape, then it calculates the shape and uses those calculations to film the scanning,\" Ishikawa said, explaining the system used to reconstruct the original page.\nThe current system is able to scan an average 250-page book in a little over 60 seconds using basic computer hardware. While it now requires extra time to process the scanned images  , the researchers hope to eventually make the technology both faster and much smaller. \"In the more distant future, once it becomes possible to put all of this processing on one chip   and then put that in an iPad or iPod, one could scan just using that chip. At that point, it becomes possible to scan something quickly to save for later reading,\" Ishikawa said.\nBeing able to scan books with an iPhone may be further off, but Ishikawa says that a commercial version of the large-scale computer based scanning system could be available in two or three years. While the technology has the potential to take paper books into the digital age,\n."

      "The interview had been going on for about 20 minutes and everything seems to be going well. Then,suddenly,the interviewer asks an unexpected question,\"Which is more important,law or Dove?\"\nJob applicants in the West increasingly find themselves asked strange questions like this. And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China.\nEmployers want people skilled,enthusiastic and devoted. So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicants will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are. In response,employers are increasingly using questions which try and show the applicant's true personality.\nThe question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Keirsey Personality Sorter. It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems,rather than what they know. This is often called an aptitude test  .\nAccording to Mark Baldwin, many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult. When a Chinese person fills out an aptitude test, he or she will think there is a right answer and they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see.\nThis is sometimes called the prisoner's dilemma. Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest. But they fail because they don't understand what the interviewer is looking for. Remember that in an aptitude test,the correct answer is always the honest answer."

      "Cutting global warming pollution would not only make the planet healthier, it would make people healthier too, new research suggested.\nCutting carbon dioxide emissions could save millions of lives, mostly by reducing preventable deaths from heart and lung diseases, according to studies released Wednesday and published in a special issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.\n\"Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. \"As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases. This is not a small effect.\"\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease."

      "Does your local town have a nickname  ? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there?\nMany cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land.\nA project has been carried out to make a survey on how the nicknames of some places came about. The University of Winchester's Professor Bill Lucas is a patron   of the English Project. He explains that unofficial place names often show what people think about a place.\n\"The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,\" he says.\nBasingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area.\nSwindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump  . Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein.\nSome people say that the project may have a practical use. Glen Hart, the survey's head of research, says the information could be very helpful to the emergency services, for example. \"By having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly  _ the right place as soon as possible, for people usually remember the nicknames of some places instead of their official names. And this will take the helpers less time to reach the places.\" he says."

      "According to the dictionary definition of 'create',ordinary people are creative every day. To create means to bring into being,to cause to exist something each of us does daily. We are creative whenever we look at or think about something in a new way. \nFirst,this includes an awareness of our surroundings. It means using all of our senses to become aware of our world. This may be as simple as being aware of color1 and texture ,as well as taste, when we plan a meal. Above all,it is the ability to notice things that others might miss. \nA second part of creativity is an ability to see relationships among things. If we believe the expression,there is nothing new under the sun,the creativity is remaking or recombining the old in new ways. For example,we might do this by finding a more effective way to study or a better way to arrange our furniture,or we might make a new combination of camera lenses and filters to create an unusual photograph. \nA third part of creativity is the courage and drive to make use of our new ideas,to ask for them to achieve some new results. To think up a new idea is one thing;to put the idea to work is another. These three parts of creativity are included in all the great works of geniuses,but they are also included in many of our day to day activities."

      "It was near dusk, and Kim Cooper and her husband, Steve, were trucking through northern Kentucky transportation auto parts from Louisville to Detroit for a goods company. \"Steve, wake up!\" she shouted. \"There's a truck on fire!\"\nInside the burning truck, Ronnie Sanders, 38, was fighting for his life. He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact, but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van.\n\"I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch.\" At the bottom, rocks cut a fuel tank, which caught fire. A tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire.\nSteve dashed to Ronnie, who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had used his pocket knife to cut himself free from the driver's side seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to free him.\nHe tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150 gallon fuel tanks exploded.\nBoth Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts  on both of his legs. Steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns, and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke a tooth.\nIn February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver. Steve insists Ronnie is the real hero: \"If he hadn't gone into the ditch, he would have hit that van. It was his decision to drive off the road.\"\n\"I feel pretty good about it,\" says Ronnie. \"A lot of people could have been hurt.\""

      "Five-year-old Jocelyn Rojas spent all day playing happily with her friends outside her grandmother's apartment building. Her mom, Jaimee, kept her eye on the little girl from a window. At about 4 p.m., Jocelyn walked around the corner of the building to get her bicycle. However, half an hour later, she disappeared. Jaimee called 911.\nA short time later, police officers and firefighters crowded inthe area, blocking streets and searching the neighborhood. Officers handed out photos of the girl wearing thick-framed glasses.\nTemar Boggs, 15, a school athlete in track, was with some friends moving a couch into the apartment of his elderly neighbor when one officer approached him and asked if he'd seen Jocelyn. Unfortunately, none of them had seen her. A little bit later, Temar and his friends went to check out the situation. By 6:30 p.m., Jocelyn had been missing for more than two hours, and the search team was worried that the sun would set before she was found.\nJust at that moment, Temar felt an intense emotion that he was going to find her. He and his friend Chris Garcia, 13, rode alongside, simply keeping a sharp eye out as they circled around. Then Temar spotted a car circling around, as if the driver were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. Temar cycled close and made eye contact with the man behind the wheel, an older guy wearing a red-and-white striped shirt, and saw a tiny blond girl in the passenger seat. Temar instantly realized it must be the missing girl.\nThe boys cycled after the car, but the driver kept moving, winding his way through the neighborhood.\nFinally, the driver had to park the car ahead of them and pushed open the passenger-side door. A girl slipped out of the car. It was Jocelyn. Temar got off his bike, and carried her to the police. The kidnapper sped away.\nA police report later identified the man as a 63-ycar-old sex offender. He is still _ .\nNeil Harkins, chief of the Manheim Police Department, says \"The boys' heroics are 'something we don't normally hear about.' It is a very brave thing for young boys to do that.\" But when asked, Temar, now a tenth-grade student at Lucy Laney High School, says \"I didn't do it for attention. I just wanted to help.\""

      "In cities with rent control, the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord can charge for an apartment. Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartments. Their rent cannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits . Therefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent - controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who need apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city.\nSome theorists argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled, low - paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. They will replace workers with machinery. The price, which is the wage that employers must pay, increases. Therefore, other things being equal, the number of workers that employers want decreases. Thus, critics claim, an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment. Some poor people may find themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage."

      "Picking up objects plays an important role in people's life. El-E is a robot that is designed to get everyday objects for people with disabilities.\nAbout 1.5 meters tall, with a single robotic arm that can pick up objects at different heights, El-E is equipped to discover what its owner wants and then go and fetch it. The user can point a location to the robot using a \"point-and-click\" way of interaction, which provides a direct way to tell the robot which object to handle or where to go. The robot can adapt the position of its arm in order to grasp the object.\nAfter successful early trials, some scientists expanded El-E's functions and tried to combine voice commands with the laser   in order to do more complicated tasks, like opening doors. The robot recognizes words such as \"pull\" or \"push\" and performs the action on an object illuminated by the laser. In order to add more functions, project director Prof. Charlie and his colleagues are focusing on programming El-E to locate and fetch common household items such as a hairbrush, a bottle of pills or a cell phone.\nThe robot is also designed to learn from its mistakes. \"If it fails to fetch an object, it will recognize it and try again,\" Charlie said. Formal studies have shown El-E to be a good worker. In 127 out of 134 trials, the robot successfully picked up the requested object."

      "For a long time now, I've been fascinated by common phrases and their origins- and just why we say what we say. I decided to consult the experts, sort through all the research and compile   the answers. Here are a few of the standouts.\nQ: Why do we\"tie the knot  \"when we get married?\nA: Knots have been a common metaphor   in marriage ceremonies all over the world and through time. The expression means\"to unite in manage\".  In the Hindu marriage ceremony, the groom ties a ribbon around the bride's neck. In ancient Rome, the bride wore a belt that was tied in a knot. The groom would then unfasten it on their first night together as husband and wife.\nQ: Why do we say\"Many happy returns\"?\nA: The phrase is short for\"Many happy returns of the day\", which is to say,\"May this day return many times\"or\"May you have many more birthdays. \"\nQ: How about\"It's not over till the fat lady sings\"? Where does that come from?\nA: This expression is usually phrased as\"The opera isn't over till the fat lady sings. \"It got its start as a popular saying when it was used by a sportswriter Dan Cook in 1976 to indicate that a sporting contest wouldn't end until time was called.\nQ: What's the story of\"under the weather,\"especially when the weather's just fine?\nA: There's probably a nautical   explanation. In days gone by, when people felt seasick, they were told to go below-decks and find a spot in the middle of the ship where the motion would be less noticeable. In that way, they literally took themselves\"under the weather.\""

      "Father's Garden\nMy father was always a good  gardener. One of my earliest memories is standing without shoes in the freshly tilled  soil, my hands blackened from digging in the ground.\nAs a child, I loved following Dad around in the garden. I remember Dad pushing the tiller  ahead in perfectly straight lines. Dad loved growing all sorts of things: yellow and green onions, watermelons almost as big as me, rows of yellow corn, and our favorite--- red tomatoes.\nAs I grew into a teenager, I didn't get so excited about gardening with Dad. Instead of magical land of possibility, it had turned into some kind of prison. As Dad grew older, his love for gardening never disappeared. After all the kids were grown and had started families of their own, Dad turned to gardening like never before. Even when he was diagnosed with cancer, he still took care of his garden.\nBut then, the cancer, bit by bit, invaded his body. I had to do the things he used to do. What really convinced me that Dad was dying was the state of his garden that year. The rows and rows of multicolored vegetables were gone. Too tired to weed them, he simply let them be. He only planted tomatoes.\nFor the first few years after he died, I couldn't even bear to look at anyone's garden without having strong memories pour over me like cold water from a bucket. Three years ago, I decided to plant my own garden and started out with just a few tomatoes. That morning, after breaking up a fair amount of soil, something caught the corner of my eye and I had to smile. It was my eight-year-old son Nathan, happily playing in the freshly tilled soil."

      "Give it five minutes\nI used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I'd think of a way to disagree. I'd push back hard if something didn't fit my world-view.\nIt's like I had to be first with an opinion -- as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn't thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.\nThis came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn't have to do that.\nAnd what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole.\nHis response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\nThis was a big moment for me.\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He's given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it's better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you're right.\nThere's also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.\nLearning to think first rather than react quick is a life-long pursuit. It's tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn't. But I'm really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.\nIf you aren't sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs' reverence(respect) for ideas:\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\nThat's deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They're barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss.\nThere are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people's money and 2. Dismissing an idea.\nDismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn't involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That's easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.\nSo next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it's too hard or it's too much work.\nThose things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it."

Even though autumn is approaching Australia's Brisbane in April, one can still watch colorful blooming   flowers in Julie's little garden, as she tells that in her community,\"Each of us has a beautiful yard. The whole community, from children to elderly people, takes care of the environment as if they are taking care of their own garden.\"\n\"Gardening is the most popular club in our community,\" she says. \"A lot of retired people don't just regularly organize gardening lectures, but also personally visit families in the community to provide gardening training. So you can see that flowers continue to blossom  in our gardens throughout the year.\"\nTalking about her people's sense of caring for the environment, Julie says when people in the community take along their dog, they always carry a garbage bag to deal with the dog's waste. \"In our community, you will never experience the embarrassment of stepping on the dirty waste while you are walking on the grass,\" says Julie with a smile. \"Taking care of the dog's waste can also help to develop children's sense of responsibility!\"\nAs to protecting water resources, the Australian government has made strict rules for families. Julie says, \"We certainly would not use tap water to water the flowers!\" She says almost every family in her community has a huge tank used to store rainwater, which is later used as the resource of all outdoor water use, including car washing and watering the garden.

      "Friends play an important role in our lives, and although we can't be more familiar with the fact of friendship, we often don't clearly understand how we make friends, especially with Americans. Here are some pieces of advice on making friends with Americans:\n1. Visiting places Americans enjoy: parties, churches, restaurants, parks and sports clubs.\n2. Be willing to take the first step. Don't wait for them to get close to you. Americans in China may not know you speak English. They may be uncomfortable if they can't speak your language.\n3. Use small talks to open the conversation. Ask them where they're from, why they come to China, etc. . Remember: Be careful not to ask personal questions about age, salary and so on.\n4. Show an interest in their culture, their country or their job. Americans like to talk about themselves!\n5. Invite them to join you for dinner or just for coffee or tea. Try to set a specific time. Americans sometimes make general invitations like \"Let's go out for dinner sometime. \"Often this is just a way to be friendly. It is not always a real invitation.\n6. Don't expect too much at first. Maybe they're being friendly. But maybe they want to be your good friends. It will take time to tell."

Half the population of the country watched the final event and a new kind of TV program was born. Two years later in Holland , the first series of Big Brother was filmed. Again, it was a great success and the final program was watched by 15 million people. Now more than 20 countries around the world have Big Brother or Expedition Robinson on their TV screens. The ordinary people who take part in the programs are known by millions of people in their own countries and reality TV has become big, big business.\nFor the TV producers, reality TV is a dream come true because many of the programs cost nothing to make. At some point, the television viewers are asked to telephone the program to vote or to apply to take part in the show. It is the cost of these telephone calls that pays for the shows. One of the most popular shows is Pop Idol. In the show a group of attractive young people are made into pop stars. TV viewers vote for their favorite person on the show. The winner makes a record and millions of copies of the record are sold. His or her pictures are published on the covers of magazines or on the front pages of newspapers, and then, they are quickly forgotten.\nBut not everyone is happy about reality TV. In Portugal, two TV channels got into trouble because they showed too much of the personal lives of the people in the shows. In France, reality TV is called \"rubbish TV\" and the TV studios of Big Brother were attacked three times in one week. In Greece, Big Brother was described as \" against human rights and civilization\"."

It includes the best, the most beautiful and the most famous.\nSydney\nFor those who have made a flight from the other side of the world, if you come and don't see Sydney, it is a bit like going to Germany and not drinking a beer, or to England and not seeing London, or America and not trying a hot dog. There is plenty to see and do in Sydney apart from the well known attractions of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, and Bondi beaches.\nByron Bay\nLocated in New South Wales, just south of the Queensland border, Byron Bay is popular with not just international tourists, but is also a favorite holiday destination of Australians. The lighthouse is amazing at sunset (and it is the most easterly part of mainland Australia). There are a range of music festivals over the year that attract international and local musicians alike.\nThe Great Ocean Road\nThe Great Ocean Road, located in Victoria, is one of the best scenic drives of the world. Its official length is 243 kms (roughly 150 miles), but it will take you a full day to enjoy it due to the narrow and windy traffic lanes (only one in each direction).\nDaintree Rainforest\nLocated in northern Queensland, roughly 110 kms north of Cairns, the rainforest is a nature wonderland. It is Australia's largest rainforest, about 20% of Australia's native bird species can be found within the Daintree.\nThe Great Barrier Reef\nLocated in Queensland, this attraction is one of those attractions that are actually known by everyone. Extending for about 2,300 kms, it is home to many rare, endangered and unique animals and plant species."

The survey found that searching online is one of the leading ways that people look for a second opinion though doctors are still the main source of health information.\nForty-four percent of people are actually looking for doctors or other providers when they search for health information online. Another finding of the survey: Two-thirds of Internet users look online for information about a specific disease or medical condition.\nThe Internet has also become an important source of emotional support for people with health problems. Susannah Fox says one in five Internet users has gone online to find other people who have the same condition. It was more popular among people with more serious health issues--one in four people living with chronic diseases  . And it was basically _ with people living with rare disease. They are so eager to find other people online who share their health concerns.\nA disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than two hundred thousand people worldwide. The rise of social networking has made it easier for people with rare diseases to connect with each other and feel less alone.

      "We found out that Jenny was suffering hearing loss when she was four and a half years old. Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis .\nShe could not put pressure on the heels of her feet, so she walked on tiptoe , and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities , often associated with JRA.\nAll through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased. But, as soon as she could stand the pain, Jenny, immediately, carried on, as though she were pain-free.\nShe wore a smile on her face, a song on her lips, and a love and acceptance of others. That was simply amazing. She ran, when she could run. She played when she could play, and she danced when she could dance. And, when she could do none of these things, she took her medicine, and she waited until she could.\nJenny, a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes, was never a cheerleader. She never competed in a sport. She joined the band. She won a place in the Govemor's School for the Arts; yet, no one in the Charleston, South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny. The perimeters were, simply, not in place to deal with a student, who was both active and disabled. Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears, all through school. Her hearing improved to 60%, and she taught herself to read lips.\nAt school she was popular, attending every football game to cheer the team on. She carried her pillow everywhere she went, so that she could reduce the pain when she sat down. Then came her senior year in high school. She liked school activities, especially sports. So she began to bombard the school football coach. Finally the coach gave in, with the warning,\"If you miss ONE game, you're out!\"So, Jenny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team.\nShe carried big buckets of water to her teammates. She bandaged knees and ankles before every game. She gave inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history. When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games, one team member Jack explained, \"Well, when you've been knocked down, and you can't seem to move, you look up and see Jenny Lewis, walking across the field, dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow. It makes anything the rest of us may suffer seem pretty unimportant.\"\nAt the Senior Awards ceremony, Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston. Her favorite scholarship, however, was a small one from the Charleston Women's Club. The President of the Women's Club listed Jenny's achievements, starting with her grades, and ending with an excited,\"...and the first girl to letter in football, in Garrett High School history!\""

This past year has been one of the hardest for me. I felt I was stuck in a position that had nothing to do with what I wanted to do with my life. In January, after two years of being together, my boyfriend left me.\nI read your blog every morning as I drink my coffee at work, but it wasn't until this March that I told myself \"no more negativity\" as you taught readers in your blog.\nSince then I've got into new habits at work to keep my energy positive. When people walk in the front door, I'm the first face they see, so I smile big when I say \"good morning\" to them, especially on Mondays. Instead of waiting for someone to ask me for help, I offer it with an open mind. The CEO noticed my change and offered me the executive assistant position that I wanted.\nOne of the biggest things I've taken to heart from your blog is changing my opinions on my job. Yes, it was not an important position, but when I was passionate   about it, I could make my life fulfilling.\nAll in all, I have to thank you somehow for having the passion to help others because it truly is inspiring to me. So thank you so much, John. My life has changed because your words pointed me in the right direction, Take care!\nSincerely ,\nAmber"

      "Engineers should embrace  the arts, Sir John O'Reilly, a fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, argued in a lecture.\nAbout 59% of engineering companies in the IET's 2014 survey feared skill shortages could threaten  business.\n\"There is nothing as creative as engineering,\" Sir John told the reporter. He says science, technology, engineering and mathematics - often known as \"Stem\" subjects, are vital for a modern knowledge economy. But there is a massive shortfall in the number of recruits  - with a recent study by the Royal Academy of Engineering saying the UK needs to increase by as much as 50% the number of Stem graduates it produces.\nDelivering this year's Mountbatten Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John argued that engineers should recognise the role of the arts in their work - among other benefits; this could attract more people into the profession. The lecture, Full Steam Ahead for Growth, advocated a wider adoption  -- Steam, or science, technology, engineering, arts and maths. Engineers should embrace the arts as being key to creativity and an important component of innovation , crucial to creating new products and boosting future competitiveness, he argued. \"Engineering and technology is an increasingly diverse and creative field,\" said Sir John.\nSome university engineering departments already cooperated with art schools to develop understanding, he told the reporter. In particular he mentioned Cranfield University's Centre for Creative Competitive Design and Imperial College's work with the Royal College of Art. The two sets of people could work well together and more emphasis on the creative side of engineering could improve the success of products, he said.\n\"Aesthetics  is part of it,\" he told the reporter, adding that Apple's iPod was not the first digital media player, nor the only one that worked - but it came to dominate the market \"because it was nice to have\".\nSir John said he was not suggesting universities started requiring A-level art from engineering applicants - the key subjects for admission would continue to be maths and the sciences. But an emphasis on creative skills would help \"broaden the pool and attract more people in\"."

The robot must be able to recognize another car, to understand that it is moving and that it will interact with it as it gets closer.\"  Stanford's entrant  \"Junior\" is a changed 2006 Volkswagen Passat whose steering, throttle   and brakes all have been modified by engineers.\n   Lasers fitted on the car bumpers, radar and global positioning systems feed data into the on-board computer to determine its location and position. Thrun predicted that advances in artificial intelligence would lead to driverless cars on the roads by 2030. \n  \"Today they can drive about 100 miles, by 2010 I expect this to go 1,000 miles, by 2020 up to a million miles,\" he said. \"By 2030 you'll be able to see them on the highway, with driving reliability that will beat humans.\"\n   \"We believe this technology will affect all of us. It is going to have enormous significance for people who can't drive because of disabilities or because they are ill or impaired.\" Thrun said he believed robot-driven vehicles would be deployed in war zones before they were seen in everyday civilian environments."

In 1755, one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded was felt in Portugal. Around 2,000 people died. In 1923, a very strong earthquake hit Tokyo, the Yokohama area of Japan.

      "Collections were the inspiration  for a project at Thomas Tallis School, which formed part of the Imagine Children's Literature Festival last autumn. Each child (aged 12-13) beatified a box and wrote a story on the subject of collections to throw inside it. The boxes were spread within the Royal Festival Hall's Ballroom. Some were left empty to encourage\nThe subject chosen by Luren was an imaginative one. \"It's a sort o f Cinderella   story,\" she told me, inspired by a collection of letters from her cousin, ha the story these become love letters, burned by a creel stepmother. Lauren's best friend Charlotte is the stepmother. \"I'm in Charlotte's story too,\" says Lauren, \"and I get run over.\" Charlotte's tale was inspired by the girls' coin collection. \"We've collected foreign coins for years - since our families went on holiday to Tenerife.\" she explains. \"That was before the Euro, so we put pesetas in.\" Lauren continues: \"I fred a coin in the road, go to get it and get run over. I'm in hospital and then I die.\" Charlotte adds: \"Or she might not die. I haven't decided yet.\"\nMillie Murray, who is a tea-novel author, thinks that setting the subject of collections was a useful inspiration to their creativity rather than a restriction .  \"In the beginning I thought, 'Will the children be able to do it?'\" she says. \"But it's been fruitful. Some have their own collection, some have parents who do, and some have wlstten complete stories. It's made them think about something they wouldn't have otherwise, winch can only be a good thing.\""

      "In the past ten years, America's National Basketball Association (NBA) has grown increasingly dependent on the rest of the world to supply players.\nWhen Michael Jordan and Larry Bird won gold in Barcelona in 1992, the Americans were praised for teaching the world how to play basketball. This season, however, 20 percent of NBA rosters  will be filled by non-Americans. NBA commissioner David Stem happily embraces the trend. On a visit to Paris in October, Stern outlined his vision for the future, which is likely to see Europe hosting NBA games by 2010.\nThe NBA is now planning to _ .\n\"Our experience in China has been that it is going to be explosive in its growth,\"said Stem. The strategy (,)in China is television.\"We've made 14 deals in China with local and national networks on cable and satellite.\" The success of Chinese centre Yao Ming has paved the way for the NBA marketing blitz in China. The NBA, which is broadcasted in more than 200 countries in 42 languages, will put that to the test in October 2004 when the Houston Rockets play two pre-season games against the Sacramento Kings in Beijing and Shanghai. The NBA knows that it needs a global market to condensate for tough times on _ soil.\n\"It doesn't matter where the players come from, all the NBA teams now know that they have to scout(,) internationally,\" said Terry Lyons, the NBA's vice-president of international public relations. \"It has increased the level of competition here.\" As Frenchman Tony Parker and Argentine Emanuel Ginobili showed in winning championship rings with the San Antonio Spurs last season, many people can earn the respect of their American peers. Others, such as the Houston Rockets' Chinese centre Yao Ming -- number one draft pick in 2002 -- and the Detroit Pistons' 18-year-old Serb Darko Milicic -- number two overall in this year's draft -- are icons in-waiting. It is the ultimate(,) revolution -- the rest of the world teaching the US how to play basketball."

      "We live in a dangerous world. The figures for crime go up year by year. If you were attacked in the street, would you be able to defend yourself? Not very well probably, especially if someone was pointing a gun at you. We all see a lot of violence of films, but recently some programs on television showed how people can defend themselves without guns. For example, in one film a woman was attacked from behind. She threw the man, who was heavier and stronger than she was, over her head. Then she held him tightly on the ground. How? She knew Judo.\nJiu-jitsu, as judo is sometimes called, means \"muscle science\" in Japanese. The student of judo needs to learn a lot about the body, its bones and muscles. Judo uses a number of \"falls\", \"holds\" and \"throws\". Someone who does not know judo cannot defend himself against them. If you know judo you can defend yourself against a person who is stronger than you. You had better not practice judo on your friends unless they can fall without hurting themselves! Being strong is one thing, but using the body wisely is another. In judo, you use the other person's body to help you. You \"throw\" him to the ground and \"hold\" him there, so that he cannot move. Of course, it takes time and practice, but knowing judo is useful. In a violent world you ought to be able to defend yourself."

      "People appear to be born to calculate. The numerical skills of children develop so early that it is easy to imagine an internal clock of mathematical maturity guiding their growth. Not long after learning to walk and talk, they can set the table with impressive accuracy--one plate, one knife, one spoon, one fork for each of the five chairs. Soon they are capable of noting that they have placed five knives, spoons and forks on the table, and a bit later, that this amounts to fifteen pieces of silverware. Having thus mastered addition, some people expect that if a child were on a desert island at birth and brought back seven years later, he or she could enter a second-grade mathematics class without any serious problems of intellectual adjustment.  \nOf course, the truth is not so simple. This century, the work of psychologists has cast light on the unnoticeable forms of daily learning on which intellectual progress depends. Children were observed as they slowly grasped--or, as the case might be, came across--concepts that adults take for granted, as they refused, for instance, to admit that quantity is unchanged as water pours from a short thick glass into a tall thin one. Psychologists have since proved that young children, asked to count the pencils in a pile, readily report the number of blue or red pencils, but must be persuaded into finding the total. Such studies have suggested that the most basic parts of mathematics are mastered gradually, and with effort. They have also suggested that the very concept of abstract numbers--the idea of a oneness, a twoness, a threeness that applies to any class of object and is a prerequisite   for doing anything more mathematically demanding than setting a table--is itself far from natural born."

      "This Monday,the nation will start to celebrate Presidents' Day,just seven days before George Washington's birthday.Everyone agrees that day is a holiday,but is it just to celebrate George Washington's Birthday? What about Abraham Lincoln? Some government offices call it Presidents' Day.Others say the holiday is officially Washington's Birthday.Confused yet?\nGeorge Washington was elected the country's first President on April 30,1789.Soon after,Americans began publicly celebrating his birthday.Presidential historians say the actual date of George Washington's birth is February 11,1732.But a change in the calendar system 20 years later shifted all dates,making Washington's birthday February 22,which is now well accepted.In 1879.Congress made Washington's birthday an official federal holiday.It was the first federal holiday to celebrate an individual's birthday.In 1968,Congress passed the Monday Holidays Act,which moved the holiday to the third Monday in February.The new law did not change the holiday's name.It was still called Washington's Birthday,even though some lawmakers wanted to call it Presidents' Day to include Abraham Lincoln,whose actual birthday is February 12.\nMany people argue that the holiday should celebrate all past Presidents.They feel Lincoln should be honored for his role in preserving the nation during the Civil War and helping to free slaves.Others feel the holiday should only honor Washington.the country's first President.They say shifting the focus away from Washington would mean future generations of kids would not know about the Father of Our Country.\nLaws have been introduced in Congress over the years to require use of the term \"George Washington's Birthday.\"but none of those laws have been passed.Meanwhile,many state governments and school districts now use the term \"Presidents' Day.\"Many stoles also use it to promote holiday sales.\nShould the holiday honor Washington,Washington and Lincoln,or all past Presidents?

      "(Reuters)The Thunderbird is one of the most readily recognized creatures of American Indian mythology.While the vast majority of biologists believe the Thunderbird myth to be nothing more than a spiritual symbol, some zoologists believe that the hard may actually exist.   \nI still vividly recall seeing an impossibly large raptor when I was five years old, which a few people have said might be the Thunderbird.Standing in my grandmother's back yard in Alabama, I recall watching an enormous black bird with a swallow - like tail flying directly over me from an oak tree. Its wingspan seemed to be at least three times my height, which would have made it at least fourteen feet across.\nWhile the early childhood memory is often unreliable, I clearly remember the details of the  \"Thunderbird\".To this very day, I sometimes stand on my grandmother' s yard, eyeballing the old oak tree, but I have not yet seen another bird that resembles the giant bird.I have seen eagles, and hawks - but never another Thunderbird.\nOther modern sightings of what may have been thunderbirds have also occurred.In 1977, three boys were playing in a neighborhood in Illinois.They reported that two large birds chased after  them.One of the boys was attacked and suffered somewhat serious injuries, He was carried a few  feet off the ground, before the bird dropped him and disappeared into the wilderness.\nSeveral people interviewed the boys and their story remained the same, even under the pressure.the description of the birds somewhat matched the Andean condor ; however, these  massive condors have never been known to exist in the United States.\nAnother sighting came in 2002, in Alaska, when many people reported seeing a bird with a fourteen - foot wingspan.After being investigated, it was finally concluded that the bird was most likely a particularly large sea eagle, which typically has a wingspan of six to eight fickle.\nI will probably never know what the strange -looking giant bird from the oak tree was, and biologists will probably never be able to fully confirm the identity of the giant raptors spotted in Illinois and Alaska.If the Thunderbird does indeed exist, it will probably continue to remain mysterious."

      "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it."

      "Hi, everybody. On Friday, I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives--challenges shared by many of you.\nThanks to the work we've all put in, our economy has come a long way these past six years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in six years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past six months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003.\nBut the gains of a growing economy aren't yet felt by everyone. So we've got to harness  this momentum , and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead.\nIn recent weeks, I've talked about these choices, from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing. Today, I want to focus on what I discussed with those women -- the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today's economy.\nRight now, women make up almost half of our workers. More women are their family's main _ than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing policies that benefit women--because that benefits all of us.\nWomen deserve fair pay. Even though it's 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. We don't have second-class citizens in this country--we shouldn't in the workplace, either. So let's make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, and have a fair shot at success.\nWomen deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby, an ailing parent, or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship. So let's make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave .\nPregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly. Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That's wrong--and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect.\nNew parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There's nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you're at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many states, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let's start demanding Pre-K for our kids.\nAnd when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn't passed a minimum wage increase in seven years, it's long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. And more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit, too. So let's do this -- let's give America a raise.\nAll of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We've just got to speak up and choose them. Because they'll build a stronger America for all of us.\nThanks, and have a great weekend."

      "Now some women are spending a weekend at Mother's Camp . There, husbands and children are not allowed. Why would a woman want to take a vacation without her family? Some women say they need time to be alone.\nAt Mother's Camp a woman has room to herself. She can sleep, read or watch TV, and no one will bother her. No children will ask,\"Mom, what's for dinner?\" No husband will say, \"Oh, dear, I can't find any clean socks.\"In fact almost 50% of women in the United States work outside the home. Many of them work full-time and then come home to a second job-taking care of their homes and families. These working women say one of their biggest problems is housework.\nIn the United States, working wives do about 75% of the housework. Many of their husbands say they want to help. But then they burn the rice or they can't find the pans. They ask so many questions that their wives decide it is easier to do the job themselves.\nSome women go to Mother's Camp just to get a break from housework. For two days they don't cook, they don't clean, they don't look after their children and husbands. What do they do? They enjoy warm, sunny weather, walking, swimming or boating in a clear blue lake and sing songs around the campfire. They relax away from home.

      "The percentage of districts that require elementary schools to teach physical education increased, to 93% last year from 83% in 2000. \n    But just 4% of elementary schools, 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools provided physical education each school day, as is recommended by the disease control agency. One-fifth of schools did not require physical education at all.\n    In 2004, Congress passed a law requiring each school district to develop a \"wellness policy\" to promote the students' health by setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity. Those policies are just now taking effect, and some school administrators predict that the next survey will show more marked improvements. Some schools have set out to place health education on the same requirement with academics. In Los Angeles County, Sepulveda Middle School has banned soft drinks and eliminated unhealthy snacks from the school store. Salad, fruit and yogurt are always available in the cafeteria, said Patricia J. Pelletier, the principal. \n    Nearly an hour of physical education is required daily, the school offers after-hours training in distance running, and it has started a class on healthy cooking for parents. \n    \"If kids are healthy and have healthy lifestyles, they're going to be better students,\" Ms Pelletier said. \"They're going to be in school, and they're going to be connected with the teachers in a better way.\"\n    The survey found that nearly two-thirds of schools prohibited tobacco use at all places, including at off-campus functions, up from 46% in 2000. Another finding was that the proportion of states that require middle schools to teach human sexuality grew, to 59% from 46%. \n    The report found a variety of indications of healthier cooking in school cafeterias. 55% reported that they had removed the skin from poultry before cooking, up from 40%, and 46% now use low-fat cheeses, up from 31%. But 12% of elementary schools, 19% of middle schools and 24% of high schools offer students brand-name fast food from businesses like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell."

All she asked was \"Do you still want one of the kittens? There's one here with no eyes and no one can take him.\" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten.\nWhen we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around, sniffing everything. He went through a time when he could climb the stairs, but couldn't get down. He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him. Every now and then when he gets disoriented he'll stop and cry. But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn't long before he finds his way back to us.\nAlso, a few weeks after getting Jack, we got a new barn cat named Bear. I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise. He loves to run (at top speed!) around the backyard and gardens. Bear and Jack have become best friends. Jack always knows when Bear is around. He'll run across the yard straight to Bear and wrap his front legs around his neck in a big hug. When they're tired they'll lie down in the grass together.\nJack is truly an inspiration. I've owned a lot of kittens in my life, but Jack is the happiest, most playful of them all. People who know Jack don't feel sorry for him. They cherish him for the treasure that he is. I have talked to a few people who haven't met him personally and tend to pity him, but they just don't understand. Jack doesn't need pity. I think that cats like him don't have disabilities; they have adaptabilities."

      "Although most weddings follow long-held traditions, there's still room for American individualism. For example, the usual place for a wedding is in a church. But some people get married outdoors in a scenic spot. A few even have the ceremony while skydiving or riding on horseback! The couple may invite hundreds of people or just a few close friends. They choose their own style of colors, decorations and music during the ceremony. But some things rarely change. The bride usually wears a beautiful long white wedding dress. She traditionally wears \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\" The groom wears a formal suit.\nSeveral close friends participate in the ceremony as attendants, including the best man and the maid of honor.\nAs the ceremony begins, the groom and his attendants stand with the minister, facing the audience. Music signals the entrance of the bride's attendants, followed by the beautiful bride. Nervously, the young couple repeats their vows  . Traditionally, they promise to love each other \"for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.\" But sometimes the couple has composed  their own vows. They give each other a gold ring to symbolize their marriage commitment. Finally the minister announces the big moment, \" I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride!\"\nAt the wedding reception, the bride and groom greet their guests. Then they cut the wedding cake and feed each other a bite. Guests talk with each other while enjoying the cake, drinks and other treats. When the reception is over, the newlyweds run to their \"decorated\" car and speed off. Many couples take a honeymoon, a one- to two-week vacation trip, to celebrate their new marriage."

      "Bernie was smart and wanted to be his own boss.When Bernie was 25 he took a wife. Bernie had saved some money and decided on a dry goods and grocery store combined.\n              Marie had a knack for arranging the merchandise to appeal to customers and Bernie didn't mind the long hours. He was happy, and life was good.The business thrived until the great depression hit the entire country. No one had money to purchase pretty things or even food. In 1930, Marie had a heart attack and left Bernie alone. \n              Following Marie's death, which Bernie felt was brought about from worrying about the store, He lost interest in everything. He had few customers and did not make them feel welcome, Bernie wandered about the store , dusting a bit and sweeping the floor. His inventory remained almost the same, as nothing much was sold .A deep depressing set in. He had lost Marie , his true love , and now his business seemed lost as well, Why did he want to live ?\n              A few houses down the street lived a family who had also fallen on hard times. They seldom had three meals a day. Julie , the youngest girl, was fourteen . Julie worried about Mr. Mears' getting so thin. At meal time, she would take a portion of their meal to Bernie. She would stay and talk to him, dusting and cleaning . \n              After several months Bernie began to improve. He still had no customers to speak of, but from what he had left in the stor , he would sack a few cans to take to Julie's family. \n              In early spring, Julie saw her father planting a garden. This gave her an idea. She suggested Bernie making a garden in the big space beside the store, which they had once thought would become a parking lot , and sell the produce really cheap in the store. It would help the neighbors and also Bernie to have money for new merchandise. They would plant half the garden space now and half in three weeks giving them fresh produce for a long time . \n              Julie prayed hard as they placed the seeds in the ground. When the seeds sprouted, Julie looked anxiously at the rows and there were no empty spots. They all came up and produced the best crop of vegetables Bernie had ever seen. They soon became well-known in the community for having the best prices and finest produce in town . They also extended credit to their neighbors and accepted various items as trade for merchandise.\n              The two of them worked hard throughout the 1930s and made a very successful business. Julie earned a salary . As the economy picked up, so did sales at the store."

      "During the tsunami   disaster of 2004, over 300,000 people died. No one has counted the number of animals killed, but we know that it wasn't many. All over the region, before the disaster struck, animals were behaving strangely.\nShortly before the tsunami, in Khaolak, Thailand, twelve elephants that were giving tourists rides became agitated. They suddenly left their usual habitat, carrying four surprised Japanese tourists to safety. On the eastern coast of India, flamingos  , which should be breeding at this time of year, suddenly flew to higher ground. Of the two thousand wild pigs that live in an Indian nature reserve, only one was found dead after the tsunami.\nThe idea that the animals are able to predict disasters is nothing new. In fact, it has been well-recorded over the years. Twelve hours before Hurricane Charlie hit Florida in 2004, fourteen sharks left their natural habitat and stayed in deep waters for two weeks. The sharks, which were being observed by US scientists, had never done this before. They escaped the hurricane. In the winter of 1975 in Haicheng, China, snakes which would normally have been hibernating   were seen on the ground. Days later there was a big earthquake striking.\nUnlike human beings, wild animals' senses are sharper and they can feel even the smallest changes in the environment. In other words, they see natural warnings that are invisible to the human eye. Ancient people probably had the similar \"senses\", which they needed to survive, but these have been lost to us as modern technology leads us further away from the danger that nature creates.\nThe real question is, can we use the reactions of animals to save ourselves from natural disasters? Animal behaviour expert, Rupesh Kaneira, believes we have no choice. \"The technology which we rely on isn't always perfect, and in poorer countries it isn't even available. Animals know the environment better than any of us. When they run for their lives, we must follow.\""

      "New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that people who struggle with mood problems or addiction can safely quit smoking and that kicking the habit is associated with improved mental health. \n     Cavazos-Rehg, an assistant professor of psychiatry, found that quitting or significantly cutting back on cigarette smoking was linked to improved mental health outcomes. Quitting altogether or reducing by half the number of cigarettes smoked daily was associated with lower risk for mood disorders like depression, as well as a lower likelihood of alcohol and drug problems.\n     \"We don't know if their mental health improves first and then they are more motivated to quit smoking or if quitting smoking leads to an improvement in mental health,\" Cavazos-Rehg said. \"But either way, our findings show a strong link between quitting and a better psychiatric outlook.\"\n     In addition, she believes the serious health risks associated with smoking make it important for doctors to work with their patients to quit, regardless of other psychiatric problems.\n     \"About half of all smokers die from related to smoking, so we need to remember that as complicated as it can be to treat mental health issues, smoking cigarettes also causes very serious illnesses that can lead to death,\" she explained.\n     Cavazos-Rehg and her team analyzed questionnaires gathered as part of the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions. In the early 2000s, just under 35,000 people were surveyed. As part of the study, they answered questions about drinking, smoking and mental health in two interviews conducted three years apart.\n    The researchers focused on data from 4,800 daily smokers. Those who had addiction or other psychiatric problems at the time of the first survey were less likely to have those same problems three years later if they had quit smoking. And those who hadn't had psychiatric problems at the initial survey were less likely to develop those problems later if they already had quit. \n   \"We really need to spread the word and encourage doctors and patients to tackle these problems,\" Cavazos-Rehg said. \"When a patient is ready to focus on other mental health issues, it may be an ideal time to address smoking cessation, too.\""

      "Most people think about donating blood. However, very few actually do it. Even the most consistent ones donate an average of just three to four times during their lifetime. Now the officials in Sweden are trying to change the trend with the help of modern-day technology.\nThe encouragement to donate again begins shortly after the donor leaves the clinic when he/she receives a \"thank you\" text. Though that certainly helps them feel appreciated, what is even more pleasing is the text they receive each time their blood is used to help someone in need.\nKarolina Wiberg, manager of the Stockholm blood service, believes this small gesture not only results in repeat donors, but helps bring in new ones. _ that was started in Stockholm has received such positive feedback that it is now being rolled out across the country.\nHowever, Swedish officials are not stopping there. They are also encouraging local clinics to publish the exact levels of the different blood groups they have at any given time on their websites. This allows potential donors to realize that their blood can make a difference in saving someone's life.\nWhile all these outreach( ) programs are great, busy citizens, even the ones with the best intentions have to be occasionally reminded. In order to jog their memories, officials ask people for authorization  to send them text, Facebook, and e-mail reminders. Though that may sound disturbing, the citizens do not seem to mind, given that the messages are light-hearted and fun -- things like \"We won't give up until you bleed.\"\nThough Sweden is currently the only country using modern technology to urge more donations, don't be surprised if more join in, especially if the Nordic country's blood banks start to overflow!"

There are plenty of things I wish I could do differently. I wanted to be a doctor. But that's not going to work out. So I'll be a lawyer  instead. I also wanted to dance and play soccer. My parents taught me that I'm like this for a reason -- to educate people and show them that this disease affects  my bones -- not my brain. My friends Erica once said to me, \"Kennedy, you're not disabled. You just can't walk.\""

      "The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. Her shopping had tired her and the basket had grown heavier with every step of the way home. In the lift her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest, but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must tell her daily maid the next morning to lock the door, and then she remembered that she had gone shopping after the maid had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks. She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the living room she saw a sight of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced into the house during her absence. Her first thought was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more reasonable to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the doorman from his basement .By this time her legs were beginning to shake, so she sat down and accepted a cup of a very strong tea, while she telephoned to the police. Then her sense regained, she was ready to set off with the doorman's help to search for any thieves who might still be hiding in her flat."

      "Dreaming is a natural part of who we are. We explore our dreams and develop personal dreams. We even like to dream BIG!\nFor the most part our dreams and wishes focus on the end result. We see ourselves in love, married, driving a great car, on vacation, with tons of money, in a great career, etc. Dreaming about the end result is just fantasizing and wishing. Wishing relies on some magical force to make our dreams turn into reality, and we become unhappy as we're not living  our dreams.\nSo how can we make our dreams come true? That is a question we all often struggle with. Even though we struggle with the answer, the answer is not that clear. We make our dreams come true with the action we take.\nIn my opinion, if you dream about being in good health, then change your dream to see yourself working out and eating right day by day. See the beginning of the dream and let the dream build day by day with all the action that gets you to the end dream of you being in good health.\nIf you want riches, then change the dream. Dream of yourself going to school, developing a career, working hard and taking the steps to arrive at the destination. If you want love, love the process. Love the dating process . Love yourself and the journey to find love.\nMake all your dreams include the beginning, middle and end. Then when you are doing the action instead of thinking to yourself, \"This is a drag. I don't like working out,\" or if you are having any negative thoughts about doing the work it takes to create your visions , realize then that every step of the way you are living your dream. You are living your dream because you made the action and journey part of your dream."

      "Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadiaspokeswoman, said."

      "It was a physical class.

I'm Wang Yaping. I'll host your lecture today.\" Smiling to the camera, Wang, China's second female astronaut, started her video class on June 20 on board the Tiangong-1 space station.\nTo show how Newton's Laws work in space, Wang and her fellow astronauts used simple items like balls and spinning tops. The highlight of the lecture was when Wang _ using a metal ring, something that only happens in zero gravity, where the surface tension  of water is much higher than it is on the earth. She then took it a step further by pouring more water onto the film and turning it into a water ball, leaving the audience amazed by what they saw.\nThe 40-minute lesson seemed to have passed too quickly for students to see enough of those magical experiments. But sending stuff into space is really expensive. According to The Beijing Times, every kilogram launched into space cost 20,000 dollars. The experimental items taken this time were all strictly selected and weighed about 2.9 kilograms in total. This adds up to quite a large price tag.\nThe organizers of the event also had to consider the time of day: the communication signal between the earth and Tiangong-1 was best during that specific 40 minutes, when the spacecraft was flying within the coverage of all of the ground-based testing stations."

My first words when I came to myself were, \"Hello, Marcus. \"Even though I had no memory of my own name, or that the woman crying at my bedside was my mother, I knew Marcus immediately; it was like a genetic memory. just felt close to him.\nAs weeks went by, I still could remember nothing before the accident. Marcus was the only person I could relate to.\nI had to relearn everything, and Marcus helped me. Because of my twin I wasn't scared of having lost my memory; I believed everything he said. He became my memory, telling me about my school, friends, previous girlfriends and holidays, showing me family photographs, and telling me how perfect I was.\nWith his encouragement I slowly recovered and tried to become the person everyone around me loved. Then years later, when my memories flooded back, I learned that I was anything but perfect--I was troublesome, selfish, and now very angry with Marcus for having lied to me.\nBut finally I understood. Out of love, Marcus had chosen not to tell me about my dark side. He wanted me to have a fresh start--and in fact I had one. Thanks to him, I was able to get married and have kids.

      "Beijing (Xinhua) -- In 2010, some 108,000 people returned to the Chinese mainland from abroad, a number that had risen 56.2 percent from the previous year, according to statistics recently published by the Ministry of Education.\n       \"For Chinese employers, a 70 percent willingness to hire overseas workers, although that is still lower than the average rate of 76 percent for Asia, is quite a high figure when compared with the past,\" said Emma, regional director of Hays in Hong Kong and the mainland, who was in charge of the survey .\n       Company executives , she said, have recently come to prefer hiring Chinese natives who have returned home after studying or working elsewhere.Expatriates  have fallen to a second choice, she said.\n       In the past, expatriates and returned Chinese have earned three to four times as much money as Chinese residents who do not have overseas experience.Expatriates would often rise to the senior positions within an company, while returned Chinese could find positions as mid-level executives with   ease.\n       But all overseas job candidates, especially those who lack practical experience, are gradually losing their advantages among a trend of pay increases in China.\n       In 2010, the country recorded the greatest rise in wages in Asia.Of all Chinese employees surveyed that year, 68 percent said they had received a raise worth 3 percent to 10 percent of their salaries, according to the survey.\n       Moreover, 51 percent of the Chinese surveyed were expecting to get raises of 6 to 10 percent in 2011, and 33 percent thought their income increase will go beyond 10 percent.\n       \"Now it's common in many companies to see overseas candidates earning the same salaries as their Chinese coworkers,\" said Emma.\"Even some experienced expatriates, on average, earn only 20 percent more than their Chinese peers.\"\n       Emma said overseas workers with little work experience no longer enjoy a great advantage over graduates of Chinese universities.But those with two to three years of work experience are still \"red-hot\".\n       There are now about 45 million native Chinese living outside the country, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council said on Jun 16, 2010."

      "Americans often say that there are only two things a person can be sure of:death and taxes.Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world.\nTaxes are the money that people pay to support their government.There are generally three levels of government in the United States:federal,state,and city;therefore,there are three types of taxes.\nSalaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part.It depends on their salaries.The federal government has a two-level income tax:that is,15 or 28 percent.$17 850 is the cut off.The tax rate is 15 percent below $17 850 and 28 percent above.\nThe second tax is for the state government:New York,California,or any of the other forty-eight states.Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government.Of course,the percentage for the state tax is lower.Other states have a sales tax,which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state.Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues(=annual income).\nThe third tax is for the city.This tax comes in two forms:property tax(people who own a home have to pay taxes on it) and excise tax ,which is collected on vehicles in a city.The cities use this money for education,police,public works,etc.\nSince Americans pay such high taxes,they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes.People always complain about taxes.They often say that the government misuses their tax dollars.They all believe that taxes are too high in this country."

      "The atmosphere and oceans are not the only parts of the environment being damaged. Rain forests are being quickly destroyed as well, and their survival is questionable. E.O. Wilson, a biologist at Harvard, called the depletion   of rain forest areas \"the greatest extinction since the end of the age of dinosaurs\".\nUnlike some environmental issues, rain forest depletion has fortunately received significant public and media attention. Despite the opposition to the cutting down of rain forests, the problem continues. Every year, Brazil chops down an area of forest the size of the state of Nebraska. In addition to the Amazon's rain forests, many other forests are being cut down as well. In Indonesia, Zaire, Papua-new Geinea, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Venezuela, rain forests that were once great have been lost.\nAccording to some estimates, 50 million acres of rain forests are cut down every year. The United Nations says the figure is closer to 17 million acres. The World Wildlife Fund says every minute, 25 to 50 acres are cut or burned to the ground.\nThe world's growing population has been a primary reason of rain forest destruction. More people need land to live on and wood products to consume. Limiting population growth may be the first in a series of steps that would limit the destruction of the rain forests."

      "In today's throw away society, dealing with the city's growing mountain of waste is an inereasing challenge for the city countil . \nRecently. Edinburgh is faced with the problem of dssposing of about250,000\nMillion tons of waster a year . Despite different ways to dispose of much of it in a green manner---largely through encouraging tecycling---its aging facilities such as the Powderhall landfill do not have the ability to deal with it.\nThe European Union(EU) has issued a new policy, regulating how such mountains of waster are to hr disposed of. The five councils (Edinburgh. East Lothian. West Lothian. Midlethian and Borders) face fine around $18million a year from 2013 it they don't inerease recycling levels and rely less on landfill. With this in mind, the coumlls got together with the idea of building a lage incinerator plant  to burn half of the waste produced in their districts. But the plan fell apart after the change of target levels by a new UK government waste policy which required that no more than 25% of the city's waste should be disposed of in this way by 2025.\nAfter the plan was abandoned, a private company which already transported millions of tons of the city's wast by train to a landfill site near Dunbar, offered an alternative soution when it suggested opening a huge waste site near Portobello.\nSince Powderhall is supposed to close in 2015, it seemed necessary for the members of the Edinburgh Council to accept the suggestion. But soon they turned it down--after 700 local objections reached them--because it would have meant hundreds of lorries a day making loud noise through heavily populated areas.\nThat still leaves eth council with a problem. By 2013,only50%of 1995 levels of waste will benllewed to be sent to landfill. Even if recveling large are met, there will still be a large amount of rubbish to be burnt up. Due build an Edinburgh and Midlothian councils have now decided to work together to build an ineinerator plant as time to find a solution is fast running out."

      "Do you want to be a successful person? Would you like to know how successful people usually think and what drives them? Here I am going to tell you the key to success that successful people share.\nFirst of all, successful people never blame someone or something outside of themselves for their failure to move ahead. They realize that their future lies in their own hands. They understand that they can't control things in life, such as nature, the past and other people. At the same time, they are well aware that they can control their own thoughts and actions. They take responsibility for their life.\nPerhaps what most separates successful people from others is that they live life \"on purpose\" --- they are doing what they believe they are put here to do. In their opinion, having a purpose in their life is the most important element that enables them to deal with things around them. They hold the view that when they live their life \"on purpose\", their main concern is to do the job right. They live what they do. People want to do business with them because of their commitment. To live their life \"on purpose\", successful people find a cause they believe in and create a business around it.\nBesides, they never give up easily. Once they have set up goals in their life, they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. To achievers always bear in mind what they don't have forever. Rather than see this as negative or depressing, they would use the knowledge to _ themselves on and go after what they want energetically and passionately.\nSo keep in mind what successful people always hold to be true so that you will have a clear idea of what you should do to be successful in life."

      "Science Fiction\nThe science fiction type of entertainment is considered by most to be fathered by Jules Verne (A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) and H. G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands.\nWhat helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story. For example, the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the Star Trek television program and movie series. Advances in genetics  cause fantasies of the end of disease, horrors of eugenics , and thrillers where creatures disappearing long ago are brought back to life. The science fiction author's self-determined role is that of field glasses for humanity--searching the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling."

      "I love everything about making Easter dinner except the Saturday shopping. That day, the supermarket can be as crowded as a department store at Christmas. And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me. I lifted it out. It was a box of pastry dough -- the final ingredient I needed for my recipe."

But, it could be _ Sometimes the rainy season can come a month earlier or later. It can be prolonged even more than 4 months and so can the dry season. Even during the dry season, rain can occur several times in certain areas.\nThe prolonged dry season in tropical areas usually causes a lot of losses. It will be very harmful to local farmers, because most of the tropical areas sre regions of the developing countries. Sometimes agricultural and plantation crops will be damaged because of so much dry land and the fact that the river used to flow the water for rice fields are also dry. Rain is very important for plants because rain contains many nutrients that plants are in great need of.\nWhat's more, if the prolonged rainy season arrives and then floods usually occur in certain areas of low lands. Even for the capital city of Jakarta floods have struck several times during the prolonged rainy season. In addition to floods, the rainy season can cause many diseases. During the dry season, diseases are usually caused by mosquitoes such as dengue fever. While in the rainy season, people who have the weak immune will be more easily attacked by some diseases such as flu, fever, diarrhea, and much more.\nIf you live in the other places and want to travel to the tropical regions, make sure that you have known much about the season and the effect for these months in which you want to travel as tourists.

      "Experts have put forward detailed plans for a tunnel to connect Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.\n    The shortest proposed route would be 126 kilometers more than twice the length of the English Channel Tunnel. And the longest proposed route would be 207 kilometers.\n    A recent conference in Xiamen, Fujian Province brought together more than 70 experts. The event was co-sponsored   by universities from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.\n    Fujian is the province where both proposed routes would begin. There is direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air and sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later, although there is a lack of government funding . There are no technical problems to build a Taiwan tunnel. But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits .\n    A professor of Tsinghua University said, \"A special feature of huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the period of construction.\"\n    For example, he said, the English Channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries. And preparations for the huge Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River began in the 1950s.\n    The Xiamen conference focused on the longest southern route, which would pass Jinmen and Penghu.\n    The first stage of the new project could be a bridge to cross the five kilometers between Xiamen and Jinmen. This would mean that travelling from Xiamen to Jinmen by car would only take five minutes.\n    The longest tunnel now being planned anywhere in the world is the 54-kilometer land tunnel to link Lyon in France with Turin in Italy. The tunnel will not be completed until 2015-2020."

      "Trees are useful to man in three very important ways: they provide him with wood and other products, they give him shade, and they help to prevent drought and floods.\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the world man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important. In his eagerness to draw quick profit from the trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had.\nTwo thousand years ago a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire. It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.\nEven though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal  or selling wood to the townsman . He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.\nThis does not only mean that the villager's sons and grandsons have fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up--allowing the rain to sink in and also hold the soil, thus preventing it being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well. When all the topsoil is gone, nothing remains but a worthless desert."

      "History is full of cases where dreams have been a pathway to creativity and discovery. A striking example is provided by Dr. Otto Loewi, a pharmacologist and winner of a Nobel Prize. Loewi had spent years studying the chemical transmission  of nerve impulses  . A major breakthrough in his research came when he dreamed of an experiment three nights in a row. On the first two nights he woke up and wrote down the experiment quickly and untidily on paper. But the next morning, he couldn't tell what the notes meant. On the third night, he got up after having the dream. This time, instead of making notes he went straight to his laboratory and performed the important experiment. Loewi later said that if the experiment had occurred to him while awake he would not have given it another thought.\nLoewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions. Nervous feelings are reduced during dreaming, which may be especially useful in solving problems that require a fresh point of view.\n Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping. Before you go to bed, try to think intently about a problem you wish to solve. Bury yourself in the problem by stating it clearly and reviewing all relevant information. Then use the suggestions listed in the previous section to catch your dreams. Although this method is not guaranteed to produce an original solution or a new insight, it is certain to be an adventure. About half of a group of college students using the method for a week recalled a dream that helped them solve a personal problem.www.ks5u.com"

      "Scientists estimate that more than 60 percent of cancer deaths in the United States are preventable through lifestyle changes. Although there is no certain way to avoid all cancers, reducing individual risk factors greatly decreases the likelihood of getting many forms of this dangerous disease.\nThe American Chemical Society estimates that smoking causes nearly 30 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States -- that is, about 166,000 cancer deaths each year. All cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking could be prevented completely by not smoking and not using smokeless tobacco. For those who already smoke, quitting will reduce the risk of developing cancer. Studies show that after about ten years of not smoking, a past smoker's risk lowers to about the level of those who have never smoked.\nAfter quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet is the best way to lower the risk of cancer. Certain foods have been found to protect against cancer. Among these foods are cabbages, tomatoes, soy products, and foods high in vitamins A, C, and E. In addition, green and possibly black teas contain compounds that protect the body from cancer-causing substance.\nTo lower cancer risk, diets should include little or no red meat. Other foods to avoid or consume in moderation   include sugar, fat from animal products, and salt. Added fats and oils should come from vegetables, such as olives or corn, rather than from animal sources. Carbohydrates   should come from whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat bread, rather than from processed foods, such as white rice and white bread.\nThe risk of cancer of the esophagus   increases with heavy alcohol consumption, and many studies suggest that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer as well. Studies show that limiting intake to two drinks a day for men, and one drink per day for women, reduces cancer risk.\nLow levels of physical activity have been implicated   in some cancer. Moderate activity for 30 minutes a day enhances the immune system, shortens the time food takes to move through the intestines  , and changes body composition and hormone levels. Researchers are studying how these effects might lower cancer risk."

      "Columbus made four voyages to the west between 1492 and 1504 in his vain search for a sea route to Asia. The mystery of why he failed to find it haunted  him and filled him with sadness.\nWherever he went to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, South America, Panama, down the coast of Central America--it was always the same story. Instead of golden palaces, there were grass huts and palm-leaf tents. Instead of silk-robed merchant princes, he found \"Indians\" who did not have so much as a shirt on their backs.\nWhen Columbus explored the West Indies in 1493,he heard tales of a fierce Indian tribe who literally devoured its defeated enemies after a battle. These people were called by many names in the area, including Calina, Canima, Carib, and Caniba. Columbus recorded the name of the American natives as Canibales in Spanish, a word which came to refer, within a few years, to any eater of human flesh. In the similar fashion, the word Caribbean, a title for the sea as well as for the region, came into English.\nAt times Columbus knew that this new land was not China, not Japan, not the Spice Islands. He seemed to accept it as a part of the earth that the geographers of Europe had never heard of before. It was another world--and he called it exactly that--but Columbus also insisted until he died that land he had reached was an unknown part of Asia."

      "There has been much discussion recently about reducing the weight of English in China's high-stake tests such as the national college entrance examination. It is argued by some applauding the recent change to reduce the importance of English in tests so that it will lead students to focus more on learning Chinese. The TV program Writing in Chinese has exposed the problem that students and the general public cannot write in Chinese as they used to do.\nSome blame the design of the curriculum for giving English an equal or greater amount of emphasis, which might have contributed to the failure in teaching Chinese. But this is probably not a fair accusation since children in English speaking countries cannot spell either.\nI doubt that studying English in itself hurts the study of Chinese. In fact, high achievers in English or another foreign language are more likely to be high achievers in Chinese. It has been proved many times in recent Chinese history that those capable of using a foreign language are also masters in their mother tongue. Qian Zhongshu, Lu Xun and Lin Yutang are just a few examples.\nAnother trend of thought for curriculum reform is related to the perception of \"worth\". It is true that English is one of the subjects that students do spend too much time on, with pitiful results. This makes some doubt if it is worth giving it priority. But this is not a sound argument either as students still need to study things that matter more to their future in spite of challenges learning English presents to them.\nImprovements in Chinese language education should not be achieved by sacrificing another important subject. There should be a robust  foreign language education program, as a foreign language improves a student's future job prospects. Bashing  English education as a waste of time or using it as a goat for failures in Chinese education are both harmful tendencies.\nTo be constructive, we ought to start a dialogue on ways to make improvements in learning outcomes so that students' time learning English is spent more effectively. There are a few things that could improve English education, such as assessment design,learner motivation and teaching style,\nI am sure there are many other areas where changes can greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of English learning. The public discourse at present is a little oversimplified. People are arguing for or against English having less weight in major tests, when the dialogue should be taken a step further, to the improvement of learning or teaching methods that may benefit the teaching of other subjects as well, Chinese included."

      "I want to tell you a story that changed my life many years ago. We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Saturday morning. We decided to stop at a local restaurant to get something to eat since we had enough time. When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as though he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, because that is not what \"moved\" me. A dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog owner, I knew that the dog was a mother, and that she had just had some pups  . She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved   better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had."

      "The challenge to drink to the limits of one's endurance has become a celebrated part of college life. In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )\nExperts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank \"to get drunk\" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.\n\"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ,\" says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.\nThe reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.\nWhile binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus. Facing the many potential dangers, college campuses are searching for ways to reduce binge drinking."

      "It's fun to receive presents. It also feels good to give presents to others. So what's the best way to budget your money, shop wisely and spend smartly this holiday season? Time for kids asked for advice from Susan Beacham of Money Savvy Generation, a company that teaches money-management skills to kids.\n\" My first tip is to make a list and check it twice,\" says Beacham. She suggests that kids talk with their families about whom to include in their gift giving and how much to spend. Start by writing down names, Beacham says. Then put a dollar amount next to each name and add it up. Do you have enough money? If not, make changes. And don't forget---- not everyone needs a store-bought gift. Beacham points out that some of the best presents are free. Add to your list the names of people you want to give gifts of time and talent.\nDo the match\nTake the list with you to the store and \"make sure that you do the math,\" says Beacham \" If you've spent $ 30 on someone you were going to spent $25 on, you're going to have to spend $5 less on somebody else.\" The key to budgeting is staying within the boundaries you've set for yourself.\nGifts from the heart\nThe best gifts don't cost a thing. Here are some of Beacham's top gifts ideas.\n*For parents, make coupons  that can be trade for your services, such as doing dishes.\n*For grandma, write a note telling her how special she is to you.\n*For a friend, create a work of art, like a poem, a drawing or a necklace.\n*For teachers, bake a delicious cake."

      "Mountaineers have noted that as they climb, for example, up to the 12,633foot Humphreys Peak in Arizona, plant life changes greatly. In the Sonoran Desert, one climbs into a pine forest at 7,000 feet and a treeless tundra  on the top of the mountain. It may seem that plants at a given altitude are associated in what can be called \"communities\" -groupings of species. The idea is that over time, plants that require particular climate and soil conditions come to live in the same places, and are frequently to be found together. Scientists study the history of plant life and build up a picture of how groups of plants have responded to climate changes and how ecosystems develop. But are these associations, _ are real in the present, permanent?\nA great natural experiment took place on this planet between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, when small changes in the earth's orbit caused great sheets of ice to spread from poles. These glaciers  covered much of North America and Europe to depths of up to two miles, and then, as the climate warmed, they retreated. During this retreat, they left behind newly uncovered land for living things to occupy, and as those living things moved in they laid down a record we can read now. As the ice retreated and plants started to grow near a lake, they release pollen . Some would fall into the lake, sink to the bottom and mix with the sand. By drilling into the lake bottom it is possible to read the record of the plant life around the lake. The fossil record seems clear; there is little or no evidence that entire groups of plants moved north together. Things that lived together in the past don't live together now, and things that live together now didn't live together in the past. Each individual living things moved at its own pace. The fossil record seems to be telling us that we should be thinking about preserving species by giving them room to move about-to respond to environmental changes."

      "Scholarship Application Tips in 2014 for college students\n*Before you apply\n1. Work hard to get good grades. Don't sweat about one bad grade, but always strive to do your best.\n2. Get involved, and stay involved, in extracurricular activities. Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience.\n3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.\n4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.\n*During the application process\n1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.\n2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.\n3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.\n4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.\n5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline.\n6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials.\n7. Last but not least, review your application with your parents to make sure you haven't left out any important details.\nGood luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs!"

      "PEOPLE who have had a painful experience may wish they could wipe the memory from their minds. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, US, say that this may someday be possible.\nA drug remains far off, but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain's fear center to cut memories forever.\nPrevious research had already shown that a special behavior therapy   could cut painful memories. But relapse   was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \"window of vulnerability  \" when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered   the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable   AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling   the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \"Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\" she said.\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\"Completely deleting a memory is a little scary. How do you remove a memory without removing a part of someone's life,\" Farinholt said. \"And is it best to do that, considering that people grow and learn from their experiences?\""

      "Forget Twitter and Facebook, Google and the Kindle. Television is still the most influential medium around. Indeed, for many of the poorest regions of the world, it remains the next big thing--finally becomes globally available. And that is a good thing, because the TV revolution is changing lives for the better.\nAcross the developing world, around 45% of families had a TV in 1995; by 2005 the number had climbed above 60% . That is some way behind the U.S. ,where there are more TVs than people, and where people now easily get access to the Internet. Five million more families in sub-Saharan Africa will get a TV over the next five years. In 2005 , after the fall of the Taliban ,which had banned TV, I in 5 Afghans had one. The global total is another 150 million by 2013--pushing the numbers to well beyond two thirds of families.\nTelevision's most powerful effect will be on the lives of women. In India, researchers Robert Jensen and Emily Oster found that when TVs reached villages, women were more likely to go to the market without their husbands approval and less likely to want a boy rather than a girl. They were more likely to make decisions over child health care. TV is also a powerful medium for adult education. In the Indian state of Gujarat, Chitrageet is a popular show that plays Bollywood songs with words in Gujarati on the screen. Within six months, viewers had made a small but significant improvement in their reading skills.\nToo much TV has been associated with violence, overweight and loneliness. However, TV is having a positive influence on the lives of billions worldwide."

      "It was almost six years ago that my family and I waited for her at the airport. Unsure  of what to expect and a little bitter about such an experience that my mother was forcing upon me, I had mixed feeling about the girl from Madrid. Today,after making many memories and discoveries, I couldn't be more thankful for what that experience taught me.\nMy family had the privilege to host Teresa for several summers. I became fond of her cheerful chatter, constant laughter ,and addiction to online shopping. She seldom took my unkind jokes seriously and always gave it right back to me, making our relationship closer. She could go on talking for hours about the beach outside her house, her family and  friends, and her life at her school.\nWhile several aspects were very similar to my life here, I was always left with a certain level of mystery and excitement as I wondered how the picture in my head compared with reality.\nThrough hard work, she became fluent in English in almost no time. While this was a big success for her, it made me ashamed as I was not forced to develop the little Spanish that I was learning in class. This experience aroused my interest in traveling to Europe - especially Spain. While l know that not everyone has this same interest in other culture, I believe that it is important for us to be willing to learn about what makes certain customs and activities significant to them As Americans, we may be some of the most arrogant( ) people about other culture, which history has proven can have disastrous consequences. By at least making the effort to appreciate what is important to them, we show respect to the people who have such culture.\nThrough the unique experience that in a sense I was forced into, I learned far more about the Spanish culture than I could have in any classroom. I discovered new interests that I had never considered before, and I am excited for the opportunity to experience it first-hand this summer."

      "For years, I thought that my mother would become a Centenarian    , but after 98 years and eight months, she recently died of old age. As it was with my father, her funeral took place in the most peaceful setting of the countryside of rural Washington County. Even after my father died, we continued to think of our parents as one. They were a team in the traditional sense. Church and family were their life- lines. They worked hard, never complaining. They expected to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow.\nOnce during a conversation with Tom Brokaw, who wrote the best- selling hook The Greatest Generation, I told him, \"You left out my parents.\" They didn't go off to war, but they belonged to the Greatest Generation. They, too, were part of the foundation that made America truly great. They kept the home fires burning.\nOur mother gloried in being a housewife and mother. Having been a teacher in her early adult years, when education was more important than anything else, she gave up her job to raise a family .She was an excellent cook, but she had to cook on a wood stove. There was no refrigerator, nothing electric. But nobody was ever better at making do. In addition to all the household chores and responsibilities, she went to the fields every day to help produce a crop to pay the rent and to provide for the family. She and my dad worked hard to save every penny possible.\nThey saved ever7 penny to buy a farm late in life. They also saved enough money to live out their respective live with home care without taking up residency in a nursing home. They were fiercely independent.  If you had suggested they accept a government transfer payment, they would have spit in your eye."

      "Yueyang Tower   lies in the west of Yueyang City, near the Dongting Lake. It was first built for soldiers to rest on and watch out. In the Three Kingdoms Period, Lu Su, General of Wu State, trained his soldiers here.\nIn 716, Kaiyuan of Tang Dynasty, General Zhang Shuo was sent to defend at Yuezhou and he rebuilt it into a tower named South Tower, and then Yueyang Tower. In 1044, Song Dynasty, Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun, the ancient name of Yueyang City. In the second year, he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower. Fan Zhongyan, a great artist and poet, was invited to write the well-known poem about Yueyang Tower. In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower (<<>> ), Fan writes: \"Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land, the last to enjoy universal happiness.\" His words have been well-known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before.\nThe style of Yueyang Tower is quite special. The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories, flying eave   and wood construction, the helmet-roof of such a large size is a rarity   among the ancient architectures in China.\nEntering the tower, you'll see \"Dongting is the water of the world, Yueyang is the tower of the world\". Moving on, there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three-Kingdom Period general Lu Su. To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion  in honor of Du Fu. Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door, the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides. In the garden to the north of the tower is the tomb of Xiaoqiao, the wife of Zhou Yu."

      "Most Americans receive at least two or three credit card applications in the mail every month.Why have credit cards become so popular? For a merchant, the answer is obvious.By putting charge slips  in a bank, the merchant can change credit card sales into cash.In return for processing the merchant's credit card transactions , the bank charges a fee that ranges between 1.5 and 5 percent.\n         The easiest way to establish credit is to open checking and savings accounts at your local bank.Then apply for a gasoline or store credit card.These cards are fairly easy to get because retailers  want you to buy their goods and services.The third step, and the most dangerous one, is obtaining a major credit card like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.\n       It is important to choose a credit card carefully because terms and conditions vary widely.Annual fees range from $15 to $75 a year, but some credit card companies charge no annual fee at all.If you will be one of the growing number of people who don't pay off their credit card debts in full each month, look for the card with the lowest interest rate.Interest rates generally range from 12 to 18 percent, though it is possible to find cards with lower rates.\n       A credit card can be your friend because it can get you through unexpected emergencies.And if there is a problem with the products or service you purchase with your credit card, you have an opportunity to hold back payment by asking the credit card company to \"charge back\" to the retailer until the argument is settled.Monthly credit card statements can also help you keep your records in order.Finally, if you make payments on time, the card helps you to establish a good credit history.\n       A credit card can be your enemy because it is an invitation to purchase items you really do not need.The credit card companies' continuous offers of minimum payments, cash advances, and even months without payments may seem like a way to skate through a money crisis.In reality, your finance charges and fees only increase, and you go deeper into debt.\n       If you do find yourself in trouble, do not ignore the bills.Contact your creditors to explain your problem and express your desire to pay down your card balance.If that fails, a nonprofit organization like Consumer Credit Counseling Service can assist you in getting back on your financial feet."

      "It is the goal of politicians everywhere-----how to win and keep the trust of voters.\n  Now researchers at the University of St Anurew's in Scotland say they may have the answer. They believe politicians could learn a lot from recent advances in science. A growing number of studies have shown that people do judge a book by its cover. Researchers say most of us make quick judgments about a person on the basis of how they look.\n  Studies suggest that people are less likely to trust those with particularly masculine  features, such as a square jaw, small eyes or a big nose. \" They are considered dominant  and less trustworthy,\" says Ms Cornwell. \"It doesn't mean that men who look more masculine are less trustworthy-----it's just our first impression.\" Those with less masculine features-----larger eyes, a smaller nose and thinner lips are thought to be more trustworthy.\n  The researchers are putting their science to the test at the Royal Society's annual summer exhibition in London. They have copied the faces of Prime Minister Tony Blair, Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy stressing their dominant and trustworthy features. \" We have used a computer program to change the shape of their faces and features. We hope it will help people to understand our work.\"\n  So should we expect to see them at the exhibition getting tips?\n  \"I don't think it's something they will want to try,\" says Ms Cornwell. \"It's not really possible with television. We all know what they look like.\""

      "Being able to experience a different environment and custom will give us a new perspective on everything we thought we knew and understood. Maybe, going abroad is an opportunity to look again at not only the country and the people who live there but also ourselves.\nI had never expected to visit Paris. The French culture didn' t interest me that much, and Paris seemed too big, too touristy, too much. But when I found myself standing next to the Opera National de Paris, completely alone and totally lost, I knew I was in for an interesting ride. I had decided to take a summer history class abroad, and Paris just happened to be where it was set. My teacher eventually found me and other jet-lagged students and walked us down to where we would be staying. Even then, tired, hungry, and feeling displaced, I was unable to keep myself from marveling at the beauty of the city.\nThe next day in the grocery store, trying to decide if the box I was holding contained butter or cream cheese, I suddenly realized I was a foreigner that didn't speak the language.The cashier and I had a conversation completely with gestures. For the most part, it didn't seem to bother the French that I was utterly incompetent in speaking their language. In fact, from my first unclear \"bonjour\" , many of them would directly switch over to English.\nTime Hew by. In the mornings we had class, and in the afternoons we were given a lot of freedom to do what we pleased. We explored everywhere in the city, becoming experts at using the Metro, and walking so much that our legs were sore every night.\nLiving in Paris was a huge change in my lifestyle. Everything I did was more relaxed. I stopped worrying about the future and instead focused on living in the present. I stopped wearing a watch because time didn't matter.We ate when we were hungry, went to bed when we were tired and explored in between.I no longer mind that Paris is so big; it' s an old, beautiful metropolis full of culture and history.On one of my last days there, standing on top of the Arc du Triumph with a 360 degree view of Paris, I finally admitted something to myself.The city that I had never wanted to visit had turned into the city that I never wanted to leave."

      "Long after the 1998 World Cup was won, disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team. A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.\nThe researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.\nObservers noted down the referees' errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.\nThe researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the action. The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters. The research shows the optimum   distance is about 20 meters.\nThere also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.\nIf FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.\nHe also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided. If keeping up with the action is not so important, their physical condition is less critical."

      "We've all heard the phrase \"love is patient\", but one couple in prefix = st1 /Michigan, took this phrase to a whole new level. On Monday, February 13, Willard Mason sat down to talk about his relationship with the love he lost more than 60 years ago. Good fortune and fate recently helped the couple reunite.\nIn 1941, Willard Mason and Llah Ost, both senior 2 students, became engaged to be married and began planning their lives together. But Willard moved away to work at Willow Run Bomber Plant, where he met and fell in love with a woman named Helvi. He broke off his long distance engagement to Llah and married Helvi in 1942. Llah later found love with someone else. Both had happy marriages and raised families. \nThen, in 2003, Helvi died. A year later, Willard found himself back in his hometown, where by chance, he ran into Llah's brother. He informed Willard of the death of Llah's husband, and encouraged him to call her. \nAfter that first phone call, the couple began dating. Willard made the drive from his home near Houghton Lake to Llah's home in Adrian. On one such trip, he blacked out, and his car hit a tree. He was rushed to a hospital, where tests showed that he needed a new pacemaker . Willard moved closer to Adrianand asked Llah to move in with him. She gladly accepted.\n\"We get along perfectly,\" Willard told AZ Central on Monday. \"We've never had an argument, she's a great cook, and she takes care of me.\" \nAlthough both Willard and Llah are saddened by the 62 years they spent without each other, neither seem to have any regrets. Willard told AZ Central, \"You don't know how our lives might have turned out if we'd gotten married in 1941, but now she has a wonderful family, and so do I.\""

      "A single letter written by Albert Einstein was sold for more than $400, 000. But could an e-mail printout or an electronic file reach similar heights? That's the question facing those who deal in the literary artifacts of public figures, as they struggle to work out how to do business in the electronic world where information can be copied and spread out more easily than ever before.\n\"Booksellers, collectors and libraries are already trading in digital objects,\" Joan Winterkorn, a researcher told people. When Emory University Library bought author Slaman Rushdie's archives   in 2006, it received a desktop computer, three laptops, a hard drive and a smart phone along with his paper flies. And the writer John Updike, who died last month, started using computers in the 1980s, Winterkorn pointed out, so his \"papers\" will include a big store of electronic documents.\nSo far, however, digital archives have been traded as just a small part of a larger, mainly paper-based archive. Indeed, no one is quite sure how much the digital documents of a historical figure are worth.\n _ \" said Gabriel Heaton, a literary manuscript specialist, adding that more tangible   digital objects were easier for auctioneers   to price and sell, \"What about a laptop? For example, the one used by J. K. Rowling to write Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in an Edinburgh cafe has real value,\" he said. \"Because she used it.\" Even if the hard drive had been cloned by a library, the artifact would still be valuable.\nGordon Bell, from Microsoft Research, suggested that prices will actually fall to almost nothing. \"Once it's been copied and spread out the value is gone. It's just a piece of memory.\""

      "It has been argued that an infant under three who is cared for outside the home may suffer because of the separation from his parents.The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby believes that separation from the parents during the sensitive \"attachment\" period from birth to three may scar   a child's personality and incline to emotional problems in later life.Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be sent to day care before the age of three, and many people do believe this.But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion.\nFirstly, anthropologists   point out that the hidden love between children and parents found in modem societies does not usually exist in traditional societies.For example, we saw earlier that among the Ngonis the father and mother of a child did not raise their infant alone.But traditional societies are so different from modern societies that comparisons based on just one factor are hard to understand.\nSecondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents and caretakers found that children had problems with it.But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects.The possibility that such care might lead to more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be noticed by the use of statistics.Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial.\nThirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have reported that day care had a neutral of slightly positive effect on children's development.But tests that have had to be used to measure this development are not widely enough accepted to settle the issue."

      "Every day we meet people in a number of business and social situations. And the way we meet and greet them creates an impression. It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.\n*Always stand when making an introduction.\nWhen you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.\n*Always keep eye contact while making an introduction.\nMany people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\n*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\n*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name. This is not the ideal situation, of course, but it does happen to all of us. The other person should be forgiving."

The idea was to reunite Europe after the Second World War.\nAt the same time, the \"Fringe\" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years.\nSoon,groups of studentsfirstly from Edinburgh University, and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by little-known writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh.\nToday the \"Fringe\",once less recognized, has far outgrown the festival with around 1,500 performances of theatre,music and dance on every one of the 21 days it lasts. And yet as early as 1959,with only 19 theatre groups performing,some said it was getting too big.\nA paid administrator was first employed only in 1971, and today there are eight administrators working all year round and the number rises to 150 during August itself.

      "The southwest of Australia has been named as one of 25\"hot spots\" for future species extinction because of global warming.A new study says global warming will become a top cause of extinction across the world,with thousands of species of plantsand animals likely to be wiped out in the coming decades.\nAccording to the study,global warming ranks among the most serious threats to the planet's biodiversity and,under some conditions,may be more than that due to deforestation.This study provides even stronger scientific evidence that global warming will result in catastrophic species losses across the planet.Last month,a UN study said humans were responsible for the worst extinction and urged extra efforts to reach a UN target of slowing the rate of losses by 2010.\nScientists disagree about how far global warming is to blame compared with other human threats such as deforestation,pollution and the introduction of some species to new habitats.But the new study looks at the 25 \"hot spots\"--areas that contain a big concentration of plants and animals--and predicts that 11.6 percent of all species,with a range from 1 to 43 percent,could be driven to extinction if levels of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere were to keep rising in the next 100 years.\nThe range would mean the loss of thousands of species.The study gave a wide range because of uncertainties, for instance, about the ability of animals or plants to move towards the poles if the climate warmed. Rare plants,tortoises or birds found only on the southern tip of Africa cannot move south because the nearest land is thousands of miles away in Antarctica."

He fell in love for nine days in Mexico, wore a turban   and a long beard in Sudan, ate snake in China, and was escorted   by armed soldiers in the Philippines.www.ks5u.com\nUpon his return on Sunday, Beliveau reunited with his mother, whom she had not seen throughout his 11 years on the road. She welcomed him in a tight embrace.\nLongtime girlfriend Luce Archambault, who offered Beliveau emotional and financial   support throughout his journey, and his two children from a previous   marriage were also on hand for the celebration.\nMore than 100 supporters walked the final kilometers with Beliveau through the streets of Montreal.\nArchambault, who flew to join Beliveau wherever he was once a year so they could spend Christmas together, said last month: \"I'm his Penelope and he is my Ulysses.\""

      "There is an English saying that goes, \"he who laughs last, laughs the hardest.\" High School Musical star and teen heartthrob  Zac Efron is laughing a lot these days.\n  As a young boy, Efron was picked on in school because he was always the smallest in his class and teased because he had a big space between his teeth. In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team! They scored and his team lost the game.\n  But history, as they say, is a thing of the past. Now at 21, Efron is one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People, graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly, Hollywood's most influential magazine, and is traveling the world promoting the third High School Musical film. Director Adam Shankman described Efron as \"arguably the biggest teen star in America right now.\" Simply google \"Zac Efron\" and you get more than 14 million responses. Yes, it seems Efron has a lot to smile about these days.\n  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, \"he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown.\" It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.\n  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.\n   \"You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire,\" Efron said. \"Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above.\"\n   Efron has risen all the way to the top of the movie business. And he can now laugh all the way to the bank."

      "SYDNEY--Australia's economic boom is encouraging a steady stream of unexpected visitors looking for work: Americans.\nU.S. citizens are heading to Australia in small but growing numbers as near-10% unemployment at home drives more to look for jobs Down Under, where China's thirst for iron ore   and energy is transforming the Pacific nation into an economic powerhouse.\nA bricklaying student from Silver Trowel, a leading provider of quality education and training in the building and construction industry, apprentices   on a building project in Western Australia, where workers are in short supply.\nDaniel Davila, a 23-year-old floorer from Camarillo, California made the 14-hour move across the Pacific two years ago. He had been forced to take a job stocking shelves at a local grocery store for $8.90 an hour when he couldn't get work fixing floors.\nOn a good day in Australia, he now makes as much as 50 Australian dollars (US$50.21) an hour--about twice the amount for a typical flooring job in the U.S. He plans to start his own flooring business. \n\"I can make what I did in a week in the U.S. in less than a day here,\" said Mr. Davila, who lives near a mining boom town in Western Australia.\nAustralian government figures show just under 7,000 Americans currently working on long-term visas, an 80% jump over the past five years. U.S. citizens are now the third-largest group applying for so-called 457 work visas, after British and Indian nationals. Americans with degrees in areas such as accounting or mine engineering, as well as other skilled workers, can obtain a nonrenewable  permit for as much as a three-year stay. After that, they can apply for the renewable 457, which allows up to a four-year stay. \nThe need for workers is particularly pressing in Western Australia. The mining state's unemployment rate was 4.5% in November, below the national average of 5.2%. Drivers of heavy trucks can pull in six-figure salaries while experienced crane   operators can earn hundreds of thousands a year. Attracting skilled workers is a shift for Australia, which historically sent many of its most highly educated to the U.S. and Europe, according to migration data."

      "You can never be too sure these days in the United States of your neighbours or even your customers! Try to keep a low profile in your neighborhood: don't announce to just about everyone that you are running a home business with thousands of dollars worth of equipment. As much as possible, don't invite clients or visitors to your home. In fact I know of some home-based entrepreneurs who would rather meet their clients in a neutral ground, e.g. the client's office or even Starbucks.\n    There are other ways to keep burglars away from your house.\n    *Keep lights on around your house in the evenings. Light is a natural fright for burglars.\n*Invest in a security alarm, particularly if your house is located in a remote spot. Security systems can often bring down the cost of your homeowner's insurance premiums .\n*Make sure that all windows and doors are locked and the security alarm turned on before you sleep at night or go out of the house. Avoid keeping house keys in obvious places, such as under the lamp or top of the doorframe.\n*Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The dead-lock, sometimes called an \"exit-only deadbolt\" is an deadbolt that doesn't have an external key. It's clearly visible on the door from the outside, but can't be broken into without destroying the door, frame, or lock itself. While the security won't help directly when you aren't home, the visibility may discourage an  _ from trying the door.\n*Your door itself should be made of strong materials, such as one-inch thick solid hardwood or heavy metal."

      "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve."

Since then, he never stopped searching clues which might lead him to that place of wonder. He read widely to collect information.\nTaking a little from here and there, he got quite a clear idea of what the Island was really like. It was a secret place, where all the great men learn and invent together. To be able to join that select club, you had to have created great inventions. Only then could you receive the invitation.\nTo get a chance, Luca spend the years studying and inventing. Every new idea he got, he made it into an invention, and if there were anything he didn't understand, he would seek help. Soon he met other brilliant inventors too, and he told them of the secrets of the Island. These young inventors would likewise dream of being sent \"the letter\".\nAs time passed, the disappointment of not being sent the letter gave rise to even greater cooperation and help between them. Their inventions soon became known throughout the world.\nBut no invention came.\nThey didn't lose heart. They continued learning and inventing, trying to come up with better ideas. Fresh talent was added to their group. One day, Luca, already very old, was speaking with a brilliant young man who had written to join their group. Luca told the young man the secrets of the Island, and of how he was sure that they would receive an invitation. Surprised, the young inventor said: \"What? You mean this isn't really the Island of Inventions?\"\nIt inspired Luca and he realized that his dream had become true."

      "\"A good parent\" can be a confusing phrase. It is almost impossible for one person to be \"a good parent\" at all stages of a child's life. Some parents are at their best before their children begin to speak. Others are most successful before their children enter elementary school. Still others make their finest contribution to older children or teenagers. Every parent can understand one stage of a child's development better than another. It is hard for a person to possess superior capacities throughout the entire period of a child's growth.\nA mother might be \"a good parent\" from her baby's birth until it is three; that is the period when it needs her protection and loving care. Then the start of her child's independence might upset and alarm her, and she might then become less helpful for a few years. A father might be awkward and uncomfortable with a younger child, but could turn into an excellent parent when the child is old enough to be taught the skills of cycling, fishing and so on, or to be taken on trips. Some parents feel easier with boys, and others with girls -- and then only at certain ages or stages.\nIt is important for parents to understand and accept their own limitations in these matters, just as they must accept the child's faults of personality and limitations of talent. Otherwise, fathers and mothers will feel guilty and blame themselves for weaknesses that may not be their faults. Much of the guilt experienced by modern parents comes from the mistaken feeling that they ought to be all things at all times to the child, which is clearly mistaken. In past ages, grandparents and uncles and aunts lived with the family, and provided different kinds of support; in our present \"nuclear\" family, too many roles are demanded of the two parents, which they cannot possibly fulfill."

      "Teenage life is quite dramatic but that doesn't mean you cannot enjoy your life in these years. Even with your daily troubles, your life is not very hard if you know how to deal with them.\nI know exactly how you feel. Life as a teenager can be hard. You are not a kid anymore, because you are smart enough to observe and analyze your surroundings. However, you are still not an adult because there are still lots of experiences that you need to have and lessons that you need to learn from these experiences. To top it all, the hormonal  imbalance in your body can really mess you up emotionally. I have been there. I was in it for 6 years exploring what life is about.\nAs a teenager, I had a major problem with completing my chores  on time. And at that time, all that I need to do was finish my assignments, study for the upcoming test and clean my room. Now, I have lots of things to do: cooking, cleaning and working while striking a balance between all my relationships related to work, family and friends. That really is a lot of work. So, I will just give you one golden tip, quoting from Benjamin Franklin, \"Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.\"\nLife becomes much easier because I finish all my work on time and I have enough time to _ . Half the problems as a teenager are because we hate doing things. We'd rather go and have fun than sit down and take care of our duties and responsibilities. That is why you have so much trouble in your life; your parents won't let you go out with friends because you didn't clean your room or your professor is always criticizing you because you haven't finished your assignments."

      "\"Family\" is of course an _ word. But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother ,father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband. He will be entirely responsible for her financial support, and she for the running of the new home. Their children will be their common responsibility and theirs alone. Neither the wife's parents nor the husband's, nor their brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, have any right to interfere with them--they are their own masters.\nReaders of novels like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice will know that in former times marriage among wealthy families were arranged by the girl's parents, that is, it was the parents' duty to find a suitable husband for their daughter, preferably a rich one, and by skillful encouragement to lead him eventually to ask their permission to marry her. Until that time, the girl was protected and maintained in the parents' home, and the financial relief of getting rid of her could be seen in their giving the newly married pair a sum of money called a dowry. It is very different today. Most girls of today get a job when they leave school and become financially independent before their marriage. This has had two results. A girl chooses her own husband, and she gets no dowry."

      "Unemployment in Europe has recently hit record highs. Although Denmark has been protected from economic problems thanks to its low public debt, qualified   professionals are still finding it tough to get a job. Danish marketing firm Reputation Copenhagen has come up with a way of helping academics get noticed -- putting them on display   in storefront windows.\nMany highly-trained professionals, ranging from former CEOs to lawyers and tax experts, are currently finding it increasingly difficult to find proper employment on the Danish job market. Some of them have been trying for years, leaving their resumes   with dozens of companies, without ever hearing back from them, and are now at a point where they are willing to try anything, even putting themselves in display windows like goods, hoping to get noticed.\nAlexander Peitersen, managing director of Reputation Copenhagen, came up with the idea of using his company's office as a storefront for the campaign  , as there are many businesses nearby that might be interested in the talents on display. So he set up a small desk, put up the \"an available academic is sitting here\" sign and asked the unemployed to just sit in the windows like goods. It seems like a pretty desperate measure, but at least it works. According to the agency's website, three of the jobseekers in their window display got a job in a day or two.\nPeitersen says he came up with the idea after realizing human resource managers get hundreds of job applications every day, which look more or less the same, and that creative thinking is required in order to increase the chances of finding employment. Apart from companies interested in qualified job-seekers, the campaign has also attracted the attention of both local and international media."

He was going a bit too fast in his shiny, black, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, which was only two months old.\nHe was watching for kids rushing out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no child came out, but a brick sailed out and - WHUMP!  - it hit the Jaguar's shiny black side door! SCREECH ... ! ! ! ! Immediately Josh stopped the car, jumped out, seized the kid and pushed him up against a parked car. He shouted at the kid, \"What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?!\" \"That's my new Jaguar, that brick you threw is gonna cost you a lot of money. Why did you throw it?\"\n\"Please, mister, please...I'm sorry!

He's hurt and he's too heavy for me. \"\nMoved by the words, the young businessman lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scrapers and cuts, checking to see that everything was going to be OK.

      "Many parents watch the news or other shows as children play nearby. But new research shows that even when the television is just background noise,it may be\nto a child's normal development.\nIt's estimated that 75 percent of very young children in the United States live in homes where the television is on most of the time,even though the kids often aren't watching it. The University of Massachusetts researchers recently studied how TV background noise might affect young children. The study looked at 50 1,2and 3yearolds. Each child came to a lab with a parent and was allowed to play for an hour with various toys. For half the time,a television was on in the room,showing the adult game show as well as advertisements. During the other half hour,the TV was turned off.\nAs expected,the children paid little attention to the adult television show,glancing at it for less than a few seconds at a time,and less than once a minute. Even so,the distraction   of the background noise had a significant effect on how children at every age played. When the television was on,the children played with each toy for far shorter periods of time,and focused attention during play was also shorter compared to how they played when the TV was off.\nResearchers said that even though the children aren't interested in the show,background TV affects their ability to do various types of play. The finding is important because many wellmeaning parents who wouldn't let their young children watch television may not realize that even adult programs that don't interest children still can have an effect.\n\"Background TV is potentially a chronic   environmental risk factor affecting most American children,\" said the lead author of the study. \"Parents should limit their young children's exposure  .\""

      "Is your family interested in buying a dog? A dog can be a pleasant companion to your family, but if you choose the wrong kind of dog , you will have a lot of troubles.\nFamilies should sit down and discuss the possible problems before buying a dog. Even if the children in your family are the ones who want the dog, the parents are the ones who are really responsible for seeing that the animal is properly cared for. If you don't know much about dogs, it is a good idea to go to the library for books about different kinds of dogs, and books about how to train a young dog. In reading about the different breeds you should know that a dog described as very alert may be too active. When a book describes a dog as an excellent hunting dog, it probably means that the dog won't be happy living in a small house. Dog breeds vary in popularity as the years go by. One of the most popular dogs these days is the German shepherd. This is because it provides protection as well as companionship. The family should be warned that these dogs grow up to be very big, and may be too powerful for children to control. If space is limited, a toy dog may be a good choice. These dogs are very small and easy to train. They don't need to be walked daily, since they can exercise in the home."

      "Dear Mr. King, \nYour grocery store is outstanding in many ways. I enjoy the selection of produce and fresh bakery items. I have been a long time Supermart shopper and hope to continue for many years. I have found, however, that I must make a separate shopping trip to one of your competitors because there are many items your store does not carry. This becomes inconvenient for me, as my time is valuable, and I do not like to make two trips. Your low prices and excellent customer service keep me coming back to Supermart, but I would be a more satisfied customer if I could find all the items I need in one place. \nSpecifically, I have never been able to purchase nacho cheese soup at your store. I can find other flavors   of soup, but your store does not carry nacho cheese soup, a common ingredient   in many of my recipes. In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers, while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers. Another example is Regent Brand Chili Seasoning. Though it is not a leading brand, it is still common on the shelves of other grocery stores in this area and is superior in flavor to its competitors. \nI sincerely hope to continue a relationship with your store, and I hope that you will consider the possibility of expanding your goods to be more competitive. \nYours truly, \nBob Watson"

      "Grown-ups are often surprised by how well they remember something they learned as children but have never practiced ever since. A man who has not had a chance to go swimming for years can still swim as well as ever when he gets back in the water. He can get on a bicycle after many years and still ride away. He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\nOne explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it.\nIn childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn.\nThe multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned. A little overlearning, on the other hand, is really necessary for one's future development"

      "Monkeys are very similar to us in many ways. We enjoy watching them because they often act like us. In fact, scientists say monkeys and humans share a common ancestor.\nMonkeys make us smile, too, because they are creatures full of playful tricks. This is why many monkey expressions are about tricky people or playful acts. One of these expressions is monkeyshines, meaning tricks or foolish acts. So, when a teacher says to a group of students: \"Stop those monkeyshines right now!\", you know that the kids are playing, instead of studying.\nYou might hear that same teacher warn a student not to monkey around with a valuable piece of equipment. You monkey around with something when you are touching or playing with something you should leave alone. Also, you can monkey around when you feel like doing something, but have no firm idea of what to do.\n Monkey business usually means secret, maybe illegal, activities. A news report may say there is monkey business involved in building the new airport, with some officials getting secret payments from builders.\nYou may make a monkey out of someone when you make that person look foolish. Some people make a monkey out of themselves by acting foolish or silly.\nIf one monkey has fun, imagine how much fun a barrel of monkeys can have. If your friend says he had more fun than a barrel of monkeys at your party, you know that he had a really good time.\nMonkey suits are common names for clothes or uniforms soldiers wear. In earlier years, performing monkeys' tight-fitting, color1ful jacket looked similar to a military uniform. So, people began to call a military uniform a monkey suit."

      "WILD WEATHERMAN\nName: Sam Champion\nHot job: TV Weatherman\nWhere: ABC-TV, New York City\nWhen you were a child, did you plan to forecast wind, rain, and snow on TV?\nI wanted to be a foreign journalist. I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.\nHow did you finally become a weatherman?\nMy first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.\nBack then, how did you forecast weather?\nIndependent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.\nHas weather forecasting changed much with new technology?\nAdvanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.\nAny advice for children who'd like to become weather scientists?\nTo me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth's weather secrets. So get a general knowledge of Earth science, and study meteorology in college.\nThanks, Sam."

      "What I like to advise people is to find out what it is that makes them happy. What do you love to do? If you truly love what you do just go ahead and try to make a living by doing it. People will throw money at you to do it. But you will always have to work hard at it. I have to draw every single day of my life. I have to draw about 20 ideas. My advice is to put aside a certain amount of time every day and make you draw or whatever, especially when you don't feel like it. Only in this way will you be able to perfect your talent.\nThe first step you take is to go to your local library and ask for the publications issued in the current years. When you get these publications, try to find the names of the top people concerned and their presidents. After you find these, write down their names and addresses. Keep this list and update it every year. Next thing you want to do is to create at least 40 cartoons. Get a grid  from one of the strips in the newspapers, enlarge it to whatever size you wish and draw inside this grid. Now take the best 20 of your ideas and make them into finished pieces. To do this, you would want to copy them in ink because if you were a professional cartoonist, that was what you should do. Now you can reduce the size of the finished cartoons to fit onto a regular comic's page. By comparing yours with the others already in print, it gives you a good idea of clarity to your cartoon.\nThe next step is to write letters to presidents of the publication. In the letters, explain who you think would read your work, or in other words, what group do you think you would target. After you complete these, send all of your information enclosed with letters in the appropriate envelope.\nNow as soon as you send out these letters, start to create a brand new strip with all new characters. Don't _ because if your idea gets turned down then you will give up. And always remember. If you receive a rejection from any of them, keep in mind that you are working on something better. You will be working on something new and more exciting and the rejection letter will not have any impact. With this in mind..."

      "Claressa was getting ready for a fight. She had boxed many times before. But this time, the prizes were higher than ever. If she won this fight, Claressa would win a spot on the US Olympic Women's Boxing Team.\nThe fight was difficult. Claressa was up against a two-time US champion. \"Her whole game plan was to hold me against the ropes so I wouldn't hit her,\"says Claressa. Claressa didn't give up. She won the fight. And that wasn't all. She also won the title of outstanding fighter for the whole tournament!\nClaressa, now 17, started boxing when she was just 11. She was inspired by her dad. He had been a fighter when he was younger. But when she first told her dad that she wanted to box, he didn't support her. \"He told me, 'No! No! Boxing is a man's sport,'\" Claressa remembers. \"It made me so mad.\"\nClaressa wouldn't back down. \"I wanted to fight. I knew that whatever I put my heart and my work into, I was going to be successful at it,\" she says. Finally, her dad took her to the boxing gym to start training. She was the only girl. \"Everybody was looking at me,\" she says.\nClaressa didn't worry about fitting in. She just did her best. Claressa now has a boxing record of 23 wins and zero losses. \"I think you're awesome,\" her dad told her not long ago. He's proud that she proved him wrong.\"I'm still proving people wrong,\" says Claressa.\nBoxing can be dangerous. How does Claressa feel when she steps into the ring? \"I'm not nervous,\" she says. \"I'm determined and calm.\" She knows it's important to stay confident. \"I've never gotten into the ring thinking that a girl can beat me,\" she adds. But Claressa takes the competition seriously. \"I always tell myself it's going to be harder than I think,\" she says. \"I fight them all like they are world champions. If I think it's going to be easy, I'm done!\"\n  We asked Claressa to imagine stepping into the ring at the Olympics. Would it feel any different from her other fights? \"No,\" she says. \"Just a fight. Just another girl in my way.\""

      "Teachers and textbooks  _ -- your future could be under threat from a quickly developing and very smart technology.\n     University of California researchers led by Jacob White hill recently programmed teaching robots to react to facial expression. Whitehill's achievement marked a major step forward in the way people could one day learn by establishing facial expression recognition in robot teachers.\n     The teaching robots or, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that provide personalized instruction and feedback to students without human intervention. The facial expression recognition allows a computer to react according to expressions a user makes.\n     He said that the system was an important development in improving learning systems.\n\"Classical ITS typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of 'first I ask a questions then I wait for a responses then I talk some more; then I wait for another response.' Facial expression recognition, I believe, will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking,\" Whitehill said.\n     Experts agree the latest developments in ITS open new possibilities for how people could learn. University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$ I. 3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive , one-on-one instruction.\n     \"The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios ,\" he said.\n     Although robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as-- if not more effective than human teachers.\n     \"The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience,\" Olney said.\n     So, what is the future for today's teachers, classrooms, and textbooks?"

      "It should be very clear that we live in a most spectacular time. It's a time when information is of primary importance. It's a time when new information technologies are fundamentally transforming the world in every aspect. Among the changes, which have come upon modern society, the ones in education are probably the most obvious and influential. New information technologies are accelerating changes in education, at the same time presenting revolutionary tools with the potential to make education more efficient and more effective than ever.\nThe application of new information technologies has remarkably promoted the process of education. Online learning is probably the best case in point. As is often the case with \"technology\", online learning may appear to be horrible; it can sound like alphabet soup sometimes. Now let's see whether you can understand all this. You can participate in CBT at a CLC via the convenience of IDL. What does it all mean? Let me translate: GBT--Computer-Based Training; CLC--Computer Learning Center; IDL--Interactive Distance Learning. Sound complicated? Not really. Online learning is much less complicated than it seems. Students can learn at any time, anywhere, at any speed. They can make their own learning schedules and follow their own paths to suit their lifestyles. In my university, every semester there're several online courses available, which need no class meetings or paper materials. The only thing I have to do is just to get online regularly as I wish, and download necessary learning materials. Then everything I need to know about the course is only a click away.\nBut online learning is not perfect; it's like the microwave oven: it does some things better, but it is not a complete replacement for the traditional model. The traditional classroom model for education and learning is hard to leave behind. Because humans are social creatures, there're times when we need to see each other face-to-face for interactive learning. A social and personal connection often builds effective teams, solves problems, and inspires confidence. So one possible solution is to combine online learning with the old traditional classroom learning , which not only makes the learning process faster and cheaper, but also highlights the interactions between teachers and students.\nThe bottom line: the Internet is the most important educational tool in the information age and online learning will become a main part of every individual's learning experience in the future. That's exactly how we will move knowledge from the ones who have it to the ones who need it faster and cheaper, and that's how we're going to survive in the information age."

      "A person named Bernard Jackson today is a free man, but he has many bitter memories. He spent five years in prison after a jury  wrongly convicted (...) him of raping two women. At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the time of the crime, he was convicted  anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who had attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a group of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs of similar faces. The number of people in the group, and whether it is a person or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.\nMany people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not true. Two psychologists showed a film of crimes to both police officers and civilians. The psychologists found no difference between the police and the civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes.\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. Sometimes it is the only evidence to a crime, such as rape. Furthermore, eyewitness testimony is often correct. Although people do sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony. It is their responsibility to decide if a certain witness could actually see, hear and remember what happened."

      "One day while shopping in a small town in southern California,it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality conflicted with mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing,and marched angrily out of the store. My hostility  toward that clerk increased with each step.\nOn the outside,standing by the road,was a darkskinned young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine,and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling  smile covered his face. I gave way immediately. The magnetic  power of that smile dissolved  all bitterness within me,and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding .\n\"Beautiful day,isn't it?\"I remarked,in passing. Then,I turned back.\"I really owe you a debt of gratitude ,\"I said softly.\nHis smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer.A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby.The woman stepped forward and volunteered, \"Sir, but he doesn't speak English.Do you want me to tell him something?\" In that moment I felt transformed .The young man's smile had made a big person of me.My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall.\n\"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly puzzled.\nI gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave.\"Just tell him that,\" I insisted.\"He'll understand.I am sure !\"\nOh, what a smile can do!

      "Among the many differences between Western and Chinese cultures, table manners are one of the most noticeable  differences. Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.\nStep1:\nKeep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person."

Let your date know that you are expected to call or tell that person when you get in.\nSimilarly, if you leave a party with someone you do not know well, make sure you tell another person you are leaving and with whom. Ask a friend to call and make sure you arrive home safely.\nNo matter how good the person appears to you, trust your inner instincts . If a situation makes you uncomfortable, try to stay calm and think of a way to remove yourself from the situation without letting your date realize what is going on in your mind.\nBe aware of your decreased ability to react under the influence of alcohol or drugs and keep yourself in control when out for a date.\nAlways stay firm, straightforward and clear in your relationships, thoughts, decisions and judgments. Never let a doubt come to your mind or face when out\nfor dating. If you are firm and clear in your communication, your date will always be careful in dealing with you.\nYou should think ahead about ways to be safe if you are in a dangerous or potentially dangerous relationship.

      "It seems that men are under more stress when stuck in a traffic jam than women. British researchers for the GPS company TomTom used saliva  to decide the stress levels. Levels for women were far lower than levels for men. Most of the people taking part in the research, men and women, reported that they didn't feel any stress at all. Even with that report, their saliva told a different story. In fact, people are under stress while in traffic and not even realizing it. That does not mean good things for health. People can only do something about their health if they know something is wrong.\nMen are more likely to have much less patience than women. That is why their stress levels are much higher than women when they are sitting still in traffic. Men want to get where they are going now.\n72% of people taking part in the research drove every day. Of course, 86% believed that traffic affected their lives in a bad way. Being stuck in traffic after a stressful day at work could raise the level to an even higher level. The more likely they are to get further stressed.\nStress from being stuck in traffic is also related to a higher chance of getting into car accidents. It is wise to avoid driving when already feeling stressed. Calm down for a few minutes, take a deep breath and drive as safely as possible. Driving with too much stress could cost you or someone else their life. It is not worth the danger. Reduce the amount of stress that you are experiencing before getting into the car and find ways to relax more when stuck in traffic. One way to relax is to have soothing music to play during these times."

      "Taiwanese fishing boats that sailed to the Diaoyu Islands to protest Japan's \"purchase\" of part of the islands completed their voyage Tuesday morning and have set sail for home.\nLocal media reported that the boats finished their protest at 9:15 a.m. and are expected to return to a port in northeast Taiwan's Yilan county at noon Wednesday.\nAlthough the boats originally numbered 75,they were joined at sea by other boats from different parts of Taiwan, raising the total number to about 100 vessels. Organizers said the voyage was made to protect Taiwanese fishing rights in nearby waters and to protest Japan's \"purchase\" of part of the Diaoyu Islands.\nThe Japanese government announced a plan to \"purchase\" part of the islands earlier this month despite repeated protests from the Chinese government. The action aroused demonstrations across China as well as consumers' boycott of Japanese products in recent weeks. Local authorities in Taiwan have also protested the move.\n\"Japan's purchase and nationalization of China's Diaoyu Islands are putting China-Japan economic and trade ties at risk due to man-made factors.\" An official spokesman from Beijing warned .\nChina-Japan economic and trade relations was back on track in 1952 when the two countries signed their first non-governmental trade agreement. Currently, China has been Japan's largest trade partner since 2007 while Japan is China's fourth largest trade partner, after the EU, U.S. and the ASEAN. Meanwhile, China is the biggest destination for Japanese exports and biggest source of imports. In the first half of 2012, Japan's exports to China totaled 73.54 billion U.S. dollars, down 6.2 percent from the same period last year, while its import from China was 91.29 billion U.S. dollars, up 7 percent from the same period last year.\nNow, China-Japan economic and trade relations are at a crossroads.

      "How words came into being is unknown. All we assume   is that some early men invented certain sounds,in one way or another,to express thoughts and feelings,actions and things,so that they could talk with each other. Later they agreed upon certain signs,called letters,which could be put together to show those sounds,and which could be written down. Those sounds,whether spoken or written in letters, are called words.\nThe power of words,then,lies in their associations--the things they bring up to our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience;and the longer we live,the more certain words bring back to us the happy and sad events of our past;and the more we read and learn,the more the number of words that mean something to us increases.\nGreat writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which have powerful effects on our minds and feelings. This clever use of words is what we call literary style  .Above all,the real poet is a master of words. He can express his meaning in words which sing like music,and which by their position and association can move men to tears. We should therefore learn to choose our words carefully and use them correctly,or they will make our speech silly and common."

      "Thanksgiving  Day was near. The first grade teacher gave her class a fun task----to draw a picture of something for which they were thankful.\nMost of the class would celebrate the holiday with turkey  and other traditional goodies  of season. These, the teacher thought, would be the subjects of her students' art. And they were. But Douglas made a different kind of picture. He drew a hand. Nothing else. Just an empty hand. Douglas was a different kind of boy. Most of the time, as other children played together, Douglas was likely to stand close by her side. Everyone could guess the pain he felt from his eyes.\nHis picture interested other students. Whose hands could it be? One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer, because farmers raise turkeys. Another suggested a police officer, because the police protect and care for people. Still others guessed it was the hand of God, for Gold feeds us.\nThe teacher stopped at Douglas desk, bent down, and asked him whose hand it was. The little boy looked away and said, \" It's yours, teacher.\"\nShe recalled the times she had taken his hand and walked with him here and there. How often had she said, \"Take my hand, Douglas, we' ll go outside.\" or, \" Let me show you how to hold your pencil.\" Douglas was thankful for his teacher's hand. It means much to Douglas. He might not always say thanks, but he'll remember the hand that reaches out. She wiped her tears away and went on with her work."

      "Hello-Hello, a creative mobile language learning company, announced the launch of Hello-Hello World, a free application for the iPad that helps people learn a new language by connecting them with native speakers through social networking.\nThe application lets users complete language lessons and connect with Hello-Hello's global community of language learners with members in almost 100 countries to help each other in the learning process. \nHello-Hello World is available in 11 different languages and allows users to submit both oral and writing exercises for their friends and Hello-Hello's language experts to review. Users are also able to provide written feedback on their friend's exercises directly from their mobile devices.\n\"The most effective way to learn a new language is through total immersion  ,\"said Sarah Gontijo, founder and CEO of Hello-Hello. \"However, not everyone has the opportunity to live in another country. Hello-Hello World brings the convenience of connecting with native speakers anytime, from anywhere. This can help users not only learn the language but also understand the culture.\"\nHello-Hello World lets users synchronize   their information with the Hello-Hello Cloud and then access the content from any mobile device or computer. The application is first being released for the ipad and will become available on a variety of platforms, including the iPhone, Android and Blackberry.\nThe application arrives at a time when tablet   computing is driving the creation of new educational tools, such as Hell-Hello World. Many schools and colleges are finding ways to adapt mobile technology for classroom learning. \"The market is hot for such pioneering in education and social networking,\" said Gontijo. \"Hell-Hello promises to be the invention that will set the ball rolling and bring innovation to an industry that has seen little change over the years.\"\nTechnology research firm Gartner predicts that app-store downloads worldwide will double to $17.7 billion as the year closes, and that app-income will hit $15.1 billion, tripling the impact of last year's sales. App-downloads are expected to continue to jump to 185 billion by 2014, at which point worldwide tablet sales are projected to surpass   208 million units."

      "Science Daily (Apr. 27, 2008)-- Dutch ecologist Roxina Soler and her colleagues have discovered that subterranean   and aboveground herbivorous   insects can communicate with each other by using plants as telephones.  Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals through the leaves of the plant. This way, aboveground insects are warned that the plant is already \"occupied\".\n     Aboveground, leaf-eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root-eating insects. Subterranean insects send out chemical signals through the leaves of the plant, which warn the aboveground insects about their presence. This messaging makes it possible for spatially-separated insects to avoid each other, so that they do not compete for, the same plant.\n     In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean insects and 'vice versa  . It seems that a mechanism   has developed through natural selection,  which helps the subterranean and aboveground insects to communicate with each other. This avoids unnecessary competition.\n      Through the \"green telephone lines\", subterranean insects can also communicate with     _ , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars  . Parasitic wasps   lay their eggs inside aboveground insects. The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.\n     The communication between subterranean and above- ground insects has only been studied in a few systems. It is still not clear how widespread this phenomenon is, say the researchers."

      "The best selling children's book, Pipilu Sending You 100 Lives, has been adapted into a homonymous play that will be put on for the first time next March and tour around 50 cities in China.\nThe book was adapted by the Hangzhou based Star Dream Factory.\n\"We don't want to descend to the average children's dramas that are overly eager to please the kids,\" said Huang Qin, director of Star Dream Factory. \"We want to provide something practically useful and mystically entertaining.\"\nThe original book by Chinese children's book writer Zheng Yuanjie focuses on safety tips for kids. With Zheng's usual _ and simplicity, the book avoids sugar-coating reality. Instead, it illustrates the potential dangers in everyday life and provides possible solutions.\nZheng recalled that when he saw his new-born baby in the hospital, the first thought that hit him was to do his utmost to guarantee his son's safety.\n\"Safety is of the greatest importance to a human being,\" said Zheng. \"If the person is gone, nothing else will matter.\"\nAccording to Zheng, there is no preaching or soapboxing in his book. He said that he just wanted to talk and tell the plain truth to the children in an easily understandable way.\nThis line of thought will be echoed in the theatrical reproduction, said director Guo Yan. She also said that the play will place emphasis on multimedia effects and the interaction with the families.\n\"Theatre may not ensure the children a path to professional esteem and better jobs in society, but it does have the power to give them strength (at heart),\" said Huang Qin.\nHuang also calls for consistent attention to child safety, pointing out the lack of universal education and effective legal channels.\nThe show is expecting an estimated audience of more than 100,000 people during its domestic tour in the upcoming year."

      "Americans have contributed   to many art forms, and jazz, a type of music, is one of the art forms started in the United States. Black Americans, who sang and played the music of their homeland, created jazz.\nJazz is a mixture of the music of Africa, the work songs the slaves sang, and religious  music. Improvisation   is an important part of jazz. This is why a jazz song sounds a little different each time it is played.\nJazz bands formed in the late 1800s. They played in bars and clubs in many towns and cities of the South, especially New Orleans. New Orleans is an international seaport, and people from all over the world come to New Orleans to hear jazz.\nJazz became more and more popular. By the 1920s, jazz was popular all over the United States. By the 1940s, you could hear jazz not only in clubs and bars, but in concert halls as well. Today, people from all over the world play jazz. Jazz musicians from the United States, Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe meet and share their music at festivals on every continent. In this way, jazz continues to grow and change."

      "Researchers in the psychology department at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have discovered a major difference in the way men and women respond to stress. This difference may explain why men are more likely to suffer from stress-related disorders.\nUntil now, psychological research has maintained that both men and women have the same \"fight-or-flight\" reaction to stress. In other words, individuals either react with aggressive behavior, such as verbal or physical conflict (\"fight\"), or they react by withdrawing from the stressful situation (\"flight\"). However, the UCLA research team found that men and women have quite different biological and behavioral responses to stress. While men often react to stress in the fight-or-flight response, women often have another kind of reaction which could be called \"tend and befriend.\" That is, they often react to stressful conditions by protecting and nurturing their young (\"tend\"), and by looking for social contact and support from others - especially other females ('befriend\").\nScientists have long known that in the fight-or- flight reaction to stress, an important role is played by certain hormones  released by the body. The UCLA research team suggests that the female tend-or-befriend response is also based on a hormone. This hormone, called oxytocin, has been studied in the context of childbirth, but now it is being studied for its role in the response of both men and women to stress. The principal investigator, Dr. Shelley E. Taylor, explained that \"animals and people with high levels of oxytocin are calmer, more relaxed, more  social, and less anxious.\" While men also secrete oxytocin, its effects are reduced by male hormones.\nIn terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed. They may phone relatives or friends, or ask directions if they are lost.\nThe study also showed how fathers and mothers responded differently when they came home to their family after a stressful day at work. The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet. For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.\nThe differences in responding to stress may explain the fact that women have lower frequency of stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure or aggressive behavior. The tend-and-befriend regulatory  system may protect women against stress, and this may explain why women on average live longer than men."

      "With my hands and knees on the floor of the airplane, I was searching for an old lady's missing hearing aid during the flight from Sydney to Los Angeles. It occurred to me that this may not be the most dignified posture for a Buddhist nun .\nI had seen the old lady from the seat in front of me as she walked up and down the passage with a flashlight. I asked a few times what was wrong, but she didn't answer at first --- she couldn't hear me. She was wearing a woolen coat. Judging from her accent, she came from Eastern Europe.\nDo you know what hearing aids cost? Thousands, especially for the new tiny hidden-in-the-ear type she described. It takes a long time for an appointment to make a new one, and many doctor visits to get the thing adjusted right. Therefore, my dignity seemed less important than finding that hearing aid. But how does one find a tiny black object in a shadowy jet cabin ?\nThe lady wasn't even sure where or when she had lost it. At one point, a couple of flight attendants did a random search around the lady's seat; I wasn't impressed. They left suggesting that she search the seat of her previous flight! My flashlight turned up all kinds of small objects, bits of plastic, broken pieces of headphones.\nThe old lady said that she gave up. Yet I couldn't. After we landed, as passengers streamed past us, I insisted that the lady move aside while awaiting her wheelchair. Then I got into a real down and dirty search among the dust under her seat and on the floor.\nLook! A little peanut-sized shiny black object caught the light of my flashlight in a floor crack near her seat.\nWhat a rush. \"I found it!\"\nWith great astonishment and gratitude, the old lady responded, \"I haven't the words to express my thanks!\""

      "Shoplifting   is happening in stores or supermarkets throughout the world.

Now it seems it is a nation of shoplifters. According to the research,Britainis the most light-fingered country in Europe, with nearly one in every two cases of shoplifting across the continent taking place in British stores. The report said there were nearly 566,000 reported cases of shoplifting inBritainout of a Europe-wide total of 1.27 million.

      "The ancient whistled language of the small island of La Gomera, off the coast of Africa, is about to disappear because of new technology and globalization. Now, a web company has taken on the task of saving the language by marrying history with technology.\nSilbo Gomero, a language used only on La Gomera Island, sounds to the untrained ear like few other known languages. The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking.\nThe language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the  _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds   had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word.\nWith the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct.\nTo save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. \"We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, \" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.\n Niesner says one of the founding principles of the website was to promote learning languages in danger of extinction. \"If Busuu.com really works out like we think, it would be an amazing tool for language learning all over the world,\" Niesner said. \"The name of our website itself comes from Busuu, a language that is spoken by only eight people.\""

Thousands of years ago in Egypt, salt was used to preserve   the dead.\nStealing salt was considered a major crime   during some periods of history. In the eighteenth century, for example, if a person was caught stealing salt, he could be put in prison and his ears could be cut off.\nIn the Roman Empire, one of the most important roads was the one that carried salt from the salt mines to Rome. Guards were stationed along the route to protect against salt thieves, and they received their pay in salt, thus bringing the English word, salary. Any guard who fell asleep while on duty was thought to be \"not worth his salt\", and as a result he would get a little less salt on his next payday. The expression, \"not worth his salt\", is still used today in English.\nIn the modern world salt has many uses beyond the dining table. It is used in making glass and airplane parts, in the growing of crops, and in the killing of weeds  . It is also used to make water soft, to melt   ice on roads and highways, to make soap, and to fix colors in cloth.\nSalt can be got in various ways besides being taken from mines underground. Salt water from the ocean, salt water lakes or small seas can be used to make salt. Yet, no matter where it comes from, salt will continue to play an important role in the lives of people everywhere."

They are not speaking to each other. They haven't spoken to each other at the breakfast table for years. The husband is reading his newspaper. We can't see his face.

      "In my living room, there is a plaque   that advises me to \"Bloom   where you are planted.\" It reminds me of Dorothy. I got to know Dorothy in the early 1980s, when I was teaching Early Childhood Development through a program with Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky. The job responsibilities requested occasional visits to the classroom of each teacher in the program. Dorothy stands out in my memory as one who \"bloomed\" in her remote area.\n              Dorothy taught in a school In Harlan County, Kentucky, Appalachian Mountain area. To get to her school from the town of Harlan, I followed a road winding around the mountain. In the eight-mile journey, I crossed the same railroad track five times, giving the possibility of getting caught by the same train five times. Rather than feeling excited by this drive through the mountains, I found it depressing. The poverty level was shocking and the small shabby  houses gave me the greatest feeling of hopelessness.\n              From the moment of my arrival at the little school, all gloom   disappeared. Upon arriving at Dorothy's classroom. I was greeted with smiling faces and treated like a queen. The children had been prepared to show me their latest projects. Dorothy told me with a big smile that they were serving poke greens salad and cornbread for \"dinner\" (lunch). In case you don't know, poke greens are a weed-type plant that grows wild, especially on poor ground.\n              Dorothy never ran out of reports of exciting activities of her students. Her enthusiasm  never cooled down. When it came time to sit for the testing and interviewing required to receive her Child Development Associate Certification, Dorothy was ready. She came to the assessment and passed in all areas. Afterward, she invited me to the one-and-only steak house in the area to celebrate her victory, as if she had received her Ph. D. degree. After the meal, she placed a little box containing  an old pen in my hand. She said it was a family heirloom  , but to me it is a treasured symbol of appreciation and pride that cannot be matched with things.  (360 words)"

      "Women love shoes! They will sometimes go to look for the perfect pair of shoes to wear only once with the perfect outfit or the fashion of the day. Once worn, these fashionable designer shoes may spend weeks, months, or years in the closet without being worn again until another special occasion comes up. With that said, are expensive designer shoes really worth their cost?\nHistorically, shoes were invented to free feet from sharp rocks, hot sands, and blisters. Shoes were made to be simple and functional, with tough leather soles and straps. As society became more sophisticated  , the role of shoes changed; shoes were made to add status to the wearer.\nShoe designers began to work on the production of fashion shoes for the wealthy; shoes meant more for show than for practical use or simplicity. Good shoemakers became well known and printed symbols on their shoes, so people could recognize the maker of that particular design. Designer shoes were thus born.\nMany women develop serious problems with their feet after wearing these designer shoes during the workday and the medical costs for dealing with these problems can get very high. Some popular makers of designer shoes have been working towards combining comfort and practical use into their shoes, but it has been noted that women still go for style, beauty and uniqueness above everything else.\nSo to answer the question as to whether or not designer shoes are worth the cost, the answer is certainly yes, but be smart and invest in a pair of comfortable, not so stylish shoes for the days when you stay outdoors for hours! They can also be very expensive, but I can surely say that they are worth the cost."

      "I am a professor of sports and exercise so I often deal with nervousness in my research with sports people. Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable  and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen."

      "Are you the kind of person who likes staying in unusual places? If the answer is \"yes\", then try the world's coldest hotel in Jukkasjarvi in the north of Sweden. But go in winter to all you'll find is a pool of water, because the hotel melts every spring!\nThe man who runs the Artic Hall Hotel is Nils Yngve Bergqvist. He built his first ice building for an art exhibition in 1991 and he designed the present hotel-over 200 meters square-himself. It took workmen about two months to pile 1,000 tons of snow onto a wooden base. As the weather got colder, the snow froze and then they removed the base. The whole building and everything in it are made of snow-except for the wooden front door. There's a theatre which Nils uses for a jazz club, a radio station and a large ice bar. As you can imagine, hot drinks are popular with the guests! The rooms have no doors; there's no furniture, no heating and everyone sleeps on ice beds. But the 800 people who stayed at the hotel this winter seemed to like it. If you want to stay in one of he ten ice rooms, it will cost you about Y=30 a night. You will receive a survival certificate from the manager.\nWhen the winter's over, Nils holds his annual contest to predict the day that the hotel will fall. The person that guessed the day correctly last year received a large painting from an Artic Hall exhibition. Nils' ice hotel is becoming world famous and he loves his work. He's already excited about his next project-an ice hotel that will have more complicated architectural features and, he says, will be bigger and better."

      "As part of an effort to improve treatments for life-threatening illnesses, a team of scientists have created rabbits that glow in the dark.\nThe efforts have produced two rabbits out of a litter of eight that went from being a normal, soft white to glowing green in the dark. The rabbits were born at the University of Istanbul as part of the cooperation between scientists from universities in Turkey and Hawaii.\nThe rabbits glow to show that a genetic operation technique can work efficiently. \"The green is not important at all--it's just a marker to show the experiment can be done successfully,\" said University of Hawaii associate professor, Stefan Moisyadi.\nTo produce the glowing effect, researchers injected jellyfish DNA into a mother rabbit's embryos. Then those embryos were put into the mother. Similar experiments have resulted in glowing cockroaches  and cats.\nEventually, the researchers hope the technique can lead to new ways to produce medicines, Moisyadi said.\n\"The final goal is to develop animals that are able to produce beneficial molecules in their milk that can be cheaply extracted , especially in countries that cannot afford big factories that make drugs, which usually cost US$1bn to build. Then they will be able to produce their own protein-based medication in animals,\" Moisyadi said.\nThe rabbits are expected to live as long as non-glowing rabbits, but Moisyadi said he understands people can object to this kind of experimentation involving live animals. \"To the people against, I say: think, what are the benefits and what is the harm?\" Moisyadi said. \"And if the benefits outweigh the harm, let's go with the benefits.\"\nMoisyadi started developing the project in 2006, and researchers are now waiting to see if pregnant sheep produce similar results."

      "How will you celebrate New Year's Eve? By having a party with your classmates? Going to the karaoke for a singing competition? Many people around the world celebrate the day. Let's have a look at what people in other countries do.\n    In the United States, thousands of people jam into Times Square in New York to welcome in the new year at midnight. The change from New Year's Eve and New Year's Day is very exciting. People count down   the seconds to welcome the new day as the New Year ball slowly gets down and lights up the area.\n    In Spain, when the clock strikes midnight, everyone eats 12 grapes. They eat one grape for each toll   to bring good luck for the next 12 months of the new year.\n    In Scotland, fireworks are set off in front of the Edinburgh Castle. Immediately after midnight, people sing Auld Lang Syne (<<>> ). The words are in Scottish and mean \"days gone by\". The famous Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote the song.\n    In Brazil, most people wear white clothes on New Year's Eve to bring good luck for the new year. If they live near a beach, after midnight, people go there, light candles in the sand, throw flowers in the sea and make a wish. They say that the goddess who protects the sea will make their wishes come true.\n    Did you know?\n    The date January 1 was picked by the Roman leader Julius Caesar   as the change of the year when he established his own calendar in 46 BC. The month of January was named after the Roman god, Janus. He is pictured with two heads. One head looks forward and the other back. They represent a break between the old and new."

      "A new report says the number of foreign students at colleges and universities in the United States increased by three percent last year. This has been the first obvious increase since 2001.\nAmerican schools last fall had 583,000 foreign students. The record is 586,000. That was set in 2002 after many years of gains. But after that the numbers fell. The terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001 led to more visa   requirements. Now stronger efforts are being made to get more foreign students to study in the United States.\nChina remained in second place in front of South Korea but behind India, whichsent almost 84,000 students last fall. The number of Japanese fell sharply by nine percent, although it remained in fourth place.\nThere were three percent drops from Indonesia and Kenya, the only African country in the top twenty last year. But there were obvious increases from Saudi Arabia, Nepal and Vietnam. The number of Saudi students more than doubled, rising to nearly eight thousand.\nFor a sixth year, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles had the most foreign students. Columbia University in New York was second. Other schools in the top five were New York University, the University of Illinois and Purdue University.\nUnlike American students in other countries, who often choose history and language study, the leading area of study in the USA was business and management. Second was engineering.\nThe new report also says more than 220,000 Americans studied in other countries. That was during the 2005-2006 school year. It was a record number, and an increase of eight and a half percent from the year before. But only five percent of them stayed for a full year."

It's called being homesick.\nHomesick means you're upset, sad, and maybe scared. But don't feel surprised. A lot of people get homesick, even grownups. When you're used to having certain people and things around you, it can be scary when they're gone. When you're dealing with other problems, you will feel homesick, too. Some kids may feel more homesick than usual if their parents are getting divorced or if someone they loved has recently died.\nHere are some ideas to help you feel less homesick.\nBring a little bit of home with you. If you're going away from home, bring your pillow or pictures of the people you'll be apart from and look at them any time you want.\nKeep busy.

      "When you were a child you had a pure mind which was free from worries and anxieties. However, as time goes by, you're faced with so many problems in life. Below are five techniques that can help you get relaxed.\n1. Mind your own business.\nYes, please mind your own business. When you start being concerned about things which are not related to you, you lose your control on your thought process, which often has negative results disturbing the mental peace. Basically, your mind starts wandering here and there. So next time an unnecessary thought comes to your mind, think whether this is really something you should be worrying for? If not, keep it away and focus on something positive, practical and fruitful.\n2. Surround yourself with positive people.\n _ negative comments and stay away from negative souls. When someone is negative, he spreads negativity and you get affected. Staying with such people will have long term influence on your character so think about your company.\n3. Don't think about others too much.\nRemember: _ Don't allow your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult   to yourself. Don't be jealous; it's a heart killing disease, get rid of it as soon as possible. When you are jealous you focus on finding faults in others even if they don't have. This poisons your soul and steals the mental peace.\n4. You can't keep everyone happy.\nDon't be oversensitive  . Be natural in what you do. Be positive and constructive in your deeds and then don't really care too much about others. Be aware, don't apply this to too closed relations. Develop trust to build up powerful relationships.\n5. Don't believe yourself to be unlucky.\nRemember this: Bad luck happens to everyone. It's not your fault at all. Time, whether good or bad, passes quickly. Develop the power of not looking back into your past. Believe in the power of Now. Believe in your skills. Work hard and you will get what you have been entitled for. Be patient and see what has been planned for you.\nWith these recommendations, I believe if you can make it, it's probable that you can bring changes in your lifestyle and get back your mental peace."

You can't be positive all the time. How do you do it?\" Michael replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself 'Mike, you have two choices today.

Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead'.\"\nMichael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude."

      "If you want to live longer and lower the risk of heart disease, a move to the mountains may help. Research by scientists in Greece shows that living in the mountains is good for the heart and longevity . People living at higher altitude  have lower possibility of dying from heart disease than those closer to sea level, even if they have factors that could increase their risk. \"Residence in mountainous areas seems to have a 'protective effect' from heart disease,\" said Dr Nikos Baibas of the University of Athens. He and his colleagues suspect that the increased exercise from walking up mountainous area gives the heart a good workout and enables it to cope with lower levels of oxygen.\nResearchers studied the health records and death rates of 1,150 Greeks who lived in three villages near Athens over 15 years. One village was 1,000 meters above sea level and the other two were in low-lying areas. Although men and women living in the mountainous village had higher blood pressure rates and other risk factors than people in the other villages, they had a lower rate of death from heart disease and other causes after a fifteen year follow-up.\" The contrast was more evident among men than among women,\" Baibas added in a report in theJournal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Heart disease is one of the world's top killers. Smoking, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol levels, being overweight and a family history of the illness increase the possibility of developing the disease."

      "To me, life without music would not be exciting. I realize that this is not true for everybody. Many people get along quite well without going to the concert, and listening to the record. But music plays an important part in everyone's life, whether he realizes it or not. Try to imagine, for example, what films or TV plays would be like without music. Would the feelings, the moving plot, and the greatest interests, be so exciting or dramatic? I'm not sure about it.\nNow, we have been speaking of music in its more common meaning----the kind of music we hear in the concert hall. But if we look at some parts of music more closely, we discover them in our everyday life too----in the rhythm of the sea, the _ of a bird in the woods and so on. So music surely has meaning for everyone, in some way or other. And, of course, it has special meaning for those who have spent all their lives working on playing or writing music.\nIt is well said, \"Through music a child enters into a world of beauty, expresses himself from his heart, feels the joy of doing things alone, learns to take care of others, develops his mind and makes his body strong.\""

      "Dave Bruno works as an online marketing manager. Several years ago, one weekend Bruno and his family did a major house cleanup and then donated several bags of unneeded items to the local Goodwill store. \"After all were done, I looked around and realized that I still had too much stuff\", says Bruno, \" _ \" That realization prompted the 39-year-old father of three to try an experiment, \"The 100Thing Challenge\".\nWith the goal of breaking free of what he calls a \"bad habit of consumerism , Bruno was determined to live for one year with just 100 personal items. He cut down his possessions to 94 items, including a Bible, laptop, guitar, wedding ring, car and clothes. He created some guidelines for the experiment since his wife and daughters did not participate, familyshared and household items did not count as personal items. He also grouped together some basic things such as underwear and socks. Bruno began blogging about his new lifestyle and eventually wrote a book, The 100 Thing Challenge: How I Got Rid of Almost Everything, Remade My Life, and Regained My Soul.\nSince completing the experiment, Bruno has continued to live by the motto: reduce, refuse, and rearrange and maintains just 110 personal things. \" Nearly three years of living with a minimal amount of personal possessions, I'm no longer in the habit of consuming for the sake of consumption  ,\" he wrote in his blog last week, \"That has freed me up for all sorts of better endeavors   than shopping--like spending time with family and writing a book and planning for business opportunities.\"\nBruno's project has also inspired others to live minimally, many of whom post their own 100 Thing Challenge updates on YouTube. \"The reality is that the 100 Thing Challenge is surprisinglyeasy\", says Bruno, \"I'm  not saying there were no challenges or disappointments. I miss some things, but not that much. Frankly, it's far easier to live with less stuff than with excessive trash.\""

      "You may think that light pollution isn't something extraordinarily important. You may believe that every other type of pollution has a larger impact on the environment than light pollution does. But light pollution is serious.\nLight pollution, or \"sky glow\", is the glow  you can see at night above cities and towns. Light pollution is a problem that has been accompanying man ever since he started his first fire some 15,000 years ago. Light pollution is the light  that comes from streetlights, buildings, parking lots and any other source of light that is reflected or directed into the atmosphere.\nUrban light pollution means that one-fifth of the world's population can no longer see the Milky Way  with the naked eye . Many city kids, even if they did look through the orange smog above their heads, would probably see only a handful of stars. We have lost our view of the stars, and we have _ our  night-time environment as well. Astronomers are calling for the dark places on Earth to be preserved as national parks.\nLots of people find the ever-brightening night annoying, and animals that are programmed to prefer the dark may avoid a brightened habitat. Sea turtles can get lost searching for a beach to lay eggs, and their hatchlings may confuse over-lit beachfront resorts  for the ocean horizon, wasting precious energy needed to find the sea and escape predators . Because their necks aren't yet long enough to see things far away, baby turtles rely on the mirror image of the moon to guide them to the sea, to begin their new life. A car may even hit a particular turtle, which was thinking the light from a nearby city was moonlight reflecting off the ocean waves. Birds that live in and around cities can die because of sky glow, too. The bright lights can blind them, leading to countless collisions with buildings and other tall structures.\nReducing light pollution is not difficult.Light pollution is the easiest type of pollution to end. people can help reduce much sky glow by using lighting only when necessary. The stars above us are priceless heritage-- for not only for astronomers but for all humans. More of our children should be able to look up at night and see the Milk Way is not just a candy bar."

      "The Haitian tsunami gave scientists a chance to find out how well vital and potentially life-saving warning systems were working.\nNoaa's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has developed a warning system that picks up signals of tsunamis directly from the sea-floor.\nIt is called Dart-the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis. If seismometers  detect an earthquake, the Dart buoys  will determine what is happening to sea levels, and whether a big wave might be on the way. This information is then sent via satellite to a central location which can organize an alarm. Within 50 minutes of the Haiti earthquake, this system was able to issue an alarm to other countries in the Caribbean to say that a small tsunami had been caused to start, and that was unlikely to affect them.\nDr Bernard said, \"The first 30 minutes following the earthquake, we have to rely on education.\" The critical aspects of this are: do you feel the earthquake; do you see the ocean draw down; and do you hear that loud roar? If so, you should run for higher ground.\n\"But after the first few minutes, it's crucial that we have the technology--the measurements to avoid unnecessary evacuation and tell people when it is safe to return.\" Right now, there are 50 of these Dart buoys all over the globe--four of which are in the Caribbean.\nDr Bernard says that, with 75 to 100 buoys worldwide, this system could provide global tsunami warnings within one hour.\n\"That's for everywhere we know that tsunamis have happened. If we wanted to go to half an hour detection, we could probably double or multiply by four times that number,\" he said.\n\"In some countries, including Haiti, there may not be enough resources to support a specific tsunami warning centre for something that happens so infrequently.\"\nHe said that this system was relatively inexpensive to fix and operate.\n\"To get it down to an hour for everywhere affected would cost $50m initial investment and then 10% of that to maintain it,\" he said.\n\"That's not a terribly expensive system considering the potential savings of lives.\""

      "\"Mama, when I grow up, I'm going to be one of those!\" I said this after seeing the Capital Dancing Company perform when I was three. It was the first time that my dream took on a vivid form and acted as something important to start my training. As I grew older and was exposed to more, my interests in the world of dance certainly varied but that little girl's dream of someday becoming a dancer in the company never left me. In the summer of 2005 when I was 18, I received the phone call which made that dream a reality: I became a member of the company dating back to 1925.\nAs I look back on that day now, it surely lacks any sense of reality. I believe I stayed in a state of pleasant disbelief until I was halfway through rehearsals   on my first day. I never actually expect to get the job. After being offered the position, I was completely astonished. I remember shaking with excitement.\n _ . Through the strict rehearsal period of dancing six days a week, I found it vital to pick up the material fast with every last bit of concentration. It is that extreme attention to detail   and stress on practice that set us apart. To then follow those high-energy rehearsals with a busy show schedule of up to five performances a day, I discovered a new meaning of the words \"hard work.\" What I thought were my physical boundaries were pushed much further than I thought possible. I learned to make each performance better than the last.\nToday, when I look at the unbelievable company that I have the great honor of being a part of, not only as a member, but as a dance captain, I see a tradition that has inspired not only generations of little girls but a splendid company that continues to develop and grow-and inspires people every day to follow their dreams."

      "If you are ever planning to buy a telescope and want to get yourself involved in astronomy it is always a good idea to know a bit of the sky.Get acquainted with a few constellations  so that it will be easier for you to spot the constellations when you are using your telescope.\nIt's a good idea to buy a few magazines on astronomy to help you to get familiar with the constellations in the sky and also read a few reviews on the different types of telescopes in the market.This will help you gather all the information that is out there regarding telescopes and what people have to say about them.\nIt's advisable to go in for a pair of binoculars  before you buy your first telescope so that you can get used to spotting constellations before your view of the sky is narrowed down.This will also help you know if you really want to get involved in astronomy.Many people buy a costly telescope and then discover that they're not actually interested in astronomy.\nExperience has no substitute,and there certainly is nothing better than using different telescopes before you buy one.This will help you to get the feel of all the types of telescopes and you will know which one is easier for you to use.A large aperture  refractor  may give you an excellent image but you may not be able to keep a steady hand while using it resulting in a blurry image.\nThere are three types of telescopes that are available in the market.If you want a more elegant looking telescope you can always choose to buy a fine brass telescope.It's good to become acquainted with each type before going for the plunge of a first telescope.The first type of telescope is the refractor telescope,which uses lenses to gather light to a focus at the eye piece.The use of lenses helps the telescope have a superior image.A refracting telescope is not as portable as the other two types of telescopes and so you will have to buy one with a small aperture.\nThe second type of telescope is the Reflector.Made by Sir Isaac Newton,this telescope functions by focusing the light back at the front of the tube,which is where the eyepiece sits,by using parabolic  mirrors and another smaller mirror to deflect the light.There is no added color in the image caused by refraction of light since this telescope does not use lenses.These are the cheapest of all telescopes and are more portable than refractors."

      "BEIJING--Seven prestigious universities in China announced Sunday that they would begin using the same independent exam --besides the national one --to test students hoping to gain entrance to them in 2011.\nThe seven are Peking University, Beihang University, Beijing Normal University, Nankai University, Fudan University, Xiamen University and Hong Kong University.\nStudents who want to gain entrance to any of the seven universities will only have to sit one independent exam, according to the joint announcement.\n\"This will help lighten the students' load, otherwise they must take several exams for different universities ,\"said the announcement.\nPassing the exam could result in more than one interview chance, giving the students more opportunities to choose their favorite universities.\nChina' s college entrance exam system is undergoing reform as universities aim to select students based on independent criteria rather than just using the results of the national exam.\nIn 2003, Peking University and another 21 universities were allowed to pilot   the reform by using their own criteria to independently select five percent of their students.\nNow nearly 80 universities across the country have the right to select talented students based on their own exams.\nEducation experts regard universities selecting students according to independent examinations as conducive   to better understanding where the students' talents lie.\nAlthough this may be the case, it has also created problems as students may sit many different exams as they often apply for a number of universities.\nTo relieve students from such pressures, the national education outline (2010--2020) released in July this year encourages high-level universities to group together to use the same exams."

      "Wild animals seem to have escaped the Indian Ocean tsunami , adding weight to ideas they possess a \"sixth sense\" for disasters, experts said on Thursday.\nSri Lanka wildlife officials have said the giant waves that killed over 24,000 people along the Indian Ocean island's coast seemingly missed wild beasts, with no dead animals found.\n\"No elephants are dead, not even a dead hare or rabbit. I think animals can sense disaster. They have a sixth sense. They know when things are happening,\" H.D. Ratnayake, deputy director of Sri Lanka's Wildlife Department, said on Wednesday.\nThe waves washed floodwaters up to 3 km (2 miles) inland at Yala National Park in the southeast, Sri Lanka's biggest wildlife reserve and home to hundreds of wild elephants. \"There has been a lot of evidence about dogs barking or birds migrating before volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. But it has not been proven,\" said Matthew van Lierop, an animal behaviour specialist at Johannesburg Zoo.\n\"There have been no specific studies because you can't really test it in a lab or field setting,\" he said.\nOther authorities agreed with this conclusion.\n\"Wildlife seem to be able to pick up certain phenomenon, especially birds. There are many reports of birds detecting coming disasters,\" said Clive Walker, who has written several books on African wildlife.\nAnimals certainly rely on the known senses such as smell or hearing to avoid danger such as predators .\nThe idea of an animal \"sixth sense\" is a lasting one that the evidence on Sri Lanka's damaged coast is likely to add to."

      "Elephants scored a big win in Dohar, Qatar, on March 22, 2010. Representatives from 175 countries met in the Middle Eastem country. They voted to continue a ban on the sale of ivory  . Two African nations, Tanzania and Zambia, had asked to open up the ivory trade.\nPeople feared that weakening a 21-year-old ban on the sale of ivory would encourage illegal hunting and hurt elephant populations. African elephants once numbered in the millions. Today, there are fewer than 500,000.\n\"People born in 100 years should be able to see an elephant,\" said Noah Wekesa, Kenya's minister of forest and wildlife. His country voted to keep the ban.\nIn the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants were killed throughout Africa. Hunters killed the animals for their ivory tusks, which were used to make jewelry and other things. \"The  _ of elephants in Africa was terrible,\" says Paul Todd of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The group works to protect animals.\nThe ivory wars continued until 1989, when the United Nations voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade controlled, demand for ivory fell. Governments punished hunters. Elephant populations began slowly to increase.\nTanzania and Zambia asked to allow ivory sales from government stockpiles  . Ivory is so expensive that it's known as \"white gold\". Tanzania holds almost 200,000 pounds of ivory, which is worth as much as $20 million. Zambia has 48,000 pounds of the white gold. The countries said they need the money the ivory would bring. They say it was taken from hunters or came from animals that died naturally.\nExperts believe that trading ivory encourages illegal hunting. They felt happy about the decision which forbids the sales. \"This is a rare victory for elephants,\" said Jason Bell. He works to protect animals."

      "Silk production has a long and colourful history unknown to most people. Scientific discoveries have shown that silk production existed in China from around 2500 B.C., although it could be much older. For hundreds of years, China kept the secret of silk to itself as one for the most closely protected secrets in history. Anyone revealing the secret of silkworms or trying to take silkworm eggs out of ancient China was punished by death.\nAt one time silk was reserved only for the Chinese emperor. Gradually, others began wearing silk. In addition to being used for clothing, silk came to have industrial uses in ancient China, something that happened in the West only in modern times. Silk was used to make musical instruments, fishing lines, weapons, ropes and even paper. During the Han Dynasty silk became a form of money. Farmers paid taxes in both rice and silk. The prices of goods were calculated in lengths of silk just as they had once been calculated in gold. The importance of silk is even reflected in the Chinese language. For example, of the 5000 most common Chinese characters, around 500 have silk as their \"key\".\nIn spite of their secrecy, the Chinese eventually lost their monopoly on silk production. It reached Korea in around 200 B.C. when immigrants from China arrived there. Silk production came to India in 300 A.D.. It was not until 500 A.D. that silk production came to Europe when travellers _ silkworms in hollow tubes of bamboo. These were used to establish silk industry in Rome (modern-day Italy), although Chinese silk was still considered to be the best.\nSilk was brought to Rome from China by means of the Silk Road. There were actually two Silk Roads, one over land and one on the sea. The land route in particular had a huge effect in history. All sorts of trade goods -- silver, gold, jade, porcelain -- passed along this road. Ideas travelled the Silk Road too. For example the religion of Buddhism was carried to China from India by traders on the Silk Road. The Silk Road created the first international culture, exposing many people to the ideas and treasures of both Western and Chinese cultures."

Four years have passed and she has been almost every corner of Tibet.\nLi came to Tibet firstly because of her desire for personal freedom. She entered Tibet along the Yunnan-Tibetan road, enjoying the special view happily. She was surprised to find that it is a white paradise  on earth. Although she couldn't even speak a word of Tibetan language, she had no difficulty in communicating with natives. \"To me, they are free, generous, simple and happy. It appears to me that people should live in this way, singing while working, dancing while living.\" Li said. \nLi Wan's dream is to live in Tibet for a long time.

On many situations she travelled alone in some places in terrible climate. To her greatest surprise, she learned to value life and to follow her own heart.\n\"I felt very close to death many times when I was in extreme coldness and quietness, running out of energy. After having survived the difficulties, I find more beauty in my life. I have learned to insist on my dream,\" she said."

      "Jogging has become the most popular individual sport in America. Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability. A wise investment in good shoes will prevent blisters and the foot,ankle and knee injuries and will also enable the wearer to run on paved or soft surfaces. No other special equipment is needed; you can jog in any clothing you desire,even your street clothes.\nIt takes surprisingly little time to develop the ability to run. The American Jogging Association has a twelve-week program designed to move from a fifteen- minute walk (which almost anyone can manage who is in reasonable health) to a thirty-minute run. A measure of common sense,a physical examination,and a planned schedule are all it takes."

As a result, people spend much time outdoors. They go to the beach, to the countryside, or play sports outdoors in fields. \nTake Melbourne for example. The city features many open green spaces and beautiful long beaches. Melburnians \n(people from Melbourne) have a strong love for sports. The city hosts the annual Australia Open, \nthe Formula One Grand Prix, cricket, rugby and homegrown football. It is also home to museums, art exhibitions and drama festivals.\nThe comfortable environment has encouraged many people to migrate  to the country and Australia is known for being very multicultural or its cultural diversity .\n\"We have tried to introduce a sense of belonging in Australia,\" said Chris Bowen, the Australian Minister for Immigration . \"Multiculturalism is about inviting every individual member of society to be everything they can be ... to develop as individuals.\"\nThis could be the reason behind another Australia quality that Guardian reporter Stephen Brook has noticed: Australians do patriotism  much better than the Brits.\n\"I once witnessed two Australian viewers at a tennis tournament show more support for the Aussie player than the rest of the British arena,\" he wrote.\nIt is also an Australian tradition to stand up for the  _ . In the 2000 Olympic Games, the Sydney public watches an African swimmer who was barely able to swim 50 meters. Even though most people in the stands knew that even they could have swum better than him at that point, they cheered his every stroke  as if he were on his way to a good medal. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the level of support they showed for the Japanese team surprised viewers since Japan had little hope of winning. \n\"Australians don't need to be victorious in order to feel like a worthy person. When they cheer for the underdog, seeing other human beings having the courage to take on hardship, they get the emotional satisfaction they need,\" wrote a blogger on convictcreations.com, a website dedicated to Australian culture."

      "Eighteen-year-old Dana Kiger is happily running after balls on the soccer field. But not long ago, she couldn't remember her love of the game, her parents' faces or even her name.\nAt 16, the Tennessee honor student and star athlete was hit from behind while playing in a soccer game. She fell to the ground, her head striking the hard ground. The blow knocked out nearly all of Kiger's memories.\nWith no physical  injury or unusual change in her brain, doctors thought Kiger's memory would return in a few days. But it did not. And two and a half years later, it still hasn't. Kiger--who has no memory of her family, her childhood or her life before her injury--has had to create new memories, restart relationships and relearn old skills.\n\"The only thing I had ...I could walk, write, but I didn't know what to write,\" Kiger said of the days after the accident. \"Physically, I was OK, I guess, but mentally  I was troubled.\" Doctors say long-term amnesia  brought on by a less severe brain injury like Kiger's is unusual. \"It's very rare for people to have this lasting problem with memory recovering,\" said Dr Roger Hartl at Weill Cornell Medical College.\nKiger's parents tried to help their daughter return to the life she once lived. \"She didn't know what food was,\" Kiger's mom said. \"She said, 'What is that?' I said, 'Lettuce.\" She said, 'Do I like it?' I said, 'That's up to you to decide.'\"\nKiger's natural ability on the soccer field was the one part of her earlier life that died immediately. And soon, she'll begin a new life at Slippery Rock University, where she plans to study physical therapy . Kiger said that while parts of her past still remain a mystery, she's focused  on what's to come. \"It is about my future,\" she said."

      "Most people who live in Seattle, Washington, love their city. There is a never-ending flow of fun things to do. But, people who live there do not always enjoy the day-after-day absence of sunshine during the winter months.\nIt is documented fact that sunshine (or lack of it) plays a major role in how each of us meets the day. It also affects how we perform at school or work. When people are derived of sunlight, they can develop seasonal affective disorder, which makes it difficult for them to feel happy or get things accomplished. No major city in the United States is more affected by the \"sunshine factor\" than Seattle.\nTo fight drizzle and fog during the winter months, Steve Murphy created a business that is very popular among the locals. The Indoor Sun Shoppe is more than a little ray of sunshine during the gray days of Seattle's winter. His shop offers a huge source of plants and artificial lighting for people who are trying to overcome seasonal affective disorder.\nLocated in Fremont, Washington, The Indoor Sun Shoppe has an amazing collection of exotic plants and \"good bugs\" in a humid and well-lit environment. At The Indoor Sun Shoppe, you can spend up to $400 for artificial lighting that will chase away the winter blues. It will also keep your plants healthy. You can buy a dawn simulator that will gradually fill your room with a warming wake-up glow. What better way to meet a Seattle morning when real sunshine is nothing more than a happy thought!\nMurphy's in-home waterfalls are also popular with customers. But his plants and lights remain the \"main course.\" On a cloudy winter day, The Indoor Sun Shoppe is a bright spot in Seattle!"

      "We experience different forms of the Sun's energy every day. We can see its light and feel its warmth. The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth.\nMuch of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.\nMany gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air."

      "With a good shopping position and the right amount of money , any educated person ought to be able to make a living out of a bookshop . It is not a difficult trade to learn and the large chain-stores can never force the small bookseller out of existence as they have done to the corner shop . But the hours of work are very long-I was only doing a part-time job , but my boss put in a seventy-hour week ,besides regular journeys out of shopping hours to buy books . \n              The real reason why I should not like to be back in the book trade for life , however , is that while I was in it, I lost my love of books . A bookseller cannot always tell the truth about his books , and that gives him a dislike for them . There was a time when I really did love books--loved the sight and smell and feel of them--if they were fifty or more years old , that is . Nothing pleased me quite so much as to buy a bargain lot of them on sale for several pounds . There is a peculiar flavour about the unexpected books you pick up in that kind of collection: little-known eighteenth-century poets , or out-of-date geography books . For occasional reading--in your bath , for example , or late at night when you are too tired to go to bed--there is nothing as good as a very old picture story-book . \n              But as soon as I went to work in the bookshop, I stopped buying books . Seen in a mass, five or ten thousand at a time , books were dull and even a little tiresome .

      "Three-point-four billion riders on New York City subways and buses a year. This amazing number equals one-third of all mass transit trips in the United States. Ridership is at its highest in almost 60 years in almost every American city.\nA commuter advocacy group, \"Straphangers Campaign,\" attributes it to younger Americans, said Gene Russianoff.\n\"Millenials , those people born around the turn of the past century are much less car-oriented,\" he said. \"They are urban. They like not owning cars, they like less responsibility and there are a lot of them.\"\nIn addition to millenials, many people believe public transit is economical and eco-friendly. In 2012 across America, people took 10.7 billion trips.\n\"When we talk about insurance rates going up, price of automobiles going up, then people are waking up and realizing: wait, here's this huge asset that has been _ ,\" said Richard Rudolph, chairman of the Rail Users Network. \"Why not take advantage of this particular opportunity. It certainly makes more sense to get people out of automobiles into subways and into commuter and passenger railroads.\"\n _ -- as passenger demand requires several major expansion projects. A new $4.5 billion subway line on New York's Second Avenue -- which was recently excavated underneath businesses and apartment houses -- will take an overload of passengers off of other subway lines. Its first phase completion is scheduled in 2016.\nPeople who work in New York's financial district will soon be using a new transit subway transfer center. Almost all lines converge in lower Manhattan and the new center will give riders an easier way to get around the city and into New Jersey.\nAnd, probably the most controversial and costly project is a $7 billion tunnel connection from Long Island into Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal. Trains from there will have access to New York's midtown business district.\nAndrew Albert, a board member of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said there were many other reasons the public was riding in increasing numbers.\n\"The system has gotten a lot more dependable. We have new cars. We have countdown clocks to tell you when the next train is coming. We have expanded facilities in places,\" he said.\nNew York's 24-hour, 7-day-a-week, transit system costs a $1.5 billion a year to maintain. It is one of the world's oldest, with its first subway line having opened in 1904."

      "Why texting harms your IQ\nThe regular use of text messages and e-mails can lower the IQ more than twice as much as smoking marijuana  . That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do. Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand. The report also added that, in a long term, the brain will be considerably shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. At a microcellular level, the complex networks of nerve cells that make up parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences.\nToo much use of modern technology can be damaging not only to a person's mind, but to their social relationship. 1100 adults were interviewed during the research. More than 62 per cent of them admitted that they were addicted to checking their e-mails and text messages so often that they _ work-related ones even when at home or on holiday. Half said that they always responded immediately to an email and will even interrupt a meeting to do so. It is concluded that infomania is increasing stress and anxiety and affecting one's characteristics. Nine out of ten thought that colleagues who answered e-mails or messages during a face-to-face meeting were extremely rude.\nThe effects on IQ were studied by Dr Glenn Wilson, a psychologist at University of London. \"This is a very real and widespread phenomenon,\" he said. \"We have found that infomania will damage a worker's performance by reducing their mental sharpness and changing their social life. Companies should encourage a more balanced and appropriate way of working.\""

      "Supermarket Morrisons today announced to launch an online shopping operation within two years in a move to catch up with its web-savvy rivals. The UK's fourth biggest supermarket said Morrisons.com would offer grocery and non-food products but would take time to build from zero.\nAs part of its online development, Morrisons - the only one of the \"Big Four\" grocers to have a significant internet business - revealed it had invested PS32 million in a 10% stake of a New York-based online grocer. The announcement came as Morrisons posted a 13% increase in underlying pre-tax profits of PS869 million in the year to January 30.\nMorrisons is implementing a growth strategy which is focused on expanding its e-commerce business and moving into the convenience store market. It has earmarked PS3 billion in investment over the next three years. The supermarket floated the idea of launching its own website last year and today is the first firm commitment to realising that goal.\nLast month, the company took its first major step to launching an online operation with the acquisition of internet retailer Kiddicare for PS70 million. The company said this move, along with the 10% \"strategic\" stake in American online grocer FreshDirect announced today, would help it launch its own website in the future. FreshDirect was launched in 2002 and serves 600,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The deal will see Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips join the company's board.\nMorrisons also revealed it would open three convenience stores, around 3,000 sq ft in size, in July under the name M Local. The shops will be located in Morrisons' heartland in the north of England, in neighbourhoods around the M62 motorway. The company said the convenience business was the second-fastest growing part of the market. Rival models include Tesco Metro and Sainsburys Local."

      "\"To be or not to be.\" Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly, or to live dully and meanly. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: \"I think, therefore I am.\"\nBut the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: \"To be is to be in relations.\" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity  of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But other than our regular occupation, how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned --- poetry and prose , music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs ---you are dead.\nOn the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest --- even more, a new accomplishment  --- you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy. The real _ is the person who has lost interest.\nBacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too. Where your thoughts are, there will be your life too. If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live a narrow restricted(, ) life. But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.\nTo be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live!"

      "A month after Hurricane Katrina, I returned home in New Orleans. There lay my house, reduced towaist-high ruins, smelly and dirty.\nBefore the trip, I'd had my car fixed. When the office employee of the garage was writing up the bill,she noticed my Louisiana license plate. \"You from New Orleans?\"she asked I said I was, \"No charge.\"She said, and firmly shook her head when I reached for my wallet. The next day I went for a haircut, and the same thing happened.\nAs my wife was studying in Florida, we decided to move there and tried to find a rental house that we could afford while also paying off a mortgage (> on our mined house. We looked at many places, but none was satisfactory. We'd began to accept that we*d have to live in extremely reduced circumstances for a while, when I got a very curious e-mail from a James Kemmedy in California. He'd read some pieces I'd written about our sufferings for State, the online magazine  and wanted to give us (\"\"no conditions attached')a new house across thelake from New Orleans.\nIt sounded too good to be true, but I replied, thanking him for his exceptional generosity, that we had no plan to go back. Then a poet at the University of Florida offered to let his house to me, while he went to England on his one-year paid leave. The rent was rather reasonable. I mentioned the poet's offer to James Kemdedy, and the next day he sent a check covering our entire rent for eight months.\nThroughout this painful experience, the kindness of strangers has done much to bring back my faith in humanity. It's almost worth losing your worldly possessions to be reminded that people are really nice when given half a chance."

      "The United States government has decided that food from cloned  cattle, pigs and goats is safe to eat. The Food and Drug Administration also says it found no risks in meat and milk from cloned animals.\nThe F.D.A. looked at studies for several years before it announced its decision in a final report this month. The United States Department of Agriculture supported the findings. But it says time is needed to clear the way for marketing meat and milk from clones.\nThe F.D.A. will not require any product to be registered  as coming from clones. A producer would need to label   a product \"clone-free\". The agency   says that could be misunderstood because the food is not different from other food.\nBut activists argue that the F.D.A. based its decision on incomplete research into possible risks. The Center for Food Safety criticized the use of studies supplied by cloning companies. Animal rights activists point out that cloning attempts often fail. They say cloning is cruel and can lead to suffering.\nCongress   has been trying to get the F.D.A. to do more studies. But the agency noted that experts in New Zealand and the European Union had come to the same findings about the safety of food from clones. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan say they want to study it further before taking action.\nProducts from cloning may not be widely used for several years. Clones cost much , which is why they are not widely used for feeding. The Agriculture Department says few clones will ever become food. Their traditionally raised animals would enter the food supply instead."

      "School is out for the summer in some areas, and for many children, that means weeks of sleeping in late, trips to the swimming pool or hours spent in front of the TV. These months of inactivity--- away from the daily tiring things of school--- are something that young people look forward to, but it can have a detrimental influence on the knowledge they have.\nStudies have shown that children lose a lot in math skills during the summer months. Children who spend little time learning experience a much greater amount of learning loss than those who often take part in summer programs.\nSo when school starts again in the fall, teachers often have to spend several weeks reteaching children material that they have forgotten.\nExperts suggest that parents make sure the summer months are a time of continued learning. For example, they suggest that lunch time is good time to improve a child's spoken skills, simply through conversation. A trip to the supermarket can be an opportunity to improve a child's math skills by having him or her add up the cost of food. And there is no better way to prevent learning loss than by having a child read every day.\nFortunately, there are many programs that can help parents. The best place to start is at your local library. Most libraries have summer reading programs that are filled with fun activities. A. strong musical education also improves learning. Find out summer music camps in your area.\nWe think that children should have fun during the summer break, but it should not be a vacation from learning. We strongly suggest parents should take advantage of the many educational opportunities available for their children during the coming weeks."

      "When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com.\nFacemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss.\nLife Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michel Jordan greeted you by name, waited on you and personally closed the sale? And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge. Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school, she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat. Facemail could get hot fast. Personally, I'm a fan. But Facemail should be used with care. The clown looks lively and funny at first. But if you select the clown, put a few rude words in an e-mail and add some angry emotions, you're got Psycho-mail ."

      "They may be small and not able to speak, but babies are proving their amazing cleverness. Scientists began finding infants' skills are more than they are supposed to be.\n _ \nSpeaking of music, babies can't seem to resist it. Not only are their ears turned to the beats, babies can actually dance to the music.\nTo test babies' dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music, rhythmic beats and speech to infants, and recorded the results. They also invited professional dancers to analyze how well the babies matched their movements to the music. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs feet and heads in response to the music, much more than to the speech. The finding suggests this dancing ability is innate  in humans, though the researchers aren't sure why _ becomes weaker later in their life.\nLearning Quickly while Sleeping\nBabies can learn even while asleep, according to a 2011 study. In experiments with 26 sleeping infants, each just 1 to 2 days old, scientists played a musical tone followed by a puff of air to their eyes 200 times over the course of a half-hour. 124 electrodes  stuck on the head and face of each baby recorded brain activity during the experiments. The babies rapidly learned to foretell a puff of air upon hearing the tone, showing a four-time increase on average in the chances of tightening their eyelids in response to the sound by the end of the experiments.\nAs newborns spend most of their time asleep, this newfound ability might be crucial to rapidly adapting to the world around them and help to ensure their survival, researchers said.\nJudging Characters Well\nJudging another person helpful or harmful is crucial when choosing friends. And that ability starts early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6-and 10-month-olds a puppet  show, in which one character helped another climb a hill. In another scene a third character pushed the climber down. The little ones then got to choose which character they preferred. For both age groups, most babies chose the helper character. This character-judging ability could be baby's first step in the formation of morals, Hamlin thought."

      "Expressions about water are almost as common as water itself.\nThe expressionto be in hot water is a very old expression. Hot water was used five hundred years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle.\nThat no longer happens. But we still get in hot water. When we are in hot water, we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother, if he walks in the house with dirty shoes.\nBeingin deep wateris almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position.\nTo keep your head above wateris a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\nWater over the dam is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished. It cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water that has flowed over a dam cannot be brought back again.\nAnother common expression to hold water, is about the strength or weakness of an idea or opinion that you may be arguing about. It probably comes from a way of testing the condition of a container.; If it can hold water, it is strong and has no holes in it. If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes.\nThrowing cold water also is an expression that deals with ideas or suggestions. It means to not like an idea. For example, you want to buy a new car because the old one has some problems. But your wife throws cold water on the idea, because she says a new car costs too much."

      "Children grow quickly, especially their feet, but many families cannot buy new shoes each time a child needs them. As a result, about 300 million children around the world go barefoot. Those children risk picking up diseases and parasites from the soil.\nAn American man may have a solution for those barefoot kids -- a shoe that grows with the child. Kenton Lee is the creator of The Shoe That Grows. He explains how the shoe works and how it is able to last so long.\n\"It grows in three places: the front; it can also grow on the side with Velcro; and on the back with our buckle. It can last up to five years. The bottom is compressed rubber like tire rubber. The top is just high-quality leather.\" The shoe comes in two sizes: small that fits children aged 4 to 9 and large for children aged 9 to 14.\nLee says he got the idea for the shoe while working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya. \"... and there was a little girl in a white dress walking next to me. And I just remember looking down and seeing how small her shoes were. They were just way too small for her feet. They were so small that she had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out. And I just remember thinking, wouldn't it be nice if there were a pair of shoes that could grow with her feet?\"\nHowever, Lee says it was not easy to turn his idea into a reality. \"I kept writing down I should do this because of this or because of that. All these reasons why it really was important for me to try to make the shoes that could grow and try to help.\" Finally, in 2009 Lee founded a non-profit organization called Because International. In the office of Because International, Lee keeps a pair of his own shoes to help him remember his promise. \"I told myself I would not get new shoes until the idea was done. So, those are the shoes that I wore for a little over five years.\""

      "Your children's teacher will be providing extra time for test preparation. This school year's test will be held on January 8 and 9. The test preparation time is open to all students, and we strongly encourage your children to attend.\nThis year we are changing the time for our test preparation: it will be on Thursday mornings from 8:10 to 8:50. This helps children who ride the bus and cannot stay for the after-school period. It also helps avoid conflicts with after-school activities.\nDanielle and Marina will be working with the recent new test takers 6 days on the following Thursdays: 15th, Nov; 29th, Nov; 6th, Dec; 13th, Dec.; 20th, Dec. and 3rd, Jan.\nBesides the test preparation lectures on these dates, teachers are already putting test preparation into their usual courses. We are finding that we can help our students to be both skillful and whole-hearted readers and test takers -- after all, we all know that the best test preparation is good reading and writing training.\nWhat can you do at home? Again, the best and most effective test preparation for the ELA test is reading and more reading. The research is quite clear -- students who do well in the tests are those who are good readers. Reading not only builds reading ability, it also helps build confidence -- important for successful test taking! But do discourage your children from spending too much time on books that are too hard or even a bit too hard. Children best develop comprehension skills when they are reading books just right for them (too easy doesn't hurt here either).\nFinally, on Friday, December 7, we will have a morning lecture on the ELA. Please pay attention!"

      "Since people first sent rockets into space in the 1950s, we have been leaving behind all sorts of things. Some of them, like the camera, were lost by astronauts while they did work outside their spaceship. But much of the space junk is made up of little pieces of things that were once bigger objects, until they struck each other and broke apart.\nSome things we send into space fall back toward the earth and burn up in the atmosphere. But larger pieces sometimes survive the extreme heat and hit the ground or the ocean at great speeds. So there is always concern that something may fall from the sky and do some harm.\nBut space junk falling on housetops   is not the biggest worry. Scientists are concerned about what happens when an empty rocket strikes another while orbiting   the earth. Two big things become many smaller things. They then hit other things. The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk that blocks the path of future space vehicles.\nSo what can be done to clean up the space around our planet? Marco Castronuovo, an Italian researcher, talks about sending a satellite into space that would get very close to some of the larger pieces of space junk. The satellite would connect a small rocket to the useless object. When the rocket explodes, it pushes the junk into a lower and slower orbit, nearer the earth. After a time, the junk burns up in the atmosphere.\nMr. Castronuovo has proposed   using a number of small satellites with robotic arms. One arm would catch the space junk, and another arm would connect the rocket. He imagines that each satellite would jump from one large piece of junk to another. He thinks this method could destroy about ten large objects each year.\nScientists have been concerned about space junk for many years. Right now, the costs of the clean-up have been too great. Mr. Castronuovo says his system could be put in place for a much more reasonable amount of money."

      "Educating Girls Is a Real Lifesaver\nClare Short knows it. Every developing economist knows it. The World Bank knows it. The education of girls is the surest way to reduce poverty.\nThe reason is simple. All the evidence shows that taking girls out of the fields and homes, and putting them behind desks, raises economic productivity, lowers infant and maternal  death rates, reduces birth rates, and improves environmental management.\nWhy, then, are 90 million primary school-age girls around the world not in school? For the same reason that when Charles Dickens was writing David Copperfield 150 years ago girls were absent from the British education system: Men in power mostly prefer _ that way, or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so.\nThe countries with the poorest record for having women in positions of power or influence have the worst figures for girls' education. High-profile intervention  by organizations such as the World Bank has begun successfully with several countries, and more of the same will probably be needed to bring change in conservative, male-run states.\nEven if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century.\nTo be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death.\nEvery year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.\nWith women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming. Therefore, the world community cannot afford to ignore this avenue of change."

      "The United States is full of cars. There are still many families without cars, but some families have two or more. However, cars are used for more than pleasure. They are a necessary part of life.\nCars are used for business. They are driven to offices and factories by workers who have no other way to get to their jobs. When salesmen are sent to different parts of the city, they have to drive in order to carry their products. Farmers have to drive into the city in order to get supplies.\nSometimes small children must be driven to school. In some cities school buses are used only when children live more than a mile away from the school. When the children are too young to walk too far, their mothers take turns driving them to school. One mother drives on Mondays taking her own children and the neighbors' as well. Another mother drives on Tuesdays, another on Wednesday, and so on. This is called forming a car pool. Men also form car pools, with three or four men taking turns driving to the place where they all work.\nMore car pools should be formed in order to put fewer cars on the road and use less gas.

They moved in and out of homeless shelters.\nEverything changed for Zoe in grade nine. At that time, she heard about a sewing  class at her school. She signed up and couldn't wait to turn her designs into clothes. The color of the first dress she made was white-black strips. Soon the clothes she wore were all made by her. Other girls at school loved her designs too. They asked her if they could buy dresses from her. Zoe sold her first dress for $13. Unfortunately, it cost her $25 to make the dress. \"I had the creativity in designs,\" says Zoe. \"But I really had no idea about business.\"\nZoe kept selling the clothes she designed. Her business was booming, and even the girls who had ever teased her became her customers. In the eleventh grade, Zoe took a business class.

The contest was for teens from all over the United States. Zoe sent in her business plan, which explained how she planned to make her company grow. She won the second prize in the end. Zoe 's success became a news item. Supermodel Tyra Banks heard about it and she invited Zoe to take part in her TV show. \"Being recognized I felt really unreal,\"says Zoe.

      "If women are mercilessly exploited year after year, they have only themselves to blame.  Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.\nChanging fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste. Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way, waste hours of their time altering the dresses they have. Skirts are lengthened or shortened; neck-lines are lowered or raised, and soon.\nNo one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability. They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn't at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day, or delicately picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes.\nWhen comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, _ . Does the constantly changing fashion of women's clothes, one wonders, reflect basic qualities of instability? Men are too clever to let themselves be cheated by fashion designers. Do their unchanged styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability? That is for you to decide."

      "Occasionally, my father came back drunk. Late at night, he beat on the door, pleading to my mother to open it .He was on his way home from drinking, gambling, or some combination thereof, misspending money that we could have used and wasting time that we desperately needed.\nIt was the late-1970s. My parents were separated. My mother was now raising a group of boys on her own. My father spouted off about what he planned to do for us, buy for us.In fact, he had no intention of doing anything. As a father who was supposed to love us, in fact, he lacked the understanding of what it truly meant to love a child--or to hurt one. To him, this was a harmless game that kept us excited and begging. In fact, it was a cruel, corrosive lie. I lost faith in his words and in him. I wanted to stop caring, but I couldn't.\nMaybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father's family that caused him cold. Maybe it was the pain and guilt associated with a life of misfortune. Who knows. Whatever it was, it stole him from us, and particularly from me.\nWhile my brothers talked about breaking and fixing things, I spent many of my evenings reading and wondering. My favorite books were a set of encyclopedias  given by my uncle. They allowed me to explore the world beyond my world, to travel without leaving, to dream dreams greater than my life would otherwise have supported. But losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely lost to my father. Not understanding me, he simply ignored me--not just emotionally, but physically as well. Never once did he hug me, never once a pat on the back or a hand on the shoulder or a tousling of the hair.\nMy best memories of him were from his episodic attempts at engagement with us. During the longest of these episodes , once every month or two, he would come pick us up and drive us down the interstate to Trucker's Paradise, a seedy, smoke-filled, truck stop with gas pumps, a convenience store, a small dining area and a game room through a door in the back. My dad gave each of us a handful of quarters, and we played until they were gone. He sat up front in the dining area, drinking coffee and being particular about the restaurant's measly offerings.\nI loved these days. To me, Trucker's Paradise was paradise. The quarters and the games were fun but easily forgotten. It was the presence of my father that was most treasured. But, of course, these trips were short-lived.\nIt wasn't until I was much older that I would find something that I would be able to _ as evidence of my father's love.\nWhen the Commodore 64 personal computer debuted, I convinced myself that I had to have it even though its price was out of my mother's range. So I decided to earn the money myself. I mowed every yard I could find that summer for a few dollars each, yet it still wasn't enough. So my dad agreed to help me raise the rest of the money by driving me to one of the watermelon farms south of town, loading up his truck with wholesale melons and driving me around to sell them. He came for me before daybreak. We made small talk, but it didn't matter. The fact that he was talking to me was all that mattered. I was a teenager by then, but this was the first time that I had ever spent time alone with him. He laughed and repeatedly introduced me as \"my boy,\" a phrase he relayed with a sense of pride. It was one of the best days of my life.\nAlthough he had never told me that he loved me, I would _ that day as the greatest evidence of that fact. He had never intended me any wrong. He just didn't know how to love me right. He wasn't a mean man. So I took these random episodes and _ them like a thing most precious, storing them in my mind for the long stretches of coldness when a warm memory would prove most useful.\nIt just goes to show that no matter how friendless the father, no matter how deep the damage, no matter how shattered the bond, there is still time, still space, still a need for even the smallest bit of evidence of a father's love.\n\"My boy.\""

      "One night recently , I was driving down a two-lane highway at about 60 miles an hour . A car approached from the opposite direction at about the same speed . As we passed each other , I caught the other driver's eye for only a second . I wondered whether he might be thinking , as I was , how dependent we were on each other at that moment . I was relying on him not to fall asleep , not to be put off by a phone conversation, not to cross over into my lane and bring my life to a sudden end . Though we had never spoken a word to each other , he relied on me in just the same way .\nMultiplied a million times over, I believe that is the way the world works . At some level , we all depend upon one another . Sometimes that dependence requires us simply not to do something like crossing over the double yellow line . And sometimes it requires us to act cooperatively , with friends or even with strangers .\nAs technology shrinks our world , the need increases for cooperative action among nations . In 2003, doctors in five nations were quickly organized to identify the SARS virus , which saved thousands of lives . The threat of international terrorism has shown itself to be a similar problem, one requiring coordinated action by police and intelligence forces across the world . We must recognize that our fates   are not ours alone to control .\nIn my own life , I've put great stock in personal responsibility . But , as the years have passed, I've also come to believe that there are moments when one must rely upon the good faith and judgment of others . so , while each of us faces the case of driving alone down a dark road , what we must learn is that the approaching light may not be a threat , but a shared moment of trust ."

      "From a very early age, some children show better self-control than others. Now, a new study that began with about 1,000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child's low self-control can predict poor health, money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years.\nResearchers have been studying this group of children for decades now. They observed the level of self-control the youngsters displayed. Parents, teachers, even the kids themselves, scored the youngsters on measures like \"acting before thinking\" and \"Persistence in reaching goals.\"\nThe study led  by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\"The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,\" Moffitt said,\"and they had the worst financial situation. They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income.\" Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren't just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids.\nMoffitt said it's still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other researchers have found that it's mostly a learned behavior, with relatively little genetic influence. But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents. But the good news, Moffitt said, is that self-control can be taught by parents, and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective."

      "It is well known that Einstein was the father of the famous Theory of Relativity. But do you know it owes a great deal to Marits, Einstein's former wife?\nIn 1896, 17-year-old Einstein went to Zurich to study physics. There he met a girl from Hungary. They studied in the same class. The same interest brought the two together and the young man fell in love with Marits. In 1903, when Einstein was 24 years old, he married Marits, who was 4 years older than he.\nAfter their marriage, Einstein devoted himself to the research of the great theory. To give her husband more help, Marits gave up her own work, and became a good wife and assistant. She tried her best to encourage him whenever possible and she was sure that her husband would succeed. They often discussed the theory while walking outside or sitting together in the room. They even discussed it in their letters when one of them was away from home.\nIn 1914, the Einstein moved to Berlin and settled there. At that time, Einstein's theory proved to be correct and he had become famous all over the world. Marits was very proud of him and his success. But it was not long before the First World War broke out. Marits as well as her two sons, who were all on holidays in Switzerland, couldn't come back to Berlin. The war not only stopped Einstein's work but broke up the warm, happy family. In 1919, Einstein and Marits had to get divorced.\nEinstein himself, however, later said that Marits was really an outstanding woman."

The young students learned their moviemaking skills at the Jacob Burns Film Center. The center is in Pleasantville, New York. Kids who go there learn how to make movies and music videos.\nThe character Oliver and his treats are animated. In an animated movie, objects, such as ice cream and paper dolls, appear to be alive or moving.\nAnimated movies are made up of hundreds of pictures. It takes 15 pictures to make just one second of film. To make a movie that lasts one minute, students need to take about 900 frames. A frame is a picture.\nAnimation expert Joe Summerhays teaches kids the steps to shoot a movie. He says what they learn behind the scenes, however, also counts. Students create their films in small groups. They have to agree on every decision.\n \" The benefit of the class is less animation and more problem-solving,\" Summerhays said. \"It's all about teamwork.\"\nAbout 4,000 kids have made movies at the Jacob Burns Film Center.

For three years he learned from him.Then one day,when he thought he had learned everything,the thought arose in him:\"If I kill this old man,then I will be the greatest archer.\"\nThe old man had gone to cut wood and he was coming back carrying wood on his shoulder.The young man hid behind a tree,waiting to kill him.He shot an arrow.The old man took a small piece of wood and threw it.It struck the arrow and the arrow turned back and wounded the young man very deeply.The old man came,took out the arrow and said. \"I knew that some day or other you were going to do this.That's why I have not taught you this secret.There is no need to kill me.My Master is still alive,and I'm  nothing before him.You must be  with him for at least thirty years.And he is very old,so go fast!

      "Soon after you have your first child, the question of having a second one is raised by friends and family. However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child. \nToday, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family. \nRaising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college.\nMost young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand. \nWith several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things. A happy child, who deserves the rightful attention, love, care, and time from both the parents, always gets a meaningful childhood, for both the parents and the child."

      "Though the facts that too many people on earth and a too rapid increase in the number added each year are not in argument, we always begin the discussion of \"population as global issue\" with what most persons mean like this. It was quite right to compare demographic growth to \"a long, thin powder fuse that bums steadily and hesitatingly until it finally reaches the charge and explodes\".\nTo understand the current situation, which is characterized by rapid increases in population, it is necessary to understand the history of population trends. Rapid growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Looking back at the 8,000 years of demographic history, we find that populations have been virtually stable or growing very slightly for most of human history. For most of our ancestors, life was hard, often nasty, and very short. There was high fertility in most places, but this was usually balanced by high mortality. For most of human history, it was seldom the case that one in ten persons would live past forty, while infancy and childhood were especially risky periods. Often, societies were in clear danger of extinction because death rates could exceed their birthrates. Thus, the population problem throughout most of history was how to prevent extinction of the human race.\nThis pattern is important to notice. Not only does it put the current problems of demographic growth into a historical perspective, but it suggests that the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years is not a sudden\nenthusiasm for more children, but an improvement in the conditions that traditionally have caused high mortality.\nDemographic history can be divided into two major periods: a time of long, slow growth which extended from about 8000 B.C. till approximately 1650 A.D. In the first period of some 9,600 years, the population increased from some 8 million to 500 million in 1650. Between 1650 and 1975, the population has increased from 500 million to more than 4 billion. And the population reached 6.2 billion throughout the world by the year 2000, One way to appreciate this dramatic difference in such abstract numbers is to reduce the time frame to something that is more manageable. Between 8000 B.C. and 1650, an average of only 50,000 persons was being added annually to the world's population, At present, this number is added every six hours. The increase is about 800000,000 persons annually."

      "Attitude is an internal  state that influences the choices of personal action made by the individual . Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual.\nThe kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas-all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired  throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school.\nOf course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude.\nAttitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single events, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them. And frequently, they are learned by copying other people's behavior, as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents. Regardless of these differences, there is something in common in the learning and modification  of attitudes."

It started in January 1994 when two California graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, started compiling a database of links, mainly for their personal use. But well before the end of the year, it had become recognizable as Yahoo we know today. In the past seven years, Yahoo had grown rapidly, partly through a long string of buys. Yahoo now offers almost everything you could want: emails, instant messages, chats, clubs, photo albums and a lot more.\neBay Enables Everyone to Buy and Sell\neBay(www.ebay.com),which deals with online trading and shopping services, is the most impressive large Internet company where people buy and sell goods and services worldwide. It has, for instance, opened up a global marketplace in which people from Beijing, San Francisco, or Moscow can bid against each other for products put up for sale by someone in London. The company's online service permits sellers to list items for sale, buyers to bid on items of interest, and eBay users to browse through listed items that is available online seven days a week.\nAmazon Makes Buying a New Experience\nAmazon(www.amazon.com)started out as an online bookstore, constantly putting up new book titles it offered for sale. In the late 1990s, Amazon had more than four million titles after adding CDs, videos, DVDs and games, It continued to add new lines of business including toys, computer software, electronics, like MP3 players, power tools, home improvement products and online sales. For regular users, Amazon has made itself the shortest possible path between wanting and buying."

      "In today's Internet age, online games can be a change from the pressure of school and work. However, they can also cause problems and unhealthy addictions. This is most clearly seen in the example of South Korea. This country has the world's highest percentage of high-speed Internet services. It also has a high number of game players who are addicted to online games.\nIn 2004, a young man died after playing online games almost nonstop for 86 hours. A 12-year-old boy stole $16,000 from his father to continue online games which he could not get away from. Such problems are spreading to other parts of Asia as well. In 2005, it was reported that about 80 percent of China's 13.8 million online game players were under 25. And many of these were said to be addicted. Such numbers point toward a growing problem among Chinese youth.\nDr. Sue-Huei Chen, a psychologist, discovered some signs of at-risk people. Such people often go online to escape from their problems. And they usually have no friendship or good social skills. They feel the need to spend more and more time online, so they may be absent from school or family. And they become upset if anyone tries to shorten their online game playing."

      "Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.\nThe report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition   and heat-related health problems.\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was \"a methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable   regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost   attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed  .\"\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability  to climate hazards while still curbing   the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report."

But Lee realized something was wrong when Alex came home one day, crying, with \"zeroes\" on his Chinese spelling test. Lee decided to investigate. According to Lee, the teacher would frequently describe Alex's Chinese writing as 'ghost writings' and made him a laughing stock in class instead of helping him out.\nLee, 46, spent the next 12 months teaching Alex and still helps him when necessary. She not only taught him the formation of the Chinese words but also their origin so that he could understand better, often taking more than an hour to read a simple paragraph. Visits to the library and surfing the Internet kept her up to speed on teaching materials. Alex's grades improved and by the end of Year One, he had become one of the top students in Chinese in his class.\nAlex is keeping an A - plus average in all subjects, and his mother's involvement is a big reason behind it. Alex, now 11, recently wrote a book recording his struggles with Chinese, which an international education center has published to inspire its students. He sometimes writes for local student magazines as well. \nLee has always had input into the education of Alex. She reads to him \"all the time.\" As a result, he is an eager reader who regularly visit the library.\nTo Lee, one of the most valuable things she does is to take turns with her husband to drive Alex to school. \"We'd talk along the way. Talking enables me to have a better understanding of my child and reminds me of changes every now and then so that I know when to get involved, she says.\""

      "There are a number of different ways to study a language, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. You may find a combination of these is a best choice for you.\nIf you can find a course in the language you want to learn in your country, this is quite a good way to study. A variety of courses are usually available, including part-time and full-time courses. If you look around, you can probably find a course that suits your needs.\nThe main advantage of such courses is that you'll have a teacher to provide you with instructions, support and with whom to practice your language. You will also be studying with others who are at more or less the same level and you can exchange ideas with them and help one another.\nOne choice is to study a language in a country where it's spoken. There are many schools teaching English, French, Spanish, Italian and German, but far fewer teaching other languages. The main advantage of studying abroad is that you are totally in the language, not just in class, but the rest of the time as well. As a result, you can make rapid progress.\nThe main disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost, not just of your course, but also of your food and travel. However, if you're a native speaker of English, you could get a job teaching English in a country where the language you want to learn is spoken.\nStudying online is also a good choice. There are plenty to choose from a lot of languages. Many are free but there are some you have to pay for. Some of the paid ones provide support from teachers via email, chat programs, video conferencing, telephone or even face to face."

      "What is a lifestyle and how is that different from a life? A lifestyle is about brand names and buying identity or fame. Lifestyle gives a false sense of peace and acceptability that comes from others recognizing what you've bought into (as well as bought). If your car, clothes, and home are expensive, you're sophisticated  and stylish. If you have the right kind of job or go to the right social gatherings, then you receive the insincere approval of others. This means that your self-esteem  is always at the mercy of others, with no appreciation of you as an individual.\nA life, on the other hand, is very different. A life is what you lead when you know what matters most to you. It is very simple and comes from being connected to what you know is important and being willing to put that first, no matter what others may think. When you create a life vs. a lifestyle, your self-esteem comes from what's inside you, not what others think about you.\nLifestyle is expensive financially and personally, because it costs a great deal to keep up appearances and do what you think is socially acceptable. A life is not expensive. Rather than using personal or financial resources, a life generates energy and staying power. It's about liberating yourself from the mindless consumption that society expects. It is about making the choices that are in line with your values, instead of using up your bank account or energy for no heart-driven reason.\nHow can you make the change? Understand the difference between a life and a lifestyle. Analyze your current lifestyle to see what is costing you in money, time, stress, and energy to maintain it. Let go and make room for what is really important to you, what supports you and brings you joy. Remember who you are from within, not what you own!"

      "Recently I have discovered it's often easier for me to do something every day than to do it just some days. I post to my blog six days a week. I take notes every day. I write in my one-sentence journal every day. Many people have told me that they find it easier to exercise when they exercise every day. If I try to do something just four days a week, I spend a lot of time arguing with myself: Is today the day, or is it tomorrow, or the next day? Does the week start on Sunday or Monday?\nIf you do something every day, you tend to fall into a routine. Routine has a bad reputation for lacking excitement. It's true that novelty and challenge bring happiness and that people who break their routines, try new things, and go to new places are happier, but I think that some routine activities also bring happiness. The pleasure of doing the same thing, in the same way, every day, shouldn't be overlooked. By repeating, you can find happiness in activities like doing dishes or sweeping the floor as well as in your beloved morning coffee-and-news routines.\nTwo geniuses whom I know of also wrote about the power of doing something every day. Andy Warhol wrote, \"Either once only, or every day. If you do something once it's exciting, and if you do it every day it's exciting. But if you do it, say, twice or just almost every day, it's not good any more.\" Gertrude Stein made a similar point, \"Anything one does every day is important and anywhere one lives is interesting and beautiful.\"\nSo if there's something that you wish you did more regularly, try doing it every day; if you do something every day, take great pleasure in it."

      "More than two thirds of the world's polar bears will be wiped out by 2050,according to a shocking new study. By then,scientists say,global warming will have melted 42 percent of the Arctic sea ice. By 2100,only a very few of these important creatures will be left.\nThe report has been produced by the US Geological Survey. The scientists have publicized their findings in the hope of influencing US Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne,who has been asked to put polar bears on the US endangered species list.\nPolar bears depend on floating sea ice as a platform for hunting seals,which are their main food. Without enough ice,polar bears would be forced to go onto the land,where they are poorly skilled hunters,and would be unlikely to adapt to the life on the land in time. Experts say few little bears would survive and the stress could make many females unable to get pregnant.\nThe team of American and Canadian scientists spent six months studying bears,on the ground,from spotter planes and in the lab,using computer models.\nSome team members fear the result is even worse for the bears than what their report says. They say the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere in the world and much faster than their computer had been forecasting. Satellite observations have showed that the ice has decreased to an all-time low.\nHowever,not everyone in the scientific community believes that global warming is happening on such an alarming scale. Another investigation has found that polar bears are still being hunted by wealthy \"sportsmen\" who want their skins and heads. At least ten international companies offer bear-hunting trips."

      "Sheep, like turkeys and ostriches, are not considered the cleverest animals. British scientists said last Wednesday human may have underestimated  the woolly creatures. They could be much smarter than we think.\nResearchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern. England, have shown that animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence.\nBehavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish  25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes  to measure their brain activity, which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years.\n\"If they can do that with faces, the fact is that they have to have reasonable intelligence, otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering anything else,\" Kendrick said in an interview.\nSo hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all.\nKendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much ind\nividuality and are frightened of just about everything.\nAll animals, including humans, once they are frightened don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\" he explained.\nIn research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain, which allows them to distinguish between many different faces that look extremely similar.\n\"The most important findings of the study is that they are able, both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized, to remember a large number of faces of individuals for a very long time,\" said Kendrick. \"It is a very strange system.

      "Three Central Texas men were honored with the Texas Department of Public Safety's Director's Award in a Tuesday morning ceremony for their heroism in saving the victims of a fiery two car accident.\nThe accident occurred on March 25 when a vehicle lost control while traveling on a rain-soaked State Highway 6 near Baylor Camp Road. It ran into an oncoming vehicle, leaving the occupants trapped inside as both vehicles burst into flames.\nBonge was the first on the scene and heard children screaming. He broke through a back window and pulled Mallory Smith, 10, and her sister, Megan Smith,9,from the wreckage.\nThe girls' mother, Beckie Smith, was not with them at the time of the wreck, as they were traveling with their baby sitter, Lisa Bow bin.\nBeckie Smith still remembers the sickening feeling she had up on receiving the call informing her of the wreck and the despair as she drove to the scene.\nBozeman and Clemmons arrived shortly after Bonge and helped rescue the other victims and attempted to put out the fires.\n\"I was nervous,\" Bozeman said.\" I don't feel like I'm a hero. I was just doing what anyone should do in that situation. I hope someone would do the same for me.\"\nEveryone at the accident made it out alive, with the victims suffering from nonlife-threatening injuries. Mallory Smith broke both femurs, and Megan had neck and back injuries. Bowbin is still recovering from a broken pelvis, ankle and foot.\nThe rescuers also were taken to the hospital and treated for cuts and smoke breathing, Bonge said.\nIn addition, Bozeman not to meet accident victim Anthony Rus so in the hospital after the accident, where Russo presented him with a glass frame inscribed with\" Thank you,\" Bozeman said. Those involved in that fateful encounter on Highway 6 credited God blessing for bringing them together.\n\"Whatever the circumstances, Tuesday's ceremony provided a time to be grateful for those who put their lives on the line for the lives of complete strangers,\" Beckie Smith said,\" We're calling it The Miracle on Highway 6.\""

Will you let me teach you what I know?\"\n\"Oh, yes!\" Ed answered.\nIn the next four years, Mr. Dee trained Ed to be a fine player. The boy worked hard. At last Mr. Dee talked to Ed's father. \"This boy is ready to play with the big teams,\" he said. \"Let me take him to a city that has a good team.\"\nMr. Dee took Ed to Santos, Brazil.

      "Sure, it's good to get along with your teacher because it makes that time you spend in the classroom more pleasant. And yes, it's good to get along with your teacher because, in general, it's smart to learn how to relate to the different types of people you'll meet throughout your life.\nBut really, there's one super-important reason why you should get along with your teacher. Kids who get along with their teachers not only learn more, but they're more comfortable asking questions and getting extra help. This makes it easier to understand new material and do your best on tests. When you have this kind of relationship with a teacher, he or she can be someone to turn to with problems, such as problems with learning or school issues, such as bullying.\nAs a kid in elementary or middle school, you're at a wonderful stage in your life. You're able to take in lots of new and exciting information. Apart from that, you're able to think about all this information in new ways. Your teacher knows that, and in most cases, he or she is thrilled to be the person who's giving you all that material and helping you put it together. Remember, teachers are people, too, and they feel great if you're open to what they're teaching you. That's why they wanted to be teachers in the first place to teach!\nSome kids may be able to learn in any situation, whether they like the teacher or not. But most kids are sensitive to the way they get along with the teacher, and if things aren't going well, they won't learn as well and won't enjoy being in class."

      "On the site of the 9/11 tragedy, Irish university professor Elizabeth Stinger Keefe found an image of hope-- a wedding photo of a happy couple and their friends lay among the rubble  of the Twin Towers. As a gesture of goodwill, she decided to try and reunite the picture with either its owner or a  .\nEvery year, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks, she would make an attempt, posting the picture on social media and asking others to share it. Finally, after a remarkable 13 years, her work paid off. Thanks to the power of social media, her appeal was more widely shared than ever before.\nA man named Fred Mahe called Ms Keefe after the image went viral -- to tell her that he was in fact in the picture and that all six people photographed were alive and well. He said that the image belonged to him and had been lost in the rubble after 9/11.The photo was originally taken at a friend's wedding in Colorado, earlier in 2001. Mahe said, \"The picture was at my desk in the world Trade Center, Tower Two, on the 77th floor. I never thought it could have been kept safe by Keefe for the last 13 years.\"\nMahe said that he was in touch with Keefe over the phone and described the conversation as \"dedication and persistence\" to continue to seek the owner of the photo. \"She kept my photo safe for 13 years in her favorite Ernest Hemingway book, A Moveable Feast.\" Mahe said he wasn't yet at work as the attacks began on 9/11, and, \"thankfully never got a chance to go up to my office.\"\nAnd Mahe's wife has even invited Keefe to Thanksgiving dinner. Now the pair have reconnected with a piece of their past as Keefe has finally returned the picture to its rightful owner and has made a new friend in the process."

Some serious thinkers are starting to imagine just that.\nBart: I don't know that present-day electronic chips are, but some sort of chips -- I'd guess maybe plastic. Our three-pound brain is definitely a wonder, perhaps the greatest wonder of natural biology. In this coming century, we'll be re-engineering the brain a piece at a time, first with implants  and finally engineering an complete replacement. There's no question that in the distant future we'll play the music of the mind on instruments different from the current ones. So, yes, chips are our destiny  .\nEdward: In 3000 perhaps the biggest difference from today is that there will be no more men. Females can have female children, without any need for men. In about ten years, we'll find the cocktail that women can take to have female children. There'll be no need for men at all.\nGreg: What is Heaven? Heaven's a place where you can create worlds at will, and the ideal Heaven is where you run the whole thing yourself. The current means of getting to Heaven involve various supernatural systems for which, at this point, there's no scientific evidence. So I think we can reduce Heaven to an engineering project which we're doing. The demand for Heaven is great--witness the desire of every human heart, from the people who built the ancient pyramids to modern society, to live beyond one's given time. Our plan is to change human consciousness from the brain to bits of information in a computer chip, or some other kind of computational medium, so that just by thinking we'll be able to create our own personal world. And I think the first stage of Heaven will be the feeling world, and beyond that I think we'd find a higher, more spiritual plane."

      "Some kinds of mental skills naturally decrease as people get older. Yet research seems to show that some training can improve such skills. A recently published study also appears to demonstrate that the good effects of training can last for many years after that training has ended.\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland wanted to learn how long memory and thinking skills would last in older people who trained to keep them. The people were part of the ten-year research project. They were taught methods meant to improve their memory, thinking and ability to perform everyday tasks.\nMore than 2,800 volunteered for the study called ACTIVE - short for Advanced (Cognitive) Training for Independent and Vital Elderly. Most studied when they were more than 70 years old.\nThe volunteers took one of several short training classes meant to help them keep their mental abilities. One class trained participants in skills including how to remember word lists. Another group trained in reasoning. A third group received help with speed-of-processing - speed of receiving and understanding information. A fourth group - the control group did not get any training.\nEarlier results had established that the training helped the participants for up to five years. Now, lead study writer George Rebok says, the research showed most of the training remained effective a full ten years later.\nProfessor Rebok and his team found that the people trained in reasoning and speed-of-processing did better on tests than the control group.\n\"We are wondering whether those effects which endured over time would still be there ten years following the training, and in fact, that's exactly what we found.\"\nThe effect on memory, however, seemed not to last as long. Still, the old people in any of the three classes generally reported less difficulty in performing daily activities than the control group. The total training time for the older people was between 10 and 15 hours."

      "Did the iPod kill music ?\nDID Steve Jobs kill the music industry? That's the question on many people's lips since rock star Jon Bon Jovi accused the apple boss of personally destroying the music industry.\nBon Jovi centers his criticism   on how he believes music downloading has robbed young people of what he calls the \"beauty of buying on album\", \"Kids today have missed the beauty of taking your allowance   money and making a decision based on the  _ , not knowing what the record sounded like,\" he said.\nBut far from killing the industry, many young people today think Jobs has been a blessing  , offering you instant, and selective access to a whole world of music.\nKeith Staskiewicz at Entertainment Weekly speaks for the feelings of many music lovers. He believes listening to Mp3s rather than records or CDs \"just saves them money\" and doesn't \"eliminate   the sense of discovery they get from new music\", Staskiewicz also argues that it's wrong to blame Jobs and Apple for destroying anything.\"Change is just part of the business,\" Staskiewicz said. \"No doubt in 50 years, Justin Bieber will complain in his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech about how kids don't listen to iPods any more.\"\nFor now, though, it appears that music downloading is set to continue for the near future. According to Summer Redstone, chairman of media company Viacom, iTunes has \"resurrected   the music industry by creating a legal, affordable purchasing system for fans\".\nBut recent surveys suggested that, despite the \"legalizing\" of music downloading via sites like iTunes, young people are still choosing to download music illegally.A report by Jupiter Research suggested that illegal downloading sites are used three times as much as legal ones. \nThe problem, according to its analyst Mark Mulligan, is how today's youth grow up viewing music as something they can get for free. \"Unless the music industry can shift these consumers   while they are young away from free consumption to paid music formats  ,they may never develop music purchasing behavior,\" warned Mulligan \" recording industry could suffer long-term harm.\""

Nothing.\nWe were not completely uninterested in culture.But this was a first holiday without parents,as it was for most other Inter-Railers,and in organizing our own timetable  we left out everything except the most available sights.This was the chance to escape the guided tour,an opportunity to do something different.I took great pride in the fact that.in many places,all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station.We were just there to get by,and to have good time doing so.In this we were not different from most of the other Inter-Raiders with whom we shared passage  floors,food and water,money and music.\nThe excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time."

      "The U. S. Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars a year. The government company that delivers \"small mail\" is losing out to email and other types of electronic communication. First-class mail amount fell from a high point of 104 million pieces in 2000 to just 64 million pieces by 2014.\nCongress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail. The company pays no federal, state or local taxes; pays no vehicle fees; and is free from many regulations on other businesses. Despite these advantages, the USPS has lost $52 billion since 2007, and will continue losing money without major reforms.\nThe problem is that Congress is preventing the USPS from reducing costs as its sales decline, and is blocking efforts to end Saturday service and close unneeded post office locations. USPS also has a costly union-dominated workforce that slows the introduction of new ideas or methods down. USPS workers earn significantly higher payment than comparable private-sector workers. The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition. With the rise of the Internet, the argument that mail is a natural monopoly that needs government protection is weaker than ever.\nOther countries facing declining letter amounts have made reforms Germany and the Netherlands privatized their national postal companies over a decade ago, and other European countries have followed suit. Britain floated shares of the Royal Mail on its stock exchange in 2013. Some countries, such us Sweden and New Zealand, have not privatized their national postal companies, but they have opened them up to competition.\nThese reforms have driven efficiency improvements in all of these countries. Additional number of workers have been reduced, productivity has risen and consumers have benefited. Also, note that cost-cutting measures--such as closing tone post offices--are good for both the economy and the environment.\nPrivatization and competition also encourage new changes. When the USPS monopoly over \"extremely urgent\" mail was stopped in 1979, we saw an explosion in efficient overnight private delivery by firms such as FedEx.\nThe government needs to wake up to changing technology, study postal reforms abroad and let businessmen reinvent our out-of-date postal system."

      "We all use money every day. It is essential because we can pay money for whatever we want.Money is recognized as banknotes and coins.\nHowever,many years ago people couldn' t go to the shop and buy what they wanted.They had to get what they wanted through the barter trade .It was really difficult,for the barter often depended on coincidence of wants.For example,the seller of grain has to find a buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer something the seller wants to buy.And one more example,if a wheat farmer needs what a fruit farmer produces,a direct exchange is impossible because seasonal fruit would spoil before the grain harvest.The solution is to trade fruit for wheat indirectly through a third intermediate commodity ,such as cattle,salt,shells,wine.However,commodity money had their disadvantages.For example,cattle,fur,precious stones couldn' t be cut into smaller pieces and it was inconvenient to keep and transport them.Thus coins were invented.\nThe earliest known coins in the western world came from Lydia in about 650 B.C.Greek cities,the Great Persian Empire and Roman Empire quickly adopted the new useful technique of metal currency.And by the end of the 6th century,coinages were common throughout the region.However,coins as well as commodity money had many disadvantages.For instance,coins quickly show wear  and they usually have small value,so it' s difficult to count large sums of coins.\nAt first,paper money was used in China in about 650 A.D.After then,it was used in Persia and Japan.In Europe,paper money was firstly produced in the Netherlands in the 16th century and in the USA in the 17th century.Paper money is worthless but symbolic.In other words,paper money is just a note.It has a purchasing power because the government announces it as money and citizens accept it universally."

      "Have you ever stood side by side with an elephant and touched its ear or its long nose? A marvelous opportunity is offered here for you to experience working with these giant animals. The daily highlight is the walk from the elephant orphanage down to the river to bathe the elephants. Imaging what an amazing fun it is to watch an entire herd splashing  around and rolling in the river just feet in front of you!\nThis opportunity is available through a programme designed for visitors and volunteers to work in the world-famous government-run elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka. The orphanage is regarded as one of the largest centers of its kind in the world, with one of the most successful captive breeding  programmes for Asian elephants.\nPinnawela Orphanage is situated in the hills of central Sri Lanka. It was established in 1975 by the Sir Lanka Wildlife Department. The orphanage's 24 acres  are a home for the many baby elephants found in the jungle without their mothers. In most of these cases the mothers had either died or been killed. Baby elephants cared for by the orphanage are released into the wild when they reach a certain age.\nThe volunteers' working hours are quite short so there is plenty of time to sightsee and explore. The volunteer work consists mainly of the day-to-day aspects of running the orphanage, rather than more specialized research-based work.\nThe volunteers' main duties are cleaning the elephant homes in the morning (hard, muddy work!) and bathing some of the smaller elephants. Some elephants are overly large or have not been tamed or trained to a satisfactory level. However there are still enough opportunities to have full hands-on contact safely.\nWhile the mahouts are bathing the larger elephants, you will have a chance to relax by the river, chat with the mahouts and watch the elephants play and interact with humans and each other. It is an  ly beautiful sight. Being around these serene animals in such a beautiful setting can have a very calming effect!\nIf you are interested in such an experience, contact us for more information."

      "Pets are popular. They're good listeners, they encourage us to exercise, and they're always on our side when we argue with others. They can bring people comfort and pleasure.\nBut it is important to keep in mind that pets can carry diseases that can make you sick. Washing your hands often -- especially after you touch, feed, or clean up a pet -- is the best way to keep yourself healthy and prevent the spread of disease. Be sure to clean your fingernails carefully every time you wash.\nYou also can protect your health by wearing gloves while cleaning animal cages or cat litter boxes. Avoid washing your pet in the bathtub , but if you do, always disinfect  the tub immediately afterward.\nBe sure to bring your pet to the hospital for examinations every two weeks or month and whenever your pet is sick or injured.\nYou can do a few other things to keep yourself and your pet healthy. Only give your pet food that has been planned ahead for them. It's not a good idea to share your food with your pet. Human food (like chocolate) can make animals sick. Never feed your pet raw  meat because it can carry germs  that cause serious illness.\nAnd funny as it can be to see your dog or cat drinking from the toilet, don't let pets do this. It's bad for your pet's health! Give them clean, fresh water to drink at all times.\nNever give milk to cats. The only milk an animal should drink is from its mother. Cow's milk is not for pets, especially for cats, as _ makes them sick.\nFinally, some animals aren't pets. Don't take in a wild or abandoned  animal as a pet because it may have diseases that could make you or your family sick. Instead, turn to an animal rescue group that is trained in helping sick or abandoned animals."

      "As the Internet's influence grows, the potential for danger also escalates  . One of these dangers is from cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying   is repeatedly hurting someone else through the use of technology. It consists of sending or posting cruel messages, photos, or videos on the Internet or other electronic media with the intent of damaging the reputation of the target. Imagine being a 13-year-old girl discovering a cell phone picture of her changing clothes for gym class has been sent to all her classmates. Or imagine being an 11-year-old boy who is scared to go to school because an unknown bully sent him an instant message saying that he is so fat that he should kill himself. Cases such as these are happening every day, leading kids to be depressed and unable to concentrate.\nWorse yet, parents are oblivious   to what is happening. Only 15 percent of parents even know what cyber-bullying is. And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong. 90 percent of middle school students have had their feelings hurt online and 75 percent have admitted to visiting a website attacking another student.\nUnlike traditional schoolyard bullying, where a bully has a name and a face, cyber-bullying gets much of its power from anonymity  . A cyber bully might design a website posting cruel remarks about a classmate and never tell anyone that he or she was the creator. The cyber-bullying also gets its power from the scope   of its audience. Within seconds, a cyber bully can send an e-mail to everyone he or she knows, inviting them to take part in an online poll   of who is the ugliest kid in their class. Victims can be picked on day and night from any place.\nThe good news is that you can help stop cyber-bullying. By making parents and educators aware of what is going on and encouraging them to take quick and strong action when cyber-bullying cases happen, you can help make technology constructive, not destructive, for young people."

In India the need for such protection was realized centuries ago.\n  About 300 B.C. an Indian writer described forests that were somewhat like national parks today. The killing of game animals was carefully governed. Some animals were fully protected. Within the forest, nobody was allowed to cut trees, burn wood, or trap animals for their furs. Animals that became dangerous to human visitors were trapped or killed outside the park, so that other animals would not become uneasy.\n  The need for wildlife protection is greater now than ever before. About a thousand sorts of animals are in danger of extinction, and the speed at which they are being destroyed has been putting on. With mammals, for example, the speed of extinction is now about one sort every year; from A. D. 1 to 1800, the speed was about one sort every fifty years.

      "Are you addicted to computer games? Do you stay up all night playing them? Do you feel happy after you play computer games?\nThere's no doubt that the excitement and appealing of games these days makes them hard to put down. We are attracted by the choice when it comes to gaming: You can role play--creating your own fantasy characters and stories, giving you a chance to step out of everyday life into an imaginary world. And there are shooting games where you can let out your anger and depression in violent situations where you kill people with guns. You can get excited from the games.\nHowever, can these kinds of games really be fun and can being absorbed in virtual reality be good for us? Should we worry about their effects on our health? Popular games like Grand Theft Auto have been blamed for everything from falling results at school to causing acts of extreme violence. Internet safety adviser, Alan MacKenzie, thinks \"any people understandably will just think that a game is just a game and not realizing the exact content that's in there\". He gives an example of the violence, which he says is \"wholly inappropriate for anybody, not to mention children.\"\nOthers will argue that gaming is a harmless form of entertainment. There is evidence that playing video games could actually be good for us. Some games like Game of Thrones and World of Warcraft are educational and using games certainly can help children learn good qualities. Studies have also shown that the skills used in playing games can cause growth in certain areas of the brain, the ability to think in 3D and even improve our eyesight.\nVideo game players are also no longer just simple creatures. For some, gaming is having a positive effect on their social lives with games like Halo and World of Warcraft often being played in groups. When your group works together to win the game, your sense of achievement is higher than when winning by yourself.\nSo every coin has two sides. It seems today, gaming isn't just for game fans and if used in a proper way, we can all take part. If video games have two sides, what side do you stand by?"

My task is to build fluency and accuracy while providing the opportunity in any writing activity to enhance the moral and emotional development of my students.\nOne great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.\nWriting ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done just like exercise; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise, writing skills improve quickly with writing practice daily. I often see a rise in student confidence and performance after only a few weeks of journal writing.\nExpressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole students. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and emotional lives. They build skills so that some say they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation , or the perfect love letter. That they write in their journals every day puts them a step closer to fluency, eloquence and command of the language."

      "We're surrounded by chemistry in everyday life. Sometimes it is easy to see, like when your science teacher does a big experiment in class. At other times, it can be pretty hard to see everyday chemistry at work, but nearly everything you touch or use has some element of chemistry in it.\nSomething as simple as toothpaste contains at least three chemicals, if not more. It is the mixture of them and its chemical reaction that keeps your teeth clean. Other things you use every day are created by chemistry, such as hair products, shampoo and soap. Adding detergent   to water involves chemistry. Without chemistry, we would never have known that we need soap to get the oil out of clothes or skin. Chemistry not only helps us make products for use, but it also helps us understand the world around us. Chemistry helps us understand what the ozone layer   is and how it protects us.\nChemistry also gives us sunscreen to protect us from the sun. Thanks to chemistry, we know bleach   can't be mixed with vinegar, because it can produce _ gas. Without chemistry, we wouldn't have fireworks displays on important days.\nChemistry plays a big role in food preparation. Cooking food causes it to go through a chemical change. That is why cooked food often tastes different from raw food. Baking is a great example of chemistry. Too much or too little of any ingredient makes a difference to the result of baking, for example, the dough   won't rise or the cake will be flat.\nChemistry isn't something that just lives in a lab; it's something that you meet hundreds of times every day. Knowing how chemistry works will give you a greater understanding of the science behind some of the simplest looking things."

      "Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are a major cause of climate change, and now a new study has confirmed that atmospheric CO2is also affecting the ocean chemistry and potentially harming sea life.\nMontana State University scientist Robert Dore has been researching the water in the Pacific Ocean for almost two decades. We've been going to the same spot in the Pacific Ocean, and we try and characterize long-term change in the open ocean environment. And one of the key things that we measure is CO2levels. And we've been able to record this increasing quantity of atmospheric CO2into the ocean.\nScientists expected that as atmospheric CO2increased, more and more of the carbon dioxide would be absorbed into the ocean, affecting the chemical balance of the sea water, with a potentially harmful impact on shellfish and coral in particular.\n\"As carbon dioxide dissolves  in the water, or seawater in this case, it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid,\" Dore explains. \"And therefore, as the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere goes up and that exchanges with the surface seawater, it drives the PH down, and makes it more acidic.\"\nThe seawater Dore and his colleagues have analyzed confirms what the theory predicts.\nThe effect was particular striking at about 250 meters down, and again at 500 meters. Dore and his colleagues came up with two possible explanations. It could be that surface water picked up CO2and then moved to those depths. Or there could be a biological explanation.\n\"It's important to realize that the oceans are really becoming acidic. And it can have negative  impacts on a whole variety of sea life from fish to coral. It's potentially catastrophic.\""

      "When Danny Wallace, 26, got bored, he put an ad on the worldwide web reading simply: \"Join Me. Send a passport photo.\" A year and a half later his east London flat is the headquarters for a global internet-based \"club\" whose members carry out good deeds for strangers every Friday.\nIt's not common for people in London to talk to strangers. If you see someone struggling with something, part of the brain goes \"I want to help\". But the trained part of the brain says: \"They will think you are mad or going to mug them\", so you walk away.\nJoin Me now has about 3,000 members around the world who do an act of kindness every Friday. For example, I'm usually out on a Friday so I go for one of the standard acts -- the unexpected cup of coffee. You might be sitting in a cafe and see an old man in the corner drinking coffee or tea, and you walk up with another cup of whatever they are drinking , and say: \" I've bought you a coffee\" and walk away. It's a pleasure to see the look of surprise on their faces. There can be some suspicion, but I think that was mostly in the early days when I didn't know how to do it properly. I would walk up quite nervously like I was doing something wrong and I didn't know when to leave. In the end, I learned through _ . Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. I discovered that you have to walk up with confidence and humour and not \"get in their faces\". You say: \"This is for you\", then you go. It's hit-and-run kindness. And there is no point in doing it half-heartedly. You've got to do it because you really mean it.\nJoin Me is without geographical boundaries, but there are quite a few members in London, and such stories about things happen on the underground or on the buses. One lady got on the bus and put a PS10 note down and said: \"That's for me and the next nine people\". So at every stop, anyone who got on was told it was paid for. A lot of people were doing this sort of thing anyway. For them it's an excuse or reason to do something nice for a complete stranger, and it gives them the confidence to walk up and start chatting."

      "Expensive and new gloves allow chatterboxes to take the term \"handsfree\" to a new level--by talking into them as they make a call. The gloves are known as \"Talk to the Hand\" and cost PS1,000 a pair. They fixed a speaker unit into the thumb and a microphone into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth.\nArtist Sean Miles designed the new gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that shows the possibilities of gadget(,) recycling. He uses outdated gloves and combines them with parts from mobile handsets recycled through _ , which commissioned the project. Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking their phones out of their pockets or handbags.\nMr Miles designed two pairs of the new gloves--one in pink and the other in brown and yellow. They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves. If demand is high, they will then be produced on a larger scale. O2 Recycle, which backed the project, estimates that there are already 70 million unused mobile handsets in the UK. The service pays up to PS260 to those who recycle gadgets including phones, handheld consoles, MP3 players and digital cameras.\nDesigner Sean Miles hopes his work will get people thinking about recycling. The 41-year-old said, \"I hope that my 'Talk to the Hand' project will get people to think again about the waste created by not recycling gadgets. If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather than send them to trash, I think this project will have fulfilled its aim.\"\nBill Eyres, head of O2 Recycle, urges people to recycle their phone responsibly. He said, \"There's a pressing need for all of us to look at outdated handsets, and all the gadgets that we move on from or upgrade each year.

      "The United Nations says forty million people or so around the world went hungry in 2008, mainly because of higher food prices. Early estimates  from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that 963 million people did not get enough to eat.\nWorld food prices have dropped since early 2008. Prices of major crops have decreased by more than half from their height earlier last year. But they remain high compared to earlier years.\nBut FAO official Hafez Ghanem says lower prices have failed to end the food crisis   in many poor countries. \"For millions in developing countries,\" he says, \"getting enough food every day to live an active and healthy life is a distant dream.\"\nThe FAO says food shortage is a threat to people's health. Today, two-thirds of the world's _ people live in just a few countries. These are India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and so on.\nA report on food insecurity warns that the current economic crisis could send even more people into hunger and poverty.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of the people who continually go hungry fell from 34% in 1997 to 30% in 2008.

The main reason is the growth in agricultural production in Ghana.\nThe FAO says some countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand and Vietnam have made progress in hunger reduction goals.

      "Juac has made the leap from being an African refugee   to a chess champion in the United States. His job is to share his expertise  with students in schools, chess camps and other events.\nDuring Sudan's civil war in the mid-1980s, Juac was forced out of the country with 20,000 0ther so -called Lost Boys. He fled to Ethiopia, then to Kenya staying in a refugee camp for eight years, where he learned to play chess.\nJuac described a dangerous journey in which half the boys didn't survive. To eat, they had to kill wild animals.\n\"There were animals on the way. It was about a thousand miles and sometimes there was no water. When we were in Ethiopia, we had to cross the river and there a lot drowned.\"\nJuac arrived in the United States in 2004 and began working as a security guard. Winning a chess tournament gave him this teaching opportunity. Juac believes chess helps prepare young people for life.\n\"Some kids are not interested, so it's your job to make them like the game, to explain them what chess is going to help them with.\" He said. \"Like, I can tell, this game will give you patience, and help with your math skills.\"\nJulie Cathone, a second grade teacher in Jackson Public School, agrees. The School's principal, Meghan Kelley, said Juac and chess have made a big difference.\n\"What a role model. I mean when you think about just overcoming, and finding what you love and turning that into your life's work.\"\nJuac said he enjoys the freedom he has in the United States. But his passion is playing and teaching chess to youngsters. His boss, Michael Propper , said Juac has one great advantage.\n\"I think he's believable. I think they look at him and he's so _ that they feel like they can do what he's doing and be a person as he is too.\"\nJu ac still has a big goal ahead of him-becoming an international chess master. With his skill and patience, Propper and his peers have no doubt that will happen."

      "An English saying goes: \" _ \" That means we should relax after a day's hard work or we'll be unhealthy.\nMany students know that if they want to get ideal jobs with good salaries, they must do well in high school so they can enter good universities. Therefore, they spend all day studying without time to relax.\nHowever, not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard. Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences. As a result, students are forces to work harder and harder. Furthermore, there is pressure coming from students themselves. They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce. So, they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day. If they keep it up,   they'll suffer illnesses; both psychological and physical.\nWhat students need is relaxation. This doesn't mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard. It means \"work while you work, play while you play\". If you can do this, you will improve your health greatly. You'll feel yourself suddenly fresh, just like recovering from a terrible illness. You'll find that your studies are not a burden  anymore."

      "Who doesn't love sitting beside a cosy fire on a cold winter's night ? Who doesn't love to watch flames   curling up a chimney? Fire is one of man's greatest friends, but also one of his greatest enemies. Many big fires are caused by carelessness. A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay   can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot   and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That's why farmers cut and store   their hay when it's dry.\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker's shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds' worthy of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside. It has been wisely said that fire is a good servant but a bad master ."

      "Just five one-hundredths of an inch thick, light golden in color1 and with a perfect \"saddle curl,\" the Lay's potato chip seems an unlikely weapon for global domination. But its maker, Frito-Lay, thinks otherwise. \"Potato chips are a snack food for the world,\" said Salman Amin, the company's head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip.\nFrito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in prefix = st1 /Americaowned by PepsiCo and accounts for over half of the parent company's $3 billion annual profits. But theU.S.snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow the company has to look overseas.\nIts strategy rests on two beliefs: first a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete. And second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to \"global\" as a concept. \"Global\" does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones that consumes--especially young people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know that Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company's research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business.\nWith brand perception a crucial  factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo .The logo, along with the company's long-held marketing image of the \"irresistibility\" of its chips would help facilitate the company's global expansion.\nThe executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in America, but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism . Rather, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. \"We're making products in those countries, we're adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,\" said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo's chief executive."

      "When I was 13, my bedroom walls were covered with posters of the Monkees and Beatles. I wrote fan letters and daydreamed about meeting the objects of my affections. I begged my  parents to attend every rock concert and watch every TV show featuring my favorite celebrities; my friends and I discussed for hours all the things we would say and do when we met our favourite movie stars and pop singers. I drove my mother crazy ! But after a few years, my obsession stars faded as I matured and gained the confidence to socialize with \"real\" boys.\nIn the 35 years since I was a teenager, celebrity worship   has increased among teens due to the explosion of television celebrity gossip shows, and instant access to celebrity news on the Internet. It's no wonder that many teens are obsessed with stars when news programs are often filled with entertainment stories and the lives of celebrities.\nCelebrity worship syndrome   is now considered a personality disorder. While it is normal for teenagers to follow the lives of their favorite stars, parents should try to monitor everything their child finds interesting. Parents should take action if they suspect a teen is too obsessed with celebrities and showing little interest in school or withdrawing from the family.  When teens talk a lot about celebrities and view them as just means of entertainment, this is considered normal celebrity worship. However, when a teenager is obsessed with a star and  often expresses a desire to have a close personal relationship with a celebrity or feels they have a special connection to a star, this may be the time for concern. Recent studies have shown that teens who develop an unhealthy obsession with celebrities often suffer from low self confidence and depression. Teens who are overly obsessed with stars often have damaged relationships with their parents."

      "Hubert Joseph Schlafly was an electrical engineer who helped change the way actors, politicians and other people speak on television. In 1950, he and two other men developed the teleprompter. One co-worker, Fred Barton, was an actor. He had an idea for a tool that would help television actors read their lines without having to memorize them. The other co-worker was Irving Kahn. He worked as vice-president of radio and television at 20thCentury Fox.\nThe first teleprompter involved a person who held a long piece of paper printed with big letters. As the actor read the lines, another person would move the paper ahead on the device . The teleprompter was first used on a television program called \"The First Hundred Years.\" Later versions used television screens to show the words that were to be read.\nHub Schlafly and his co-workers believed that many companies would want to buy the teleprompter. So, they left their jobs and created the TelePrompTer Corporation to sell their invention.\nIn 1952, former President Herbert Hoover became the first politician to use a teleprompter. The former president was speaking at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, USA. For a brief time, he stopped reading and began to talk about a subject not written in his speech. When Hoover wanted to continue the speech, the words on the teleprompter were not moving. He then said the machine should be restarted and viewers became aware of the new invention. Many reporters wrote about that incident, creating a new level of publicity for the teleprompter.\nSoon more and more politicians started to use it to face the television camera while reading prepared statements, instead of looking down at their notes. Then the device was used for almost all live television broadcasts."

By the age of 5, the had won fist place in Shenyang's piano competition and performed his first public recital . People were shocked by his perfect performance and thought he was a real talent. From that time on, playing on the global stage became the dream of Lang Lang and his parents.\nTo help him much closer to his dream, when Lang was 9, his father quit his job and went with Lang to Beijing to help his son study piano. There, Lang did not receive the praise that he had received at home, and he experienced the hardest time of his life.   \"I was kicked out of the class by my piano teacher six months later. It totally destroyed my piano dream,\" Lang said in an interview. Hearing of his son's failure, Lang's father was so angry and upset that told Lang Lang to go back to Shenyang. Feeling hopeless and in pain, Lang tried to damage his fingers. He hated piano!\nLuckily, another teacher noticed Lang's sadness and encouraged him. Success came soon. Lang's breakthrough came at age 17, when he gained worldwide fame at a well-known concert in 1999 in Chicago, US."

      "Students usually have two long holidays a year, but have you heard elephants have holidays?\nThe Indian elephants from a temple are sent on a north-long holiday with massages  and baths to relax. The 64 elephants will be fed with a lot of food, enough for them to put on 700~800 pounds.\nA temple veterinarian said that those Indian elephants would be treated after spending a month walking on roads, living on leaves and bananas and giving shows during lots of temple festivals. Their daily diet includes special rice and other special food, which are very _ and can make them healthy and strong. All of these are made by professional people.\nThis treatment will also calm them down ahead of a busy work schedule in upcoming events later in the year where they are the main attractions. The special holiday has cost the temple aboutPS12,500, but extra money is ready for being used to treat the animals.\nIndians believe that doing something good to elephants can help them get wisdom and power. Having elephants is a traditional symbol of honor for temples across southern India. All temples, however, never buy their elephants. The elephants were donated by people."

      "Some people collect stamps. Other people collect works of art or musical instruments. But a man in the American state of Maryland collects secrets.\nFor the past 10 years, people have been sending Frank Warren postcards and other objects with secrets written on them. He now has a million secrets. \"It's a drawing of a lift. And the secret says: 'I feel guilty when I take lifts for one floor, so I limp when I get out.'\" Frank said.\nTen years ago, Mr. Warren created an art project called PostSecret. People then began to send him postcards, other objects and emails telling their secrets. Every Sunday, he chooses 10 secrets and puts them on the website.\nMr. Warren says he created PostSecret so people could share their secrets in a safe place. \"I was struggling with secrets in my own life. And it was by creating this safe place where others could share their secrets with me, I think that space was something I needed just as much as they did.\"\nHe has published six books full of the secrets people have shared with him. One secret in each book is his. Eric Perry delivers mail for the U.S. Postal Service. He has brought thousands of secrets to Frank's home over the past three years. \"I have a couple of the books that Frank's given me and I've read them all and my family has read them all and it's wild!\"\nThe project itself was once one of Frank's secrets. His wife Jan didn't know exactly what he was doing until the first book was published. The publisher told him that the address was going to be on the book, and he refused. However, the address was there just because of the contract between them. Actually Warren wasn't very happy about that.\nSome people tell Frank of their secret desire to kill themselves. So he and the PostSecret community have raised more than $1 million to help prevent suicides ."

To make our life colorful and relax ourselves, in July, my friend and I are taking a camping trip. We will travel for four weeks and will tour the United States and part of Canada. We have decided to camp because it does not cost as much as vacationing   in hotels.\nWe have to plan very carefully in advance. First, the car we are going to drive is very small, so we have decided to take only one small suitcase each and as few camping things as possible. We will take some medicine with us to prevent insects   from hurting us, and also food for picnics. Second, there is a lot to see in the United States and Canada, so we have to decide on the direction   we want to drive.\nThe date we are leaving is July 2, from which day we will have two months off.  We want to see and do many things on our camping tour. We want to climb in the mountains, visit famous caves, and swim in cool mountain rivers. We want to visit many cities and talk to many people, which I am sure can enrich our experience greatly. We also want to find a hotel room if it rains at night. We expect to have an exciting trip."

      "Individuality is the particular character, or aggregate (total) of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others. Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed  .\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\nShe was as exciting and eccentric   in her personal life as in her dance."

      "Medicine comes in lots of different packages. Painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away. Antibiotic cream   from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. But can medicine come packaged in chicken eggs?\nA team of scientists from Scotland say \"yes\". They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside.\nThese eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins . Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates   for making protein drugs.\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis  .\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs."

      "There have been many great inventions, which have changed the way we live. The first great invention was one that is still very important today---the wheel. This made it easier to carry heavy things to travel long distances. For hundreds of years there were few inventions that have made as much effect as the wheel. There was little unknown land left in the world. People didn't have to explore  much any more. They began to work to make life better instead.\nIn the second half of the 19th century many great inventions were made. Among them were the camera, the electric light and the radio. These all became a big part of our life today. The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Sound movies in 1926. The computer in 1928, and jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was made. Nylon came out in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear. The middle part of the 20th brought new ways to help people get over diseases. They worked very well. They made people healthier and let them live long lives. By the 1960s most people could expect to live to be at least 60. By this time most people had a very good life. Of course new inventions continued to be made. But man now had a wish to explore again. The world is known to man but the stars are not yet. Man began looking for ways to go into space. Russia made the first step. Then the United States took a step. Since then other countries, including China and Japan, have made their steps into space."

      "If there is a building which symbolizes a country--such as the Eiffel Tower for France and Sydney Opera House for Australia--then it has to be the Taj Mahal for India.\nIt was set up by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1653 in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. From the time they got married, they wouldn't be separated. She followed him to wars, advised him on affairs of state, and was loved by his people for her good work. But she died in 1631 during childbirth. The emperor was heart-broken and had the Taj Mahal built as a sign of his love.\nIt took more than 20 years for the Taj Mahal to be built. Workers were brought in, not only from all over India, but from Central Asia too. A total of 20,000 people worked on the building.\nIn 1657, Shah Jahan fell ill, and in 1658 his son Aurangzeb, imprisoned   his father and seized power. Shah Jahan stayed in prison until his death in 1666. He was finally buried there with his wife he could never forget.\nThe Taj Mahal is definitely worth more than a single visit. As it is built with white marble stones, its character changes in different lights. It looks more beautiful at sunrise and sunset. At sunset, for example, the colour of the Taj changes from white to yellow, then to pink. As the moon rises, it turns a silvery white.\nTo show respect to the Taj, tourists are asked to take off their shoes during their visit."

      "When someone meets a stranger with the same hobby, that person immediately becomes a friend. People enjoy the company of others who share a similar interest. Often they will form a club and travel great distances to attend meetings where they can talk about their hobbies. Other people have such unusual hobbies that no one else can share them. Sometimes they try to do something better, faster or longer than anyone else in order to have their names included in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nA lady in Massachusetts may have the world's easiest hobby; she let her hair grow. Diane Witt has not cut her hair for twelve years. It is now eight feet (2.44 meters) long, and she will soon set a new world record and her name will be placed in the Guinness Book. A thirty-year-old man in Pennsylvania played the piano for forty-five days and eleven hours, while a musician in Connecticut played the flute for forty-three hours.\nA teacher in California typed for over 162 hours, and a lady from Iowa spend six years typing the numbers from one to one million. Probably the cleanest people in the world are two young women from England who stayed in the shower for over ninety-eight hours; but a man in Oregon was more than twice as clean after taking a shower that lasted two hundred hours.\nSomeone said that \"records are made to be broken\". One record that many young men might enjoy breaking is the one made by Roger Guy English of California. During a period of eight hours Roger kissed three thousand young women."

      "Dear son,\nThe day that you see me old and I am already not in good health, have patience and try to understand me.\nIf I get dirty when eating, if I can not dress, have patience and remember the hours I spent teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I repeat the same things thousand and one times, do not interrupt me, listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you thousand and one times the same story until you got to sleep. When I do not want to have a shower, neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with thousand excuses I invented, in order that you wanted to breathe. When you see my knowing little about new technologies, give me the necessary time and do not look at me with your mocking  smile. I taught you how to do so many things: to eat good, to dress well, to confront life... When at some moment I lose the memory or the thread of our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember, and if I cannot do it, do not become nervous, as the most important thing is not our conversation but surely to be with you and to have you listening to me.\nIf ever I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well when I need to and when not. When my tired legs do not allow me to walk, give me your hand, the same way I did when you made your first step. And when someday I say to you that I do not want to live anymore--that I want to rest forever, do not get angry. Someday you will understand.\nTry to understand that _ . Some day you will discover that, despite my mistakes, I always wanted the best thing for you and that I tried to prepare the way for you. You must not feel sad, angry or impotent for seeing me near you. You must be next to me, try to understand me and to help me as I did it when you starting living. I will pay you by a smile and by the immense love I have had always for you."

      "Every language has its own special words and expressions. And a story can be told about each of them. \"Hot\" is a simple, easily-understood word. So are most of the expressions made with the word \"hot\".  But not always, as we shall see. \nTake the phrase \"hot potato\" for example. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire. Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand. It would be difficult, even painful, to do so. One such hot potato is taxes. Calling for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician. And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut, which can also make a politician very unpopular. \nAnother expression is \"not so hot\". If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: \"Not so hot. \" What she means is that she does not feel well. \"Not so hot\" is also a way of saying that you do not really like something. \n\"A hot shot\" is a person, often a young person, who thinks he can do anything. At least he wants to try. He is very sure he can succeed. But often he fails. The expression came from the army. A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully.\nA person who becomes angry easily is called \"a hothead\". An angry person's neck often becomes red. We say he is \"hot under the collar\". You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio. \nThe hot line was a direct communication link between the leaders of the Soviet Union  and the United States. The hot line had an important purpose: to prevent accidental war between the two competitors during the period known as the Cold War. The American president and the Soviet leader were able to communicate directly and immediately on the hot line."

      "It is not a secret that these are _ times that put everyone on edge all the time and it makes people angry with their families, co-workers, friends and relatives, frustrated  and highly annoyed just for the noise of the neighbors or the music coming from the opposite house. Anger and negative energy have a strong influence on everyone's life, even when they don't realize it.\nBeing in a calm state of mind is simply wonderful. Results of this can be seen when parents no longer shout at their children over any small thing and when one can keep him cool when bad things happen and doesn't let the situation become worse by his negative influence.\nAlso results can be seen on a larger scale. In 1993 a very interesting scientific experiment called The US Transcendental Meditation experiment was conducted in Washington. A company called TM got 4,000 calm and relaxed people to simply sit and meditate   in a central Washington convention center. The results of this experiment showed that during those particular 8 weeks, violent crimes, such as murder, rape, assaults, clearly decreased by as much as 23%.\nThis is evident proof that meditation can change the state of mind, bring back peace of mind and collective meditation is contagious  , just as anything done collectively is contagious. For example, a person has the urge to become aggressive (while in normal circumstances that person is very calm and normal), just because he is sitting at a stadium watching a football game and everyone around is shouting and is aggressive.\nIsn't increasing the quality of life worth spending 20 minutes of time on meditation? Yes, very few people follow through with a meditation method that should be a joy to do. Many start and leave it after only a few sessions.\nSo if collective meditation has proven that meditation works, that it calms people down and that it brings their levels of stress down, why not employ it in everyday life?"

The report also confirmed evidence that the level of carbon dioxide in increasing.\n       The best information about climate in the past comes from tests of ice many kilometers deep in Antarctica and Greenland .These tests show that levels of carbon dioxide today are the highest ever measured .These findings have led scientists to believe that carbon dioxide is a major cause of climate warming.\n       Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when fuel is burned. Oil ,coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas .When biological waste breaks down ,it also releases carbon dioxide.\n       However ,plants use carbon dioxide in the process called photosynthesis. This process provides food for almost all life on Earth. Some groups that support burning oil and coal want to increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . They oppose international efforts to control carbon dioxide.\n       Some scientists believe that forests and trees are able to capture large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. Some groups even suggest that an increase in carbon dioxide could cause plants to grow faster.\n       A recent study inNorth Carolinafound that more carbon dioxide in the air could cause trees to grow faster .But the researchers found the effect appears to last for only three years. Another study showed that much of the carbon dioxide that is taken in by trees in released within three years. The study noted that leaves released carbon dioxide when they fall from trees and break down in the soil. Plants also naturally release carbon dioxide  through the process of respiration."

      "Child labor -- the employment of children in industry, often against their will -- has been a problem for many years. Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined(limited)to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.\nGirls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to the health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending school. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work.\nThe solution to the problem of child labor is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws. Only in this way can young boys and girls be allowed to enjoy the most valuable time of their lives--childhood."

      "When we say older people shrink, we don't mean they become tiny enough to fit in your pocket! We just mean that it's common for older people to become a little shorter over time. This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?\nBecause of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.\nAnother reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.\nOlder people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .\nDid you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though. Once you get a good night's rest, your body recovers, and the next morning, you're standing tall again!\nSmoking and drinking alcohol can make this problem worse. Want to do something right now to build strong bones? I believe what I will say will help you."

      "Do you find getting up in the morning so difficult that it's painful ? This might be called laziness, but Dr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle.\nDuring the hours when you labour through your work you may say that you're \"hot\". That's true. The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak . For some people the peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening No one has discovered why this is so , but it leads to such familiar monologues  as : \"Get up, John! You'll be late for work again !\" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and -energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has.\nYou can't change your energy cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. Habit can help, Dr. Kleitman believes . Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway . Counteract(/)your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to .If your energy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual hour. This won't change your cycle, but you'll get up steam and work better at your low point.\nGet off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a leisurely yawn and stretch . Sit on the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor . Avoid the troublesome search for clean clothes by laying them out the night before. Whenever possible, do routine work in the afternoon and save tasks requiring more energy or concentration for your sharper hours."

Three eras left their mark on the former residence of the Habsburgs: the Middle Ages with Gothic St. Stephen's Cathedral whose spire points toward heaven, one of Vienna's landmarks; the Baroque whose most important achievement is the Imperial Palace with its sumptuous cupolas  . And the Ring Boulevard era of the late nineteenth century, when such splendid buildings as the Vienna State Opera and the Museum of Fine Arts were built to replace the former city walls.\nThe _ of the center of Vienna is enhanced   by numerous churches, mansions and parks, as well as by rich art collections gathered by wealthy rulers. And the centuries-old musical tradition ranges from the Court Chapel of the Imperial Palace to Mozart's immortal   music and the waltzes of Johann Strauss.

      "After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be\n, so mostly I just lied a lot to appear to be skilled at dealing with people. At least I never needed the map.\nOne girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she gossiped about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up.\nWe sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from England Eric, waved at me from across the room.\nIt was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them.\nThey were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't staring at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an over interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught and held my attention.\nI stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all extremely, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine, or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful -- maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy."

      "For some people, the prospect of starting college, especially going away to school, is scary. It's probably the first time that you'll be totally responsible for your own schedule. What if you intend to go to college but just don't feel ready to start yet-for whatever reason-and you don't want to take on a full-time job after graduation? You might want to take a year off to pause and regroup. This practice is common in some countries, like the United Kingdom, where it's called a \" _ \".\nTaking time off doesn't mean you should ignore the idea of applying to college. In fact, you may want to consider making your college plans before you become involved in other things, especially if you'll be travelling. Apply to schools and make your choice, then ask for a deferred admission. Rachel took a year off and worked in New York City between college and medical school. She says that she had to be extremely well organized about planning for medical school so she didn't miss any of her deadlines. \"Not only did I have to apply to schools and make plans to take my MCAT exams, I also had to make all my living arrangements and other plans for my year off!\"\nEven if you decide not to apply to college, it can be a great idea to take a year to do something you may not have an opportunity to do again.

Already she was the first woman to swim the English Channel in both directions. Now, at age 34,her goal was to become the first woman to swim from Catalina Island to the California coast.\nOn that fourth of July morning in 1952,the sea was like an ice bath and the fog was so thick that she could hardly see her support boats. Sharks swam toward her lone figure, only to be driven away by rifle shots. Against the frigid grip of the sea, she struggled on--hour after hour--while millions watched on national television.\nAlongside Florence in one of the boats , her mother and her trainer offered encouragement. They told her it wasn't much farther. But all she could see was fog. They urged her not to give up.  _ With only a half mile to go, she asked to be pulled out.\nStill thawing her chilled body several hours later, she told a reporter,\" Look, I'm not excusing myself, but if I could have seen land I might have made it.\" It was not fatigue or even the cold water that defeated her .It was the fog. She was unable to see her goal.\nTwo months later, she tried again. This time ,despite the same dense fog, she swam with her faith intact and her goal clearly pictured in her mind. She knew that somewhere behind that fog was land and this time she made it! Florence Chadwick became the first woman to swim the Catalina Channel, eclipsing the men's record by two hours!"

      "The U.S. Department of Labor statistics  show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree.\nOn the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen.\nThe reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments  go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them.\nOne result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up."

      "A new international study shows that some people's biological clock plays a powerful role for their life expectancy, regardless of lifestyle choices.\nPublished in the latest issue ofAgingon Wednesday, the study has found the most definitive evidence to explain why some people keep healthy lifestyle but die younger than others.\nGeneticist Steve Horvath from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), led a team of 65 scientists around the world to record age-related changes to human DNA, analyse blood samples collected from 13, 000 people and estimate their lifespan.\nA higher biological age, regardless of actual age, consistently predicts an earlier death, the study says.\n\"You get people who are vegan, sleep 10 hours a day, have a low-stress job, and still end up dying young,\" Horvath said in a statement. \"We have shown some people have a faster innate aging rate.\"\nThe findings discovered that 5 percent of the population ages at a faster biological rate, which translated to a roughly 50 percent higher than average risk of death at any age.\n\"The great hope is that we find anti-aging interventions that would slow your innate aging rate,\" Horvath said, adding that \"this is an important milestone to realizing this dream.\""

      "Harry potter and The Hunger Games haven't been big hits for nothing. Lots of teens still read quite a lot. But a study shows a clear decrease over time. Nearly half of 17-year-olds say they read for pleasure no more than one or two times a year. That's way down from ten years ago.\nThe digital revolution   means there are more platforms   than ever to read on. Jim Steyer has been studying the effect of technology on children. He has four kids and has seen the trend most with his 16-year-old. \"I start to see it in our 10-year-old as well, because he is reading less and less, and more and more attracted to some of the digital media platforms that he has access to, and that he didn't have access to when he was 6 or 7 years old,\" he says.\nThe studies don't say that kids are reading less because they're spending more time online. But Steyer is convinced that's at least part of the answer.\n\"First of all, most children now have access to e-readers, or other smart electronic devices like phones and tablets  ,\" he says. \" And they're spending time on that. Many reports show the increasing use of new technology platforms by kids. It just strikes me as extremely logical that that's a big reason.\nResearchers want to know more about how teens are spending their time in the digital age. But Kathryn Zickuhr of the Pew Research Center says it's tricky. If a kid is looking at a book, you may think he or she is reading. But when it comes to looking at a smartphone or tablet, who knows?\n\"We've heard from middle and high school teachers that sometimes the Internet is wonderful for enthusiastic students to do deep research,\" says Zickuhr. \"But on the other side, obviously there are many distractions on the Internet.\"\nHowever, Jim Steyer says, \"Kids with parents who read, who buy or take books out of the library for their kids, and who then set time aside in their kids' daily schedule for reading, tend to read the most -- whether it's on a book, an e-book or some other devices.\""

      "Dutch treat is a late-nineteenth-century term, and it originally refers to a dinner where everyone is expected to pay for his own share of the food and drink. If people go \"Dutch treat\", or simply \"go Dutch\", it means that they will share the expenses of a social engagement.\nThere are many other \"Dutch\" expressions in English, many of which were invented in Britain in the seventeenth century, when the Dutch and the English were commercial and military rivals. The British used \"Dutch\" to refer to something bad, cheap and shameful. A \"Dutch bargain\" at that time was an uneven, one-sided deal; \"Dutch reckoning\" was an unitemized  account; and \"Dutch widow\" was slang for prostitute. Later centuries brought in \"Dutch courage\", for bravery caused by drink; \"Dutch concert\", for noisy music; \"Dutch nightingale\", meaning a frog; and \"double Dutch\", for incomprehensible language or talk.\nSome of the expressions are still in use today, but some are not. In fact, in American English, some \"Dutch\" expressions have nothing to do with the Dutch, but something with the German. It was probably because of the similar spelling and pronunciation that people made a mistake in distinguishing between \"Dutch\" and \"Deutsch\" (the German word for German), when German immigrants came to America in the 1700s. For instance, \"the Pennsylvania Dutch\" refers to the German descendants, instead of the Dutch descendants, living in Pennsylvania."

      "Crazy is our new normal. With two teenage boys and three little boys, our family is restless--to the baseball field, track field and piano lessons. Even though we've limited each boy's activities and try our best to defend our family time, it seems that we're in a constant state of flight.\n\"Embrace it. Roll with it,\" my husband, Lonny, says, \"It's going to be like this for a while.\"\nHe is right. It's likely that life will continue to go forward before it slows down. But I remembered the still, quiet days that our family used to enjoy. I missed long walks through the park when we held the boys' little hands. I longed for  lazy Saturday afternoons under the tree in our backyard. I wanted to slip back a few years, when busyness was the exception and not the rule.\nOne night, after a particularly full day and evening games, our family gathered on the porch for ice cream. Two parents, two teens, and three small boys piled on one old swing and a couple of rocking chairs. We were together, in one place, for a small slice of time.\nThe moon was full. The Mississippi River, flowing past our home, was smooth as glass. I wrapped my own arms around the son who sat on my lap and breathed deeply to _ his little-boy scent --dirt and sweat. My heart was still and content .\nI realized that while crazy is our new normal happiness is as usual. They may look different from before, but they are still there--even if they're in the form of a single moment on the porch. Maybe I just need the eyes to see."

      "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they're always getting criticism. Their critics seem to resent(...) them because they have a gift for self-promotion and because they have so much money to throw around. 'It's unjust,' they say, 'that this entirely unproductive industry (if we can call it that) should absorb millions of pounds each year. It only goes to show how much profit the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...'\nThe poor old consumer! He'd have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to inform. A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine, it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc., from an advertisement.\nLots of people pretend that they never read advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws  while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only closely printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration  of disasters.\nWe must not forget, either, that advertising makes a positive contribution to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies could not survive without this source of revenue . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price!\nAnother thing we mustn't forget is the 'small ads.' which are in virtually every newspaper and magazine.  What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community! Just about anything can be accomplished through these columns. For instance, you can find a job, buy or sell a house, announce a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the 'hatch(giving birth), match and dispatch' column but by far the most fascinating section is the personal or 'agony' column . No other item in a newspaper provides such entertaining reading or offers such a deep insight into human nature. It's the best advertisement for advertising there is!"

      "In the market of luxury   brands, Chinese consumers are only second to the Japanese in the world.\nAcross the globe it's clear that the young generation are increasingly relying on expensive brands for their self-image.\nPersonally I am a fashion-lover, at least in spirit. I love to look at clothes and shoes. But I don't understand why people spend large amounts of money on designer labels. Certainly, young people, whether in China or elsewhere, should be building their self-confidence in other ways. When a young woman shows off a handbag worth two months' salary, that's a scary thing.\nWhat are the psychological factors forcing young people to take on debt for designer items?\nThe desire to say, \"Hey, look at me. I'm wealthy. I have social status.\"\nScientists have found the acquisition of luxury brands doesn't lead to happiness. Study after study has shown that, although we are born to desire material possessions, when we get them, we don't suddenly become \"happy people\".\nIn fact, a series of studies by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, US, have shown that individuals who invest   in travel and other experiences get more pleasure than those who invest in material things. That's because experiences are more easily combined into a person's identity. If I travel to Yunnan, that adventure affects how I think. My memories entertain my friends and colleagues. It follows, then, that investing in experiences improves my chances for successful social relationships.\nMoreover, as Van Boven has observed, young people who pursue happiness through \"things\" are liked less by others than young people who seek happiness through experiences. \nThis research is pretty solid, but I suspect it won't persuade young people not to desire a style. It's natural to want to express yourself through your appearance. So my advice is, create a look that isn't tied to a designer label. \nYou don't have to  _ to send a message about who you are. Take a trip. Go out into the world. Then come back and confidently create your own signature look."

      "Recently educators have been questioning \"prep school\" (=preparatory school)   where barely literate   high school athletes get their transcripts   by taking courses occasionally and sometimes by taking no courses at all. The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.\nThe prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit   students who do not meet academic standard.\nThe prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation--at which point their grade-point averages would be written in stone--to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records.\nThe N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.\nThese measures are encouraging as far as they go. But the N.C.A.A. will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme. For starters, it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports, but when they should take them. Until that happens, those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic record at the last possible moment for them."

Repeat 12 to 15 times per minute.\nBurns\nWash the burn immediately with large amounts of cool, running water. Apply an ice pack for 15--20 minutes. Do not place an ice pack directly on the skin.

      "After 10 seasons wearing the No.8 on his back, Kobe Bryant will become No.24 next season. The reason for the surprising decision by the Los Angeles Lakers super guard last week has become a hot topic for debate. \nBryant wore No.24 when he was in early high school, but he changed to No.33 in his senior year. He switched to No.8 when he was selected by the Lakers in 1996, and has been not changed since. \nBryant has refused to explain the decision until the end of the play-offs. So guessing Bryant's motive has become a popular game among NBA fans and newspaper columnists. \nThere are all kinds of speculations . Many say that Bryant wants to leave the past behind and have a fresh start. He has often been criticized for playing to benefit himself and not the team as a whole. Others say that he may be trying to compare himself to Michael Jordan. prefix = st1 /Jordanwas famous for his No. 23 jersey . Some, such as NBC Sport columnist Michael Ventre, argue that it is \"all about money\". Bryant will make more money by selling new jerseyto his fans. \nSome speculations are more about fun. For example, there is an opinion that Kobeis actually just a diehard fan of the popular TV drama \"24\". \nAll this talk has turned the number change into a major issue. It seems that there is a lot of fuss over something that should be pretty simple. \nJersey numbers have their own special significance in American sports, especially basketball. Players choose their number when they join a team and they usually stick with that number for the rest of their career. When a great player retires, his team will honor him by retiring his number."

      "Iceland, an island just south of the Arctic Circle, has fairly mild winters,  thanks to warm ocean currents. Time your vacation here during the winter months to take advantage of off-season deals.\nOff-season means good deals on flights, hotels and tours. You may also find that the locals are a bit friendlier and more welcoming when tourists aren't arriving in crowds.\nIn the winter months, there are less than seven hours of daylight; thus, chances are good you'll catch sight of the northern lights. Sunsets are also beautiful at this time, making for some great photo opportunities.\nIn Iceland, winter is the perfect time to hike glaciers, go ice climbing, explore caves made out of hardened lava  and much more. One of the most popular activities is off-roading  in a specially-equipped \"super jeep\".\nBefore booking your trip, be sure to check for volcano alerts. There are about 130 volcanoes on or around Iceland. Thirty-five of them are active. In 2010, a volcano named Eyjaallajokull exploded, sending clouds of ash up to four kilometers into the atmosphere. The ash drifted toward the UK and Europe. Because the ask could damage aircraft engines, airlines operating in the region were forced to cancel flights for six days. As a result, thousands of people were stuck in airports.\nRecently, another volcano named Bardarbunga has become active, erupting ash into the air. Such events, if large enough, could prevent your trip from going ahead. So check the latest volcano news prior to making your reservations."

      "You may have heard of the book Moby Dick(<<>> ), written by the American author Herman Melville. You may also know that Moby Dick is considered one of the greatest novels ever written. However, it might surprise you to find out Herman Melville was not always a highly regarded author.\nMelville's first two novels, Typee and Omoo, were widely read and financially successfully. They were both exciting tales of adventures at sea and experiences with people in foreign lands. Melville became quite famous. However, upon the publication of his third book, Mardi, Melville's popularity began to weaken. He was no longer interested in telling tales of pure adventure, and his writing took on a style that alienated  the general reading public of his time.\nMelville published Moby Dick in October of 1851. it was an original novel, combining aspects of sociology and philosophy, which confused readers by its complex symbolism. The book sold poorly.\nMelville's next book, Pierre, was almost completely disregarded by the public. Debt frustration and ill health finally forced Melville to take a low-paying job as a customs inspector. Eventually, Melville abandoned prose  and began to write poetry.\nThe Civil War is the main subject of Melville's poetry. He and his brother made a trip to the front line, and he published a book of poems, Battle-Pieces and Aspects of War, based on this experience.\nMelville died in 1891 at the age of 72. at this point, his work had been completely forgotten by the public. His talent was to go unrecognized for the next thirty years. Then, in 1920s, his reputation began to improve as critics and readers rediscovered his work. Today Moby Dick is one of the best-known novels ever penned by an American author."

      "Are you having too much salt? You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.\nWhat problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.\nSalt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.\nBut past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.\nIf you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:\n*Cut back on high salt foods.\nMost foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.\n*Choose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.\nBread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products. And always try to choose the ones lower in salt.\n*Avoid adding salt to cooking and at table. Instead, you could use herbs and spices   such as garlic   and lemon juice to add flavor to meals."

      "Most young people enjoy some forms of physical activities. It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skill and less wasted effort, and they certainly experience enjoyment."

      "Now that America has declared a state of swine flu   public health emergency, you may be asking yourself -- what am Isupposed to do? Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family.\n1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea   and diarrhea  . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure   either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. \n2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in.\n3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. \n4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose. \n5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can.\n6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home.\n7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs."

      "In 1905, as part of his Special Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein published the point that a large amount of energy could be released from a small amount of matter. This was expressed by the equation E = mc2. But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he would \"refuse to do war service, direct or indirect....\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler's coming into power in Germany.\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein's signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in. \nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life...when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification---the danger that the Germans would make them?"

      "When my son was just learning to talk, I carried him around the house in my arms and pointed out things to him. \"Look, David, a clock. \"He'd smile and point as I did and say \"clock\". David was quick at connecting the shape of things to their words.\nWhen my son was about four years old, I walked with him to the backyard. I knew that there was an ant colony under one of the slate stones in the walkway near the shed, so I said to David, \"Come on. I want to show you something. \"\nAs I showed David the ants that were crawling around the slate stone, he crouched down on his legs and looked with great intensity at the ants.\nFor days after that, David wanted to look under every rock in the garden, and we often found worms, ants and so on. I recognized that David loved to look at things closely and observe how things moved, and so I continued to point things out to him as he grew older: planes, cars, shells etc. . David was a keen observer, and I just gave him the suggestions as to where to look.\nToday David is a medical doctor at Columbia University Center. I did not know that David would someday be a doctor, someone who has to pay close attention to what he sees, and yet I felt compelled when he was a boy to encourage his enthusiasm for observation.\nThat is what teachers and parents do: encourage a child's enthusiasm for a particular interest: music, swimming, art, reading. And we provide tools for the children. If a child likes to draw, give him brushes, pens, and paper. If a girl likes to tap on the table top, give her a drum. If a child wants to sing, give him a microphone and a Frank Sinatra recording."

It shouldn't be treated as a cheap joke for foreign tourists to laugh at but as a cultural treasure,\" said the 32-year-old multimedia designer, who frequently visited China for almost a decade before moving to Beijing in 2007.\n\"I'm trying to challenge the idea that there is only one type of standard English -- the English that's spoken in America or in the British Isles -- which is shortsighted, because Chinglish is already being used by millions of people to communicate with one another.\"\nSo, since 2005, he has collected more than 5,000 examples of \"the wonderful results of an English dictionary meeting Chinese grammar\" on his website www.chinglish.de and has published two books on the subject.\n\"The two books are unique in that they talk about the academic value of Chinglish, the creative combination of English and Chinese, and why we should keep it,\" Radtke said.\nPatricia Schetelig, who works for the German Embassy in Beijing and regularly contributes to www.chinglish.de, said she appreciates Radtke's approach to Chinglish.\n\"What's important to me is that he's not making fun of the way things are translated,\" said she. \"There are other websites doing similar things, but they're making fun of Chinglish or saying it shouldn't be done this way.\"\nPart of his mission, Radtke said, is to conserve rapidly disappearing Chinglish examples.\nHe was disappointed while watching the government replace Chinglish signs with standard English ones in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. \"That was a sad day for me and a sad day for Chinglish,\" Radtke said.\nBut American David Tool, who has been closely involved in cleaning up Chinglish in Beijing since 2001, disagreed.\n\"Chinglish takes away from the aesthetic  , educational and cultural value we want these signs to provide,\" said Tool, \"We get distracted when we're trying to explain something. It's not dealing with the issues with respect.\""

      "The latest fashion in kitchen is the food steamer. All the stores are selling them; everyone wants one. Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However, that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods. In case you're thinking of buying a steamer, I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best.\n*Folding Steamer\nThe simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel  version.\nAdvantages: This is a good, basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of pans with the water under it; a ring in the center allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean.\nDisadvantages: It only holds small dishes. Also, if you put too much water in the pan, it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery. If you put too little water in and let it get dry, you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables.\n*Steaming Pan\nThis is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled steamers, which sits on the oven ring. The brand I bought is called Nutritious Living.\nAdvantages: This is an excellent steamer, lightweight, easy to clean, and of all the steamers I've tried, this cooks the fastest. Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top. It's easier to store.\nDisadvantages: Water can boil away until the pan is dry, but if you make sure you fill the pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food, this should not happen.You cannot see the food cooking from the top. It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice.\nFor serious users of steamers, I recommend having one of each version. If you just want to try it, get the folding stainless-steel type."

      "Narasimha Das is on his way to feed 169,379 hungry children. Das is in charge of a kitchen in Vrindaban. The town is about a three-hour drive from India's capital, New Delhi. Das gets to work at 3:00 a.m. Thirty workers are already working to make tens of thousands of rounds of bread. It will be brought to 1,516 schools in and around Vrindaban.\nA Growing Problem\nGoing to school is difficult for more than 13 million children in India. They must go to work instead, or go hungry. That's why India began the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the largest school-lunch program in the world. A free lunch encourages children to come to school and gives them the energy they need for learning. The program began in the 1960s.\nThe kitchen in Vrindaban is run by the Akshaya Patra Foundation. It is one of the lunch program's biggest partners. \"Just $11.50 can feed one child for an entire year,\" said Madhu Sridhar, president of the Akshaya Patra Foundation.\nLunch Is Served!\nThe Akshaya Patra food truck arrives at Gopalgarh Primary School. Since the program started, the number of underweight children has gone down. The children get foods they need -- as long as they finish what's on their plates."

      "College visits are important.Before you commit years of your life and money to a school, be sure you're choosing a place,\" that is a good match for your personality and interests.You can't get the \"feel' of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus.Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit.\n1.Explore on your own\nOf course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to hang around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school's selling points.But the 1dest and prettiest buildings don't give you the entire picture of a college.Try to walk the extra mile and get the complete picture of the campus.\n2.Read the Bulletin Boards\nWhen you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence hall, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards.They provide an easy way to see what's happening on campus.The ads for lectures, clubs and plays can tell you what's going on outside the classrooms.\n3.Eat in the Dining Hall\nYou can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall.Try to sit with students if you can.Do the students seem happy or stressed? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admission offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n4.Visit a Class in Your Major\nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense.You'll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are  in classroom discussion.Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major.Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit--most colleges don't allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n5.Talk to Lots of Students\nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the sch001.Try to talk to students who aren't getting paid to impress you.These important conversations can often provide you with information about co1lege life that isn't part of the admission script.Few university officials wi11 tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random(,) students might.\nFor more tips,please go to collegeapps.about.com."

      "Sometimes it is difficult to talk to taxi drivers. They must give all their attention to the road as they work out the shortest way to the place where you are going. However, passengers from Wangfujing were in surprise when they took a taxi. The driver just would not stop talking - in English.\nOrganized by the Cultural and Education Section of the British Embassy, \"Dare to Speak\" examines if Chinese people will speak English in \"real-life\" situations.\nMatthew Knowles, an acting student from South Carolina at Beijing Film Academy, acted the part as the \"driver\". He collected six passengers on Saturday morning, most of whom were female white-collar  workers.\n\"Of course they were surprised at first, wondering why I'm driving a taxi, and wondering whether this is a real taxi, but then most of them were pretty willing to speak,\" he said. Knowles said he was also surprised by his \"passengers\". \"Apart from my first 'passenger', who could speak very little English, all the rest spoke English very well, and it was fun to communicate with them,\" he said, adding that some \"passengers\" were quite talkative.\nThe \"foreign taxi driver\" project was just one of the \"Dare to Speak\" activities, which have been going on since the end of October. Other projects included a foreign store owner near a high school in Beijing, a cook in a Shanghai university canteen. They were testing the willingness of Chinese people, especially students and white-collar workers, to speak to foreigners in English.\nRong Xin, senior manager of IELTS   with the British Embassy, said they hoped to let IELTS takers in China know that communication is the _ goal of IELTS.\n\"We hope that more and more IELTS takers in China can realize the importance of communicating in English in real life, instead of just getting high test scores,\" she said."

      "For almost two months Dominic York, a 23-year-old hairdresser, wandered about hospitals all night, wearing a white coat and pretending he was a doctor. Yesterday he proudly claimed in court that despite his complete lack of medical experience or qualifications, he had saved several people's lives. He had even been allowed to assist a surgeon during an emergency operation on a patient who was about to die on something she had swallowed.\n\"I watched one of those TV dramas about a hospital and suddenly I felt like playing one of the roles myself. So I put on a white jacket and a stethoscope and walked around one of the biggest hospital in London. At first I just watched. Once you learn how doctors talk to patients, nurses and others doctors, it's easy to take people in,\" he said.\nOne of the patients he treated was Laura Kennan. She had been knocked down by a car and fainted. When she came to in hospital, York was standing over her.\n\"He looked very professional. He told me his name was Doctor Simon. Then he gave me some sort of injection,\" she said. And then he suddenly cleared off when a nurse asked who he was. She didn't think there was anything wrong. \"I would never have realized he was a fake if a policewoman hadn't showed me his photograph a week later. When the policewoman told me who he really was, I could hardly believe my ears.\"\nJudge Raymond Adams told York that he was \" shocked and horrified\" that he got away with his deceiving for so long. And they sentenced him to eighteen months in a special prison for criminal with mental disorders.\n\"I can only hope that this will not lead to further problems. After all, you will have considerable opportunity to study the behaviour of the psychiatrists who will look after you while you are there. If you try to persuade people that you yourself are a psychiatrist after you are set free, I shall make sure that you are given a much longer sentence.\" Judge Adams warned York."

      "Now I know that we black people are much more likely to have high blood pressure and diabetes  than white people. And _ often lead to heart attacks and other untreated diseases. For example, black people are three to four times more likely than white people to have high blood pressure and twice as likely as the white population to die of a stroke .\nNew research has found out the surprisingly high levels of salt in many of black people's favorite meals. I stopped putting extra salt in my food at the table long ago and I try to cut down on the salt I use in cooking. The recommended daily level of salt for adults is 6 grams. It is easy to see that if you avoid processed  foods and use salt in your cooking within the limit, you won't exceed the daily level.\nThe research showed how much salt there is in some foods that we buy from restaurants and takeaways. An average salad with rice and peas has 6.2 grams of salt. This is more salt than you are supposed to eat for the whole day.\nA researcher talked about the importance of home cooking rather than take-outs. At home, he pointed out, not only can you hold control of the salt shaker, but also you can create tasty food which is low on salt. The researcher later provided curry goat and rice and peas.

After explaining   where my new house was, I told him that I had left the key under the doormat  .

At the moment, he said, he was listening to some of my records after having had a delicious meal. Now, he said, he was drinking a glass of orange juice. When I asked him if he had had any difficulty finding the house, he answered that the only problem was that he had not been able to find the key under the doormat, but luckily, the living room window by the apple tree had been left open and he had climbed in through the window.

      "Beginning college is exciting: new ideas to explore, new challenges to be met and many decisions to be made; your future begins here.\nHowever, you will find college life is different from your previous school environment. Many of us can be easily overwhelmed by the details of running a well-balanced life. While some of us may have the know-how, I guess there are more of us who can benefit from learning about the experiences of others who have walked the college halls before you.\nThe following you may find of use about life on campus:\n*Plan well. There are so many new things to do at a new college or university. Give yourself time to make new friends and became familiar with the campus, but don't forget why you are there. Give some time for social activities and manage your time wisely.\n*If you don't have a \"system\" for planning your time now (like a day timer a computer data book). get one. Most of all, don't depend on your memory.\n*Don't miss the guidelines. The restrictions, rules and regulations of all kinds can usually be found in your student's handbook. Consider them well-balanced food for thought. What dates are important? What pieces of paper need to be handed in? What can / can't you do in your student residence ? Who has the right for what? What do you need to complete to graduate?\n*Write the word \"STUDY\" on the walls of our bedroom and bathroom, and maybe it will help to to write it on a piece of paper and stick it on the telephone, TV and the kitchen table. Consider this -- you are paying thousands of dollars for your course. You pay every time you have to repeat or replace a course.\n*Build your identity. This is the time for you to decide what to do and what not to do. Take as much time as you need to explore new ideas. Do not be afraid of the beyond. This is learning to make good choices."

      "Do you feel embarrassed when your mum tries to use slang  or when she calls you by your childhood nickname in front of your friends? And how about searching for the nearest exit when your father dances with joy when he finds his favorite CD in the shop? Loving them dearly doesn't prevent you from feeling uncomfortable around them. \nAnd parents have to accept that Adam Gopnick, a writer for the New Yorker magazine, said in an article published by the BBC: ''The one thing that is written into the human genome   is that exactly at the age of 13, your child... will discover that you are now the most embarrassing, ridiculous and annoying person on the planet.'' \nA survey by the site YoungPoll.com in 2010 suggested that one in three youngsters is so  _ by their parents that they refuse to be seen with them in public; and seven in ten children are humiliated   by their mum and dad's behavior, like kissing them in front of friends and holding their hands. \nPart of going through adolescence is a sudden feeling that we are wise and self-sufficient and we are embarrassed when treated like vulnerable babies. But we are bound to lose this discomfort when we reach our 20s. \nGopnick reminds us of writer William Blake's comment: ''When I was 14, my dad seemed to be so silly that I wouldn't even walk down the street with him. By the time I was 21, I was amazed how much he'd learnt.'' \nIn any case, dissatisfied parents might feel comforted in the thought that their grandchildren are likely to end up enjoying their company. Then the uncool   ones will be the grandchildren's parents!"

The ground was covered with snow. I could remember watching black cracks in the earth snaking their way along the ground. A tree in our back yard was actually cut in half.\nAs suddenly as the earthquake started, it was over. Dead silence. Then a light snow began to fall. All the power was off--no radio, no TV and no communication with the outside world.

      "Wang Lu, 24, one of many students studying abroad who'll come home for work, majors in business & management studies at Edinburgh's Napier University. She had planned what to do after graduation in the UK: two years' work experience at a restaurant and a tour around Europe. But now her plans are up in the air.\n         Following the UK Home Secretary's meeting on reform of the student immigration system, the UK government recently announced the end of the post-study work visa from April 2012. This will force tens of thousands of Chinese students to leave the UK after graduation.\n         Sadly, the domestic job market doesn't welcome them with open arms. A report by Tigtag.com at the end of 2011 showed that over 35 percent of students admitted that they have employment problems.\n         \"Returning students often have fluent English, creative minds and a serious attitude toward work,\" said Zhang Tingwen, an HR expert in ChinaHR.com. \"But lack of work experience is a big problem.\" Xia Lei, an HR manager, responded to Zhang. \"We need people who can work for us. We don't need people from big name universities to attract customers\".\n         Difference in work practices is another problem that worries employers, Zhang pointed out. \"Some returning students might be used to Western ways of dealing with people and things.\"\n         Huang Shanshan, 25, got a job in a communication company in Shenzhen.   \"I once worked part-time in UK. My colleagues ate snacks when they felt hungry, even during working time or in meetings.\" Huang brought some cakes to the office and ate them.

      "From their beginnings New England towns had a special democratic system of government. At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting, where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely. They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television. Occasionally a meeting of this type is called by a government agency in order to give an opportunity for free and open discussion on current problems and policies."

      "In the 19thcentury, Americans from the eastern states moved out west to settle in the rich new lands along the Pacific Coast. The most difficult part of their trip was crossing \"the Great American Desert\" in the western part of the United States by horse and wagon.\nThe western desert can be very dangerous. There is little water and there are few trees. But the desert also has scenery of great beauty. Tall towers of red and yellow stone rise sharply from the flat, sandy valley floor. The scene has been photographed many times and appears in movies and on TV.\nIn Arizona, man-made dams across the Colorado River have made two large lakes in the middle of the dry desert country. At Lake Powell, the red stone arch of Rainbow Bridge rises high above the blue lake.\nThere are few roads. Many areas of Lake Powell's shore can only be reached by boat or on foot. But hikers in this empty desert land sometimes find very old native American pictures, painted on the rocks.\nIn Death Valley, California, the summer temperature rises to 130degF--165degF. There is less than inches of rain each year. Death Valley is the lowest place in America---925 metres below sea level. In the 1800s, many travelers died when they tried to cross this waterless valley in the terrible heat.\nAlthough the desert is dry and seems empty, there is plenty of life if you look closely. Snakes and rats have learned how to live in the desert heat. They live underground and come out at night, when it is cool. Plants such as cacti need very little water. When it does rain in the desert (sometimes only once or twice a year), plants grow quickly, and flowers open in a single day. For a short time, the desert is covered with brilliant (very bright) colours."

Under her body lay her baby,who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months' old. Since well protected by his mother's body,he was safe. He was in a deep sleep when the rescuer carried him out,and his lovely and peaceful face warmed everyone around him. The doctor,along with the rescuing team,took the baby out of the quilt to check if the baby was all right,and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt. The doctor looked at the screen;a written message was already there:\"My dear baby,if you could live,don't forget how much I love you.\" As a doctor,he experienced much of this type of separation;but at this moment,he cried.

      "Norway tops the list of countries that offers the best social policies for people over 60. Afghanistan is rated the worst. The rankings appear in the new Global Age Watch Index. Help Age International published the index of 96 countries that are home to 790-million people 60 and older. Chief Executive Officer Toby Porter said, \"For too long, older people have been excluded  from international and national development planning. We have a world which is ageing fast. And what the index does is to compare and rank countries from best to worst countries in the world to grow old,\" he said. The Global Age Watch Index rates countries in four categories. \"Health, income, what we call capability - ability to carry on contributing employment. And then the final one about enabling environment - what do older people think about the environment that they live in.\"  \n\"The focus on the report this year is on pensions - on retirement income that older men and women can expect.\" The index reports only one in four older people over 65 in low and middle income countries have any kind of retirement saving. Norway gets the highest ranking in the index. Rounding out the top 10 are Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Iceland, the United States, Japan and New Zealand. Afghanistan is at the bottom of the list following many years of conflict. There are 10 African countries on the index - all near the bottom. South Africa ranks the highest among them at 80. However, Porter said South Africa is doing some positive things. \"We've seen some very encouraging public statements from some senior politicians in South Africa that they recognize the contribution and the importance of supporting their older population. South Africa is one of the so-called BRICS nations - countries with strong emerging economies. Other members include Brazil, ranked 58 - Russia, ranked 65 - India, 69 and China, 48. Porter said, \"A lot of the impetus  behind China introducing pension provision for all of her older citizens was to provide an motivation for them to start using their purchasing power earlier in their lives in spending money rather than saving it for a pension.\" Help Age International recommended African nations begin providing pensions when people turn 60. However, if countries are poor, they might not be able to institute a pension system to every eligible  person at once. Another factor is Africa's youth population, which is much greater than most parts of the world. Therefore, governments are already hard pressed to provide education and jobs."

      "Several years ago I worked in an office, which had a locust tree growing outside the window. It had grown into a tall tree and must have been there for a long time. The tree blocked the view and made the office seem dull, unfortunately this happened to be the room assigned to me and I was depressed by it for quite some time.\n When the first spring came, everything was green except the locust tree. Secretly, I was very happy because I had thought it had died.\n One morning when I opened the window for fresh air, I unexpectedly smelt a familiar sweet scent floating into my office but I couldn't name it. Suddenly, I realized it was the locust tree! The tree that I thought dead was blossoming in full glory.\n From then on, I usually came to the office very early to see dew forming on the locust tree blossoms and every year was eager to see spring again.\n During summer, the green leaves provided shade protecting me from the harsh sunlight, but allowing enough light in to make it pleasant. In autumn, the leaves turned into many different color1s. Its beauty touched my soul. Many times I thought to take photos but never did. Then I had to leave in a hurry. Later in life it became a great regret that I had not done so.\n Actually, many times in our lives, we think we own something, therefore we don't cherish it. We don't feel regretful until we lose it one day! Moreover, sometimes, we have to accept the things we don't want and need to discover the hidden beauty to find unexpected joy!"

      "Sports, drama, and a variety of organizations keep students busy during high school. Where do they find the money to do these things? Not everyone gets it from Mommy and Daddy. Most have to pay for these activities. Some adults question if high school students should have jobs. \nSome people worry that teens with after-school jobs will struggle to find time for homework. Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress. Better to learn how to deal with busy schedules in a controlled environment like high school than to be out on your own and alone, experiencing stress for the first time. I personally would be more concerned for the teenager who has to become independent without having any familiarity with working.\nThe biggest reason teens should be allowed to work is that it is a healthy way of earning money. My dad told me, \"Having a job is a good way to save up for things you are going to need or want to do. You get a lot more out of things if you are financially responsible for them.\" Kids need the freedom to choose how to spend their money. The sooner they have an income, the sooner they can learn how to use money wisely. If they are not allowed to work in high school, they may run into trouble in the future."

His worried wife Nicola only found out he was being held after she reported him missing when he did not turn up for their daughter's ninth birthday party. The 54-year-old man had his fingerprints, DNA and _ taken before being questioned about why he did not appear to be enjoying the event on July 28. Police said Mr. Worsfold, who was held for over five hours, was arrested because of his manner, his state of dress and his being too near to the course. A spokesman added that the arrest was necessary to avoid a breach   of the peace because he was standing near a group of protesters  .\nBut Mr. Worsfold, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2010, said that one of the symptoms of the disease is muscle rigidity, which can cause his face to become expressionless. \"I was sitting minding my own business\", he told a local newspaper. \"Before I knew anything the police grabbed me off this seven-foot wall, threw me to the floor and handcuffed me, so all I saw of the cycle race was between the feet of people from the pavement. It could have been done better. I was arrested for not smiling. I have Parkinson's disease. \"\nMr. Worsfold has since asked for a letter of not being guilty from police.

      "Nothing is more frustrating than not being able to sleep, tossing and turning  . Your mind is racing, going over everything that happened that day. Night noises keep you awake. What can you do? Here are some things you can do to help you to fall asleep.\nSleep only when sleepy\nThis reduces the time you are awake in bed.\nIf you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up and do something boring until you feel sleepy.\nDon't expose yourself to bright light while you are up. The light tells your brain that it is time to wake up.\nDon't take naps\nThis will ensure that you are tired at bedtime. If you just can't make it through the day without a nap, sleep less than one hour, and take a nap before 3 p.m.\nGet up and go to bed at the same time every day\nEven on weekends! When your sleep cycle has a regular rhythm, you will feel better.\nRegular exercise can help you sleep well, but the time to do exercise is important. Exercising in the morning or early afternoon will not interfere   with sleep.\nHave a snack before bedtime\nIf your stomach is too empty, that can interfere with sleep. However, if you eat a heavy meal before bedtime, that can interfere as well. Have a warm glass of milk.\nTake a hot bath 90 minutes before bedtime\nA hot bath will raise your body temperature, but it is the drop in body temperature that may make you feel sleepy."

      "Paul received an automobile from his brother as a Christmas present. On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office, a street boy was walking around the shiny new car, admiring it. \"Is this your car, Mister?\" he asked. \nPaul nodded. \"My brother gave it to me for Christmas.\" The boy was astonished. \"You mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you anything? Boy, I wish....\" He hesitated. Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for. He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the kid said made Paul quite surprised.\n\"I wish,\" the boy went on, \"that I could be a brother like that.\" Paul looked at the boy in astonishment, and then impulsively he added, \"Would you like to take a ride in my automobile?\"\n\"Oh, yes, I'd love that.\"\nAfter a short ride, the boy turned and with his eyes shining, said, \"Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?\" Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the he wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But Paul was wrong again.\n\"Will you stop where those two steps are?\" the boy asked. He ran up the steps. Then after a little while Paul saw him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, then sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car. \"There  _ is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didn't cost him a cent. And some day I'm going to give you one just like it... then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying to tell you about.\"\nPaul got out and lifted the kid to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.\nThat Christmas Eve, Paul learned that it was more blessed to give...."

      "To a large degree, the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment. Regardless of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are -- always!\nWe allow past problems and future concerns to control our present moments, so much that we end up anxious, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. We often convince ourselves future will be better than today. John Lennon once said, \"Life is what's happening while we're busy making other plans. \"When we're busy making other plans\", our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away. In short, we miss out on life.\nMany people live as if life were a dress rehearsal for some later date. It isn't. In fact, no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow. Now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over. When our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds. Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future--we won't have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whatever. \nTo struggle against fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present. Mark Twain said, \"I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.\" I don't think I can say it any better. Practice keeping your attention on the here and now and your efforts will pay off."

      "Hidden in a small street in the south end of Springfield, not far from buildings torn apart by the tornado  earlier this year, Frigo's is an Italian restaurant right in our own backyard.\nFrigo's is not a tiny place. It provides different kinds of Italian food. There are refrigerator cases full of prepared foods and desserts, and shelves filled with olives and various pasta.\nThere's some traditional Italian music and the smell is of olive oil and garlic . Above the largest refrigerator case, there's a chalk board covered with desriptions of more Italian sandwiches than I could remember.\nI stepped into Frigo's almost by accident when I had to stay in Springfield into the evening for an open house at the school where I work. Frigo's is the perfect place to find something quick to go. There are no tables, so all food is taken out. I also thought it would be a great place to pick up some already-prepared food to bring home for dinner.\nI ordered the easiest meal possible: a chicken sandwich and a salad. It cost$4.75 for the sandwich. The salad was$4.99 and didn't have salad dressing on it. I must have missed the choice of salad dressing on the way out. The sandwich was great--great chicken, excellent tomato sauce and not too much cheese.\nI wish I had tried one of the many other sandwiches which include Joe's Favorite ($5.25-$6.75) and the Dante (King) which is made of turkey breast, roasted red peppers, asiago cheese and choice of dressing.\nI have a feeling that I'll be picking up dinner for me and the kids at Frigo's soon."

      "We produce 500 billion of plastic bags in a year worldwide and they are thrown away polluting oceans,  killing wildlife and getting dumped in landfills where they take up to 1000 years to decompose. Researchers have been unsuccessfully looking for a solution.\nThe 16-year old Canadian high school student, Daniel Burd, from Waterloo Collegiate Institute,\nhas discovered a way to make plastic bags degrade  in as few as 3 months, a finding that won him first prize at the Canada-Wide Science Fair, a $10 000 prize, a $20 000 scholarship, and a chance to revolutionize a major environmental issue.\nBurd's strategy was simple: Since plastic does eventually degrade, it must be eaten by microorganisms  . If those microorganisms could be identified, we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.\nWith this goal in mind, he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted  a solution of household chemicals, yeast  and tap water to encourage microbes growth. Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for 3 months. Finally, he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags, exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control. Sure enough, the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17% lighter than the control after six weeks.\nThe inputs are cheap: maintaining the required temperature takes little energy because microbes produce heat as they work, and the only outputs are water and tiny levels of carbon dioxide.\n\"Almost every week I have to do chores and when I open the closet door, I have piles of plastic bags falling on top of me. One day, I got tired of it and I wanted to know what other people are doing with these plastic bags. The answer: not much. So I decided to do something myself.\" said Daniel Burd."

      "One of the best-known American writers of children's books is Alfred Strong, or Doctor Strong, as he is better known to readers everywhere. Now, an art show called \"Doctor Strong From Then to Now\" is travelling around the United States. The pictures and drawings show the history of Doctor Strong.\nDoctor Strong first became famous almost fifty years ago when his first children's book was published. Since then, he has written forty-five books that have sold more than one hundred million copies around the world.\nDoctor Strong's books are known for their easy use of words and colorful, hand-drawn pictures. These drawings bring life to his imaginary creatures. The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, and hundreds of others.\nThe San Diego Museum, in California, organized the art show. It included about three hundred Doctor Strong's original  drawings and some of his writings.\nMost of Doctor Strong's books, although written in a funny way, have serious messages. For example, in Mc Elligot's Pool, he describes the danger of pollution. He discusses the arms race in The Butter Battle Book, written in nineteen eighty-four.\nDoctor Strong is almost eighty-four years old now. He says he never planned to write stories just for children. He says he writes stories that interest people of all ages. He says he uses easy words so that everyone, even a child, can understand."

      "In America, drivers' education is part of the regular high school curriculum  . Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead it is a summer course.\nThe course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations, and driving time to practice driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students study the basic traffic laws from a text to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone who wants to get a driver's license.\nDriving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel and practice starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers    required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \"driver\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back.\nAfter the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old),they can go to a designated   state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The person must pass all three tests in order to be given a driver's license. If the person did well in his or her driver's education class, he or she will pass the test\nand get a driver's license."

      "Healthy relationships are fun and make you feel good about yourself. The relationships that you make in your teenage years will be a special pan of your life. They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n    How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n    You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n    Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n    You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.  In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her."

They will attend US schools, meet US teenagers, and form impressions of the real America. At the same time, about thirteen hundred American teenagers will go to other countries to learn new languages and gain a new understanding of the rest of the world. \nHere is a two-way students exchange in action. Fred, nineteen, spent last year in Germany with George's family. In turn, George's son Mike spent a year in Fred's home in America.\nFred knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected --- much harder. Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no extracurricular  activities.\nFamily life, too, was different. The father's word was law, and all activities were around the family rather than the individual . Fred found the food too simple at first. Also, he missed having a car.\n'Back home, you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time. In Germany, you walk, but you soon learn to like it.'\nAt the same time, in America, Mike, a friendly German boy, was also forming his idea. 'I suppose I should criticize American schools,' he said. 'It is too easy by our level. But I have to say that I like it very much. In Germany we do nothing but study. Here we take part in many activities.

      "Ladji Doucoure of France beat Olympic champion Liu Xiang of China in the final meters to claim the title of the men's 110 meters hurdles at the 10thworld championships in Helsinki on Friday.\nDoucoure, who led the world this season with 12.97 seconds, over took the Chinese to win the race in 13.07 seconds. Liu was second in 13.08. Four-time world champion Allen Johnson of the United States took the third in 13.10.\nThe 22-year-old Doucoure said after the race, \" I can not tell you just how long I have been dreaming of this. This victory is the result of a lot of hard work, and also a lot of support from people who have believed in me. I had a bad start, touched a few hurdles, but after the 4thhurdle I _ and went straight to the finish line.\"\nLiu, who won the Olympic gold with a world record-tying time of 12.91 seconds, said, \"I'm very satisfied with the second place. The result could have been worse. I felt quite well and did my best. I' m not tired, I had some clearance problems at the start, so I should practice that some mor. Finally, I didn't lose by much, only by a little bit, but I did think I could win it.\"\nLiu's coach, Sun Haiping said on Friday he was content with Liu's performance.\n\" Liu Xiang was quite good during his reaction period, but he was a little bit slow in the middle and he finally caught up during the last two hurdles,\" Sun told Xinhua.\nAlthough satisfied with the silver medal and the clocking of 13.08 seconds, Sun said Liu might have added the world title to the Olympic championship if Liu had run the track neighboring his major rivals  of Doucoure Ladji or Allen Johnson.\n\" If he had run next to Ladji Doucoure or Allen Johnson, Liu could have kept pace with them and then sprinted  at the last stage. In this case, he could grab the gold,\" said Sun, who had become a household name for coaching China's first men's Olympic champion in the track."

      "The college entrance exam is not only a big challenge   for Chinese high school students, but also a very important exam in the lives of South Korean students.\nAlthough the long, cold winter has already started in South Korea, the annual   national exams have made the atmosphere very heated.\nMore than 675,000 South Korean high school graduates took the college entrance exam last Wednesday. They usually take exams in Korean, maths, sociology  , history and foreign languages.\nOfficially there is one college place for every 1.33 students. But because all the students want to go to the top universities in the country, the competition can reach one place for 10 students. The students want to attend these colleges for both their famous names and better job opportunities.\nBecause students face fierce competition, they have to study very hard to realize their dreams. Park Seung said he and his classmates often go to school before 7:30 a.m. After school has finished at 6:30 p.m., most of them go to the library to continue their study instead of returning home. Since many libraries in South Korea are open 24 hours a day, they often stay long into the night. Many of the Senior 3 students only sleep for three to four hours a day. \"I feel a lot of pressure, but I have to study very hard in order to make my dream come true. This is my lifetime goal and it will be a turning point in my life which could decide my future,\" Park said.\nThe exam day is a very serious day for the whole of South Korea. Vehicles are not allowed within a 200-metre radius   of all the test sites to make sure the students have quiet surroundings. Tooting   of horns is forbidden, even airplanes are ordered to avoid landing and take-off near the test sites during listening comprehension test hours.\nStudents are told their scores in December before they apply for college. This is followed by face-to-face oral tests. There are public and private universities in South Korea. Many private universities are well-known, but their fees can be 18, 000 yuan each term. This has made a lot of students think again."

      "\"I would almost rather see you dead,\" Robert S. Cassatt, a leading banker of Philadelphia, shouted when his twenty-year-old eldest daughter announced that she wanted to become an artist. In the 19th century, playing at drawing or painting on dishes was all right for a young lady, but serious work in art was not. And when the young lady's family ranked  among the best of Philadelphia's social families, such an idea could not even be considered.\nThat was how Mary Cassatt, born in 1844, began her struggle as an artist. She did not tremble before her father's anger. Instead, she opposed him with courage and at last made him change his mind. Mary Cassatt gave up her social position and all thought of a husband and a family, which in those times was unthinkable for a young lady. In the end, after long years of hard work and perseverance , she became America's most important woman artist and the internationally recognized leading woman painter of the time."

This ambition led her to Ireland where she became a nun  at the age of eighteen.\nAfter only one year of training, she was sent to India to teach in a school called Loretto House, where the students were mostly from rich Indian families. After 15 years there, she left her duties as a teacher to \"follow Christ into the slums .\" Her heart led her away from the rich to the needs of the poor. She was then 36 years old.\nTeresa no longer was affiliated  with the Irish nuns who sent her to Loreto House but worked independently. However, her work was recognised by the Pope in Rome for she still was a nun. He allowed her to set up her own group, which was called the Missionaries of Charity .\nShe no longer dressed as a nun in the European or Irish tradition. Instead, she put on a sari, the local dress of the Indian people. At first, people were sceptical  about her motives. Soon, they realised she was really interested in loving poor people, even those who were dying and had no chance of survival.\nSoon, other Indian people began to spare time to help Mother Teresa. She had taught everyone that the poor and dying people need love most of all.\nIn 1979, she won the Nobel Peace Prize."

      "NEW ORLEANS --A two-story, 1,500-ton and 16,000-square foot school built in 1879 is being moved about 300 yards to make way for the new University Medical Center in MidCity.\nThe school' s relocation is marked as the largest structure ever to be moved in Louisiana and one of the top-ten heaviest in America.Officials originally had planned to  _ the McDonogh No.11 School, but agreed to move the historic building at the city's request.\nThe school is being moved on a platform of steel beams put under the schoolhouse floor, then set on 38 remote-controlled power dollies made mobile by 300 tires.The school is creeping forward on a short stay that will take about two days to move it about 300 yards.\nState officials said the operation shows how closely the state and city leaders are working topreserve history.\n\" We' re looking to the future and building for the future, and building something new.We're also honoring the past and trying to save something historic,\" said Michael Diresto with the Division of Administration for the state of Louisiana.\nChristian Cancienne, president and CEO of Orleans Shoring, said the feat of this endeavor is something a person rarely sees.\n\"When we heard about the opportunity to move a building this size, we knew that there was never a building moved this size in the state of Louisiana,\" he said.\"We knew that because of the oak trees and neutral ground and the narrow streets, we may never get the opportunity in our hometown again to do something like this.\nCancienne said the cost of the huge project weighs in at $350,000, but he' s not making any profit from the move.Cancienne said his team wanted to do the project for free because of the once in a lifetime opportunity.\"When my guys heard that this opportunity was here, they said, 'Let' s do it for free.We got to get it.No one else can do it.' And, so, we said let's just cover our cost so we bid it at $ 350,000.\"\nCancienne' s company is used to moving homes across the city, but is happy to partake in the monumental task of moving a historic landmark.The building won' t remain at its current destination on Banks Street, though.It will eventually move to its permanent location once that has been determined."

      "More than 4 in 10 cancers -- 600,000 in the UK alone -- could be prevented if people led healthier lives, say experts. The population of the UK is about 63,000,000.\nLatest figures from Cancer Research UK show smoking is the biggest avoidable risk factor  , followed by unhealthy diets. The charity advises people to live healthily, limit alcohol intake and do regular exercise.\nAccording to the figures from 2007 to 2011, more than 300,000 cases of cancer recorded were linked to smoking. A further 145,000 were linked to unhealthy diets containing too much processed food. Obesity contributed to 88,000 cases and alcohol to 62,200. Sun damage to the skin and physical inactivity were also contributing factors.\nProfessor Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician, says, \"There's now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big influence on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors.\"\n\"Of course everyone wants to enjoy some extra treats during the Christmas holidays so we don't want to ban beef pies and wine but it's a good time to think about taking up some healthy habits.\"\n\"Leading a healthy lifestyle can't guarantee someone won't get cancer but _ by taking positive steps.\"\nPublic Health England says a healthy lifestyle can play an important role in reducing cancer risk. It says campaigns such as Smokefree, Dry January and Change4Life Sugar Swaps all aim to raise public awareness. It's important that we not only continue to make progress in noticing cancer earlier and improving treatments, but helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains important in dealing with cancer."

      "It was a warm April day when a big fat envelope came in the mail from the only college I had ever imagined attending. I tore open the packet. My eyes were fixed on the word \"congratulations. \"I don't remember ever smiling so wide.\nThen I looked at my financial package.\nThe cost of Dream School's tuition , room and board was around $ 40,000- an impossible sum! How could I afford to attend? What good reasons did I have to go there when three other fine colleges were offering me free tuition? My other choices were good, solid schools even if they weren't as famous as my first choice.\nIn my mind, attending my dream university would be the only way to realize my dream of becoming a world-class writer. My parents understood how I felt. They told me that even though it would be a financial problem, I could go wherever I would be happiest. But as I was always careful with money, I wasn't sure what to do.\nOne of the schools that _ had an informational dinner one night in the spring. Considering my parents' financial difficulties, I decided to drive the 45 minutes and attend. At first, all I had planned to do was smile politely, eat free food, listen quietly. But I surprised myself.\nAt dinner the president of the university talked about the wonderful activities on campus  including guest lectures and social gatherings. He also made it perfectly clear that free food would be offered at all future events. He continued with explanations of professors, class sizes, activities, and sporting events on campus. As he spoke, I began to realize that this school, though not as good as my first choice, might be the best one for me. It seemed small yet with many great programs. It seemed challenging yet caring.\nAs the president ended his speech, we clapped politely and pushed back our chairs. As I walked out that door, a feeling of comfort washed over me. Looking at the campus that night, I realized that I would be spending the next four years right there.\nIn all honesty, my university is not as well-known as my \"dream\"university.

      "prefix = st1 /PITTSBURGH, Sept. 7 -- At 26, many people haven't even decided on a career. Luke Ravenstahl, cashing in on his family's political tradition, is already the mayor of Pittsburgh, the youngest mayor of any major city in the country. Although mayors elsewhere have been younger, Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, small towns inNew York, and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors. But,Tallahassee, is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl. A supporter of Mr. Ravenstahl said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would _ once the city saw his work ethic.\nBut now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters.\nAnd another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said.\nBut one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him. Deli, Jimmy Cvetic, a sandwich shop owner, said \"I call him Cool Hand Luke. He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.\"\nMayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced."

      "Bruce Jun Fan Lee was born in the hour of the Dragon, between 6 and 8 a.m., in the \"Year of the Dragon\" on November 27, 1940 at the Jackson Street Hospital in San Francisco's Chinatown. Today, a plaque   in the hospital's entry remembers the place of his birth. Bruce's birth, in the hour and the year of Dragon, is a powerful symbol in Chinese astrology  . It would be a strong indication of the powerful life that was to be lived by Bruce Lee and the explosive influence his life would have on countless others.\nAt the age of three months, Lee Hoi Chuen, his wife Grace and baby Bruce returned to Hong Kong where Bruce would be raised until the age of 18. Probably because of the long ocean voyage and the change in climates, Bruce was not a strong child in his very early years, a condition that would change when he took up the study of kung fu at the age of 13.\nAt the age of 13, Bruce was introduced to Master Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. For five years Bruce studied diligently and became very proficient. Regarding Yip Man as a master teacher and wise man, Bruce respected him greatly and frequently visited with him in later years. When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \"enemies\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat   build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one's honor through fighting.\nIn high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship.\nAt the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically. His family decided that it was time for him to return to the land of his birth and find his future there. In April of 1959, with $100 in his pocket, Bruce boarded a steamship and began his voyage to San Francisco."

      "China, known as the \"kingdom of bicycle\", will see a quick growth in electric bicycle production in the next five years thanks to the country's efforts to save energy and improve the environment.\nThe output of electric bikes is expected to maintain an annual growth rate of at least 80 percent in the coming five years. China will _ 30 million electricity-driven bikes in 2020, compared to 9 million bikes last year, according to a report from the Development Research Center under the State Council and other ministries such as the National Development and Reform Commission.\nThe central government wants to reduce the amount of energy consumption   by as much as 20 percent within the next five years. That would be achieved through the introduction of new sources of energy and encouraging people to save energy, China Daily reported.\nThe smoke from car exhausts   is a major cause of pollution darkening the sky in Chinese cities, especially Beijing. On Monday, industrial experts called on the government to come up with more preferential   measures to spread the use of electric bikes in China.\nElectric bike production in China accounts for about 90 percent of the world's total, making China the world's biggest producer, consumer and exporter of the energy-efficient vehicle, the report said. The country last year sold about 3 million electric bikes to foreign countries, a figure expected to double in five years. By 2020, the production value of the electric bike industry in China is expected to be 70 billion yuan, almost four times of the current level."

      "An air of anxious uncertainty spread throughout the small Indian camp as the sun dawned that morning. Some braves gathered beside a smoking campfire. Murmuring sounds could be heard as they talked quietly. Women nervously performed their domestic tasks, preparing a small meal. Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low.\nThe camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom. The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces. They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat. Their homes were destroyed. Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy. The chase  had lasted for days. Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn. Their  _ journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation. Before them was a great hole in the earth. Behind them was the enemy. No wonder they were frozen with fear. Where could they go?\nJust when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp. With great excitement they reported seeing a stone bridge across the valley, just a short distance from camp. Most of the tribe discounted this wild story. However, a few hurried to the spot to see for themselves. Seeing was believing! Indeed there was a stone bridge, great enough to accommodate many people and their horses. Without hesitation the people gathered up their children and the belongings they had and hurried across the bridge.\nEnemy braves watched from a nearby cliff. It was obvious that the Great Spirit was on the side of the defeated. The enemy did not follow. Safe on the other side of the valley, the wanderers thanked the Great Spirit for providing the vital link. They had escaped their enemies. \nFor hundreds of miles around, Indian people heard about the miraculous stone bridge. From this incident it was clear that the Great Spirit defends weak people. Many came from near and far to see the magnificent stone bridge. You, too, can see this bridge and even ride across it in a car--in southwestern Virginia."

      "On a hot summer day, a soft drink can really take away your thirst. At home, at school, in the park or at the movies---you can find one almost anywhere.\nCarbonated\nYou can see bubbles  in these! Of all soft drinks sold, about 75 percent are carbonated . But be careful, carbonated soft drinks have lots of sugar and caffeine . Caffeine is not very good for you in the summer because it takes water out of your body. And the sugar can make you overweight if you drink too much.\nFruit juice\nThere are different kinds of juice. One kind is made only from fresh fruit. This kind of fruit juice may not taste sweet enough for some people, but it is nutritious . Another kind of fruit juice tastes good but has lots of sugar in it. Many young people buy this kind because the advertisements are good. It is bad for your teeth and bones to drink lots of this.\nEnergy drinks\nThese kinds of drinks have caffeine and things that make people get excited in them. They are sometimes called \"party drinks\". Doctors say that if you drink too much of this kind, you may have a heart attack.\nBottled water\nWe have lots of different kinds of bottled water, such as mineral water, purified water and distilled water . They are clean and easy to drink. But it is best not to drink very cold water. It may make your stomach feel bad.\nSports drinks\nMost of these have funny names like \"Scream \" and \"G-Vital \". They have lots of vitamins and minerals in them. After you play sports, you may want to drink one of these.\nBut if you just spend your summer holiday sitting around watching TV, you won't need them at all!"

      "A group of graduates, well established in their careers, were talking at a reunion and decided to visit their old university professor, now retired. During their visit, the conversation turned to complaints about stress in their work and lives.\nOffering his guests hot chocolate, the professor went into the kitchen and returned with a large pot of hot chocolate and other things including cups-porcelain , glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some elegant -- telling them to help themselves to the hot chocolate.\nWhen they all had a cup of hot chocolate in hand, the professor said: \"I notice that all the nice looking and expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. The cup that you're drinking from adds nothing to the quality of the hot chocolate. In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was hot chocolate, not the cup; but you consciously went for the best cups... And then you began eyeing each others cups. Now consider this: Life is the hot chocolate; your job, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life. The cup you have does not define, nor change the quality of life you have. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the hot chocolate we have. The happiest people don't have the best of everything. They just make the best of everything that they have. Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak kindly. Thank the Lord for your blessings in 2011. And enjoy your hot chocolate in 2012!\""

      "London Heathrow is the biggest airport in the UK, and it also handles more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world. For this reason, enlargement was planned and on 27th March a fifth terminal opened to help to deal with the many passengers that pass through the airport. The new terminal has taken a long time to plan and build. The idea was first proposed back in the 1980s. The opening of it has been talked about widely in the media in the UK and expectations were high for the PS4.3 billion project.\n   However, in spite of long preparations at Terminal 5 ahead of the grand opening, things soon went into a mess. There were problems from the very beginning as staff had difficulties finding car parking spaces and getting through security to get into the building. This consequently caused a delay when passengers started to arrive and large numbers of staff were not in place. Long passenger queues formed and the slow start meant that everyone had to play catch-up from the beginning. Staffs were having problems using the new systems and a baggage operator told the BBC, it was all \"shambles   the moment the doors opened\". The terminal has been designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour but due to a reported \"lack of training and essential support that was promised\", a backlog   of luggage soon appeared.\n   By lunchtime on that first day, 20 flights had been cancelled to try to alleviate the problems. Flights continued to be cancelled in the days following the opening and up to 28,000 bags have now had to be placed in temporary storage. The British Airline, the only airline operating at Terminal 5 says it is working to clear the backlog, but the negative publicity caused by the shambles has not helped the airport or the airline's reputation at all."

      "After months of fear, hate and prosecution , the music and consumer-electronics industry decided to try to make beautiful music together. Last week the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a combination of 100 music, electronics and high-tech companies announced that it agreed on a music format  known as MP3 which caused disagreement. Nowadays, more and more young people are fond of music that is played on their portable MP3 players. So this announcement attracted a lot of attention in both the producer and consumer sides.\n       MP3 allows the digital music in CDs to be made smaller to a tenth its size and still sounds great. MP3 songs are small enough to be traded online; they are made by the millions to the _ of record companies, which fear that everything ever released on disc will end up online for free. Traditional records and their sale may be greatly damaged by this new format of music, and for the music's sake, it is better conveyed in this new medium.\n       That's why the recording industry appealed to the court against little Diamond Multimedia when it started selling a portable MP3 player two years ago. Not only did Diamond win in court, but it also sold 100,000 Rios along the way. With half a dozen other companies racing to produce their own versions of the Rio for Christmas, what could the music industry do? They have no choice in their future, their success just depends on how they can deal with the new trend and cooperate with the electronics companies.\n       It couldn't ignore MP3, which has become the format of choice among new bands trying to advertise their pre-released songs. So the industry agreed on it on one condition: within 18 months, when a standard is adopted that allows piracy-protected music (free from being illegally copied) to be sold online, the electronics companies agree to make their players in line with it. This clears the way for the new magic MP3 players, which is both convenient and capable of carrying on much more music than traditional walkmans. What's next? Digitally pirated movies. Get ready,prefix = st1 /Hollywood."

      "What does the future hold for the problem of housing? A good deal depends, of course, on the meaning of \"future\". If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on. Not every area may give the same resources as Hong Kong to draw upon and the search for quicker and cheaper methods of construction must never stop."

      "Every few years, two groups carry out a study of how many Americans wash their hands after using the toilet. These groups are the American Society for Microbiology and the American Cleaning Institute, formerly the Soap and Detergent Association.\nThere was good news in the latest study. Researchers found that eighty-five percent of adults washed their hands in public restrooms last month. That was the most since the studies began in 1996.\nResearchers visited restrooms at a baseball park in Atlanta and a science museum and aquarium  in Chicago. They also visited two train stations in New York City and a large farmers' market in San Francisco. In all, they observed about six thousand adults, with females and males equal in number.\nThe researchers found that seventy-seven percent of men and ninety-three percent of women washed their hands. That was up from sixty-six percent of men and eighty-eight percent of women in the last study three years ago.\nThe lowest rate of hand washing among men was at Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Only sixty-five percent of men washed their hands, compared to all but two percent of women.\nChicago and San Francisco had the most hand washers--eighty-nine percent of adults. Atlanta followed at eighty-two percent. New York had the lowest rate, at seventy-nine percent of the adults observed at Grand Central Station and Penn Station.\nThe findings of the observational study conflicted  with the findings of a separate telephone survey of about one thousand people. Ninety-six percent of them said they always washed their hands after using public restrooms.\nAlmost nine out of ten also said they always washed after using the bathroom at home.\nHand washing can help prevent the spread of many different infections.\nTo clean your hands well, wet them first and rub in soap for at least twenty seconds, including between the fingers and under the nails. Then wash under running water. In a public restroom, if you dry your hands with a paper towel, you should also use the towel to shut off the water and open the door.\nHand washing is also important when preparing food and after changing a baby's diaper . You should also wash if you cough or sneeze into your hands."

      "Woody Guthrie left California for New York in 1940. There he met Alan Lomax, an expert on America's traditional music. He collected and recorded traditional American folk music, which had few fans at that time. When he heard Woody sing, Lomax knew he had found a true singer of American folk music. Lomax recorded many of Woody's songs for the Library of Congress. \n         Three years later, Woody published a book called Bound for Glory. It was about his early life and travels. From this book people came to learn how Woody had spent his unhappy youth. His mother, Nora Guthrie, died of Huntington's Disease   in 1929 when he was only seventeen years old. There was no treatment for the disease. About twenty years later, the disease also began to attack the son. Woody's health got worse and worse, and finally he entered a hospital.    \n         While Woody seemed to be forgotten, his music was not. By the late 1950s, folk music became popular in America. More Americans began listening and playing the songs of Woody Guthrie. Young folk singers came to New York to visit Woody in the hospital. Among them was Bob Dylan, one of America's greatest popular songwriters. He called Woody his hero. Dylan and others copied the way Woody sang and played the guitar. And like Woody, they wrote songs that called for social and political justice  .   \n         Woody Guthrie stayed in the hospital until he died in 1967. In the last years of his life, Woody could hardly speak. But his family and friends knew he still believed in the causes he had sung and written about all his life. They knew this because when they sang his songs, Woody's eyes would become brighter and his defiant   spirit would shine through."

      "A quarter of US adults say they read no books at all in the past year, according to an Associated Press-Ipsos survey. The typical person said that he / she read four books in the last year and, excluding those who had not read any books at all, the usual number of books read was seven.\nOf those who did read, women and pensioners   were the most eager readers, and religious works and popular fiction were the top choices. The number of books read was nine books for women and five for men. The number also showed that those with college degrees read the most, and people aged 50 and over read more than those who are younger.\nPeople from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least one book in the past year. Southerners who do read tend to read more books -- mostly religious books and romance novels -- than people from other regions.\nThose who said they never attend religious services read nearly twice as many books as those who attend frequently, but the Bible and religious works were read by two thirds of the people in the survey, more than all the other categories. Popular fiction, histories, biographies and mysteries took up about half, while one in five read romance novels. Politics, poetry and classical literature were named by fewer than 5% of readers. More women than men read every major category of books except for history and biography books. Men tend to prefer non-fiction.\nBook sales in the US have been flat in recent years and are expected to stay that way, which, experts think, results from competition from the Internet and other media, and the unsteady economy."

      "Remember that goals are dreams with a timetable. Our goals are important for us to create what enriches our life. A very common attitude among people who are successful is that their success lies in their ability to provide themselves goals that are both numerous and exciting. When you think about your future,you are helping to feed a long-term goal of what you want to create.\nTo realize your dreams,you must translate your vision into a series of actions you can take as soon as possible. You should be able to measure these results,to make sure they take you wherever you want. And this step should not be viewed lightly! Indeed,very few people set goals and concrete actions for themselves to achieve. Very few people note what they want to accomplish,and know each day whether they have indeed advanced in the direction of their dreams.\nTherefore one of the secrets that you can get results from is to write down your goals on paper first. When you give your dreams a form,they become more concrete,and you can refer to them often and easily. Whenever you read the dreams that you note down,you fill your mind with positive and motivational thoughts.\nUnfortunately,many people stop there. They just simply make wishes, hope and wait. These people do not bring positive difference in their lives,because that sort of behavior is just wishful thinking. Success is not at all a miracle. It depends on clear and realistic targets through serious thoughts:concrete actions and perseverance . Don't forget,your past does not determine your future. Only you now is your potential!"

      "The intelligence times provide us much convenience,but at the same time,some of our abilities are being weakened gradually.\n1. Memorizing phone numbers\nIt was annoying to remember numbers. Now we simply add them to our contacts list. That usually works well unless our device is lost,stolen,or damaged. No one can be expected to remember all their contact numbers. What we can do is memorize 5 of our most important contact numbers. This should include a mixture of family,friends and business. If you're really ambitious you can memorize 5 contacts for each category.\n2. Map-reading skills\nThe convenience and effectiveness of GPS guidance systems and digital maps generated by search engines is unquestionable. They've definitely made our lives easier. What we don't get from using these devices and applications is the increased ability to understand spatial orientation and navigation.\nTo renew or acquire those skills,try using physical maps to plan your next trip. After a few trips,you'll be pleasantly surprised with how useful a physical map can be.\n3. Photography\nEven amateur photography requires a basic learning about lighting,depth,and composition. This is true for digital photography. Most smart cameras automatically make these adjustments. We no longer have to learn the art of photography. On most devices,this is easily changed by turning off the automatic settings. Experiment with setting by hand the scene modes,lighting,and zoom. You just may learn that you're a \"true photographer\".\n4. Reading comprehension\nThe primary cause is E-reader. They're convenient and can store thousands of books. But there's evidence that E-reader makes it more difficult for readers to keep and recall information they just read. Don't worry! What we should do is make an effort to read printed books. This will be especially helpful when seeking information we need for academic or career purposes.\n5.Hand-written correspondence \nWriting letters and notes include hand writing skills,organizational skills,and learning about the person or persons you correspond with. This is another easily regained skill. Send a letter to an old friend,relative or acquaintance."

It's quite possible that, by the year 2030, every child in every school will do all their schoolwork on their own laptop with all their textbooks available on the Internet. No more heavy books to carry around and no more pens and paper!\nAt work, we already use email to deal with people both inside and outside our offices and video conferencing  is occurring more frequently. This means that meetings can be held between offices in different countries without the trouble caused by business travel. Business travel will not exist in the future, and so will offices as people all start to work from home.\nIt has also become a trend for people to use pocket computers such as Blackberries. With this helpful equipment, people can send and receive emails, surf the Web, and read multimedia files from absolutely anywhere even if we are on a beach holiday.\nThe Internet will have a revolutionary effect on entertainment in the future. Already we can buy and download music and movies from the Internet but it is still possible for us to buy a CD or go to the DVD stores to rent the latest movies. However, it's quite possible that in the future, CD shops and DVD rental stores will close and cinemas will no longer exist. Entertainment will become completely virtual although hopefully people will still want to get outside to play sports and entertain themselves in more healthy ways.\nWith the Internet we need only relax in the rocking chair. The Internet, however, has problems to be solved."

      "We live in a technological society where most goods are mass-produced by unskilled labor. Because of this, most people think that craft no longer exists.\nOne of the ways these people wrongly support their view is by pointing to 100-year-old homes which are still solid, and arguing that it is the craftsmanship that is responsible for their durability. \"Homes in those days were well-built,\" _ say. No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.\nHomes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.\nOne thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.\nThe problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material."

      "Do you scream on a roller coaster ride? You slowly climb up a steep slope until an almost vertical  drop, and then... Ahhhhhhhh! Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.\nAlton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually  feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of  time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\nOn modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\nSome companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\nI can't wait to enjoy this one. What about you: Do you like being upside down?"

      "The dirt road made our car jump as we traveled to the Millennium Village in Sauri, Kenya. We passed the market where women sat on the dusty ground selling bananas. Little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers' backs, or running around in bare feet and torn clothing. When we reached the village, we walked to the Bar Sauri Primary School to meet the people. Welcoming music and singing had almost everyone dancing. We joined the dancing and clapped along to the joyful, lively music. The year was 2004, the first time I had ever been to Sauri.\nThe Millennium Village project was created to help reach the Millennium Development Goals, which were set by the United Nations in 2000. The plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them of access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. The goals are supposed to be met by 2015; some other targets are set for 2025. But our first sight of Sauri showed us there was plenty of work to do.\nOn that day in 2004, we followed the village leaders into Yala Sub-District Hospital. It wasn't in good shape. The rooms were packed with patients who probably wouldn't receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. There was no running water or electricity in the hospital. It is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases who are near death when they shouldn't have to be. I just get scared and sad.\nMalaria is one disease, common in Africa, which is preventable and treatable. Mosquitoes carry malaria, and infect people by biting them. Kids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick. Mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. A mosquito net, treated with chemicals that last for five years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. Each net costs $5. There are some cheap medicines to get rid of malaria too. The solutions are simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. So sad, and so illogical. Mosquito nets could save millions of lives.\nWe walked over to see the farmers. Their crops started to die because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. Time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. Each year, the farmers worry: Will they harvest enough food to feed the whole family? Will their kids go hungry and become sick?\nMany kids in Sauri didn't attend school because their parents couldn't afford school fees. Some kids are needed to help with housework, such as fetching water and wood. In 2004, the schools had _ supplies like books paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn. They all worked hard with the few supplies they had. It was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there's no midday meal.\nGreat changes have taken place in these years. Today, Yala Sub-District Hospital has medicine, free of charge. Water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. There are no school fees, and the school now serves midday meals for the students. The attendance rate is way up. All this is encouraging supporters of the Millennium Villages project.\nThere are many solutions to the problems that keep people poor. What it will really take is for the world to work together to change poor areas forever. When my kids are my age, I want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history. It will not be an easy task. But Sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime."

      "I'm part of the Roots & Shoots program founded by Dr. Jane Goodall. The program is intended to make and promote positive changes in the world. As Dr. Goodall says, \"What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.\"\nIn Bulgaria, where I live, homeless dogs are everywhere. Many people here turn a blind eye to them. But I cannot ignore the life of a street dog whenever I see one wandering in the street, looking for something to eat. That's why I'm no longer a food waster. When I see wasted food, I always think of a hungry dog climbing to garbage bins, searching for food that people have thrown there. When eating in a restaurant, I'm not afraid to take leftover food to feed stray cats or dogs.\nA week ago, I saw a homeless dog around the garbage bins. Immediately I knelt down, spoke to her softly and ran my hands over her. I could see that she had had puppies. I couldn't imagine how she could have been able to care for them. Hours earlier, I'd bagged up a plate of leftover fish. As I unwrapped it, she wagged her tail and sniffed at it. She ate all the fish in no time.\nIt's sad, isn't it? I can't understand why many of us waste so much and think little of it. These homeless animals have taught me that food is precious. Even when I don't have leftovers with me, I'll take the time to get something from the grocery store to feed them.\nI know my power is small, so I hope that next time you see wasted food, do turn it into worthy food.

      "Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. He had little school education. In spite of this, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, but he is better known to all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname.\nMark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble for his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he often ran away from home. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned nine times.\nAfter his father's death, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a printer, a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner. During this period, he started to write short stories. Afterwards, he became a full-time writer.\nIn 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him great fortune.\nUnfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died, and then three of his children passed away.\nAt the age of 70, his hair was completely white. He bought many white suits and neckties. He wore nothing but white from head to foot until his death on April 21, 1910."

      "A meteor  that exploded over Russia's Ural mountains and sent burning to earth has set off a rush to find fragments of the space rock which hunters hope could fetch thousands of dollars a piece.\nFriday's explosion and following shockwave shattered windows, injured almost 1200 people and caused about $33 million worth of damage, said local authorities.\nIt also started a \"meteorite rush\" around the industrial city of Chelyabinsk,where groups of people have started _ the snow and ice.\n\"The price is hard to say yet...

      "What does the word \"home\" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Spanish? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it often has no exact translation. It's not surprising really, because the idea of home differs from country to country, and from person to person. A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.\nBut it's not just that homes look different in different countries, they also contain different things and reveal  different attitudes and needs. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it. In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows, cool stone floors and often no carpets.

      "I have only once been in trouble with the law.The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent   fate in court.\nIt happened in February about twelve years ago.I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October.I was still living at home at the time.\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived.I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling.As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me.It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.\nIt was about half past eleven when it happened.I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me.I thought he was going to ask me the time.Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me.At first I thought it was some kind of joke\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.\n'But what for?\" I asked\n'Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,' he said.\n'What offence?' I asked\n'Theft,' he said\n'Theft of what?'I asked\n'Milk bottles,' he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!\n'Oh,' I said.\nIt turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.\nThen I made my big mistake.At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as pan of the sixties' 'youth counterculture'.As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, 'How long have you been following me?  in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage.I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable   character.\nA few minutes later a police car arrived.\n'Get in the back,' they said.'Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.'\nThey got in on either side of me.It wasn't funny any more.\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours.I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation.When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job.'Aha,' I could see them thinking, 'unemployed'.\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday.Then they let me go.\nI wanted to conduct my own defense in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor  .We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness.But he was never called on to give evidence.My 'trial' didn't get that far.The magistrate   dismissed the case after fifteen minutes.1 was free.The poor police had never stood a chance.The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police.\nAnd so I do not have a criminal record.But what was most shocking at the time was the things my release from the charge so clearly depended on.I had the 'right' accent, respectable middle-class parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor.Given the obscure nature of the charge.I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is every chance that I would have been found guilty.While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously revolved   around the fact that I had a 'brilliant academic record'.\nMeanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was gloomily complaining to my mother that another youngster had been turned against the police. 'You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,' he said to me reproachfully  .\nWhat did he mean? Probably that I should have looked outraged  and said something like, 'Look here, do you know who you're talking to? I am a highly successful student with a brilliant academic record.How dare you arrest me!' Then they, probably, would have apologized perhaps even taken off their caps, and let me on my way."

      "Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ..."

      "I was on vacation, and in my mind, vacation does not mean setting my hotel room alarm clock for 6 am. But when you're in Aruba and hoping to reserve a beachside palapa , that's exactly what you do.\nTourists begin lining up at the crack of dawn to secure these umbrella-like wood structures that are covered with dried and woven palm leaves. They then place towels on chairs and call them theirs for the day, whether they remain there or not. I knew nothing of _ on my first day in Aruba. I saw an empty chair covered with a towel and took it. It was a big mistake.\nFor many visitors, a week bathing in the sun is the only activity they wish to pursue. It sounded good to my girlfriend, Barbara, and me after Boston's awful winter. Six more inches of snow was predicted on the day we left. The sun, the sand, and the beach seemed just about right.\nAruba's slogan is \"One Happy Island\", and it doesn't take long to understand why. Aruba is said to be on \"island time\". Translation: No one is in a rush to do anything. When in Aruba, you go with the flow, however slow and lazy that might be.\nCooling trade winds, white sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and dazzling sunsets are all good reasons to visit. But this 20-mile island offers more than lazy days walking on the beach. There is amazing night life, casinos, golf, scuba diving , fine dining, shopping, and a great national park.\nBut our first day was spent as you'd expect, swimming in the sea and enjoying cool drinks. Our drink of choice quickly became the Coco Loco. It's as refreshing as it sounds."

      "Health insurance   can be very expensive. Some working people do not make enough money to pay for it. In the US there is a program called Healthy Families. This program offers people health insurance at a low cost.\nFamilies are charged about $7.00 a month for every child, and $10.00 for every adult. It costs much less than any other kind of health insurance. Having health insurance is very important. With this insurance, people can see a doctor when they are sick or hurt. \nThe program is not expensive at all, but many people are still not enrolling   in it. People say that it still costs too much money. They need all of their money to pay for things like food and rent  .\nIt would be great if everyone could have health insurance. People are working hard to come up with ways to make this happen. One idea is to make the Healthy Families Program free for some people.\nIt is important for people to see a doctor when they need to.

The results were as follow:\n                    Men         Women\nIn favor       70%         80%\nAgainst              10%         20%\nDon't know           20%         0%\nWe asked readers to write and tell us their opinions.\nHere are some of the hundreds of letters we received.\nI'm a (woman)photographer. I make plenty of money, travel a lot, and meet a lot of people. I enjoy my work, and would hate to stay at home. I would never marry a man who wanted me to give up my work.\nMs. Jojo O Leary\nHampstead \nAt present there are over 1,000,000 unemployed men in Britain. If a woman gets a job, she puts one more man out of work. Perhaps that man has a wife and twelve children to support. Let women stay at home where they belong.\nTed Stubbs\nSouthend\n I am a mother of twelve children. When I go to work, my husband looks after the children.

      "Shopping in the United States changes a lot.About ninety years ago most people shopped in small stores that were owned by one person or a family.Women went from the bakery to the butcher's to the grocer and on to the fruit and vegetable seller in order to get their food for the week.\nThen about sixty years ago, supermarkets were born.In a supermarket, people could get all the different kinds of food they needed without going to different stores.\nThe next big change in shopping in the United States was the shopping mall.A shopping mall is a group of stores under one roof.Because malls allowed people to shop without worrying about the weather, they soon became very popular.The mall became a place for people to socialize in addition to shopping.If you walk through a mall, you will see older people sitting, chatting and drinking coffee.Malls are places for teenagers to hang out.Many teens will often just \"go to the mall\" and spend time with their friends.\nThe recent change in American shopping was the superstore.Large chain stores such as Wal-Mart, Office Depot and Toys \"R\" Us have been built all across the United States.Because they are so large, they can buy goods at a great discount and sell them much cheaper than smaller stores.\nSometimes, when they are built near small towns, many of the small town stores have to close.They just cannot compete with their giant neighbors.\nAnd now, online shopping is becoming more and more popular all over the States.People are too busy to go to the physical stores, so they go shopping over the Internet.Online shopping has lots of advantages.For instance, online stores are usually available 24 hours a day.Searching or browsing online shops can be faster than browsing the physical stores.While, online shopping also has its disadvantages.People are at higher risk of being cheated on the part of the merchant than in a physical store.And privacy of personal information may be let out."

      "MONTAGNE: In the summer of 2011, the world first heard of a small island in Norway under the most terrible of circumstances. Utoya Island was a youth camp run by Norway's Labor Party. One day in July, a heavily armed, right-wing extremist stepped onto the island and began shooting at random. Sixty-nine people died, over 100 were wounded; almost all, young people. This month, artist Jonas Dahlberg was appointed to create a memorial. He described to us the experience he imagines for those who come to the island.\nDAHLBERG: You start your walk through a forest of evergreens on a wooden pathway. After a while, this pathway starts to go down into the landscape.\nMONTAGNE: Down into the landscape, and into a short tunnel. When you come out, you are unable to go any farther. You can't get to the tip of the island because it has been cut off. So all you can do is look across a narrow channel of water at what is now a wall of polished stone, carved with the names of the dead.\nDAHLBERG: It becomes almost like a gravestone. You cannot reach it. It's close enough to be able to read, but it's forever lost for your possibility to reach.\nMONTAGNE: It's being called _ . Exactly what do you mean by that?\nDAHLBERG: During my first site visit, the experience of seeing those gunshots--and you can see it was like being in an open wound. And it took me to a stage of deep sadness where it was hard to breathe. So I didn't want to illustrate loss; I wanted to make actual loss. It's just a cut through the island.\nMONTAGNE: On the day of the massacre, just hours before launching his shooting on the island, the killer set off a bomb in downtown Oslo, leaving eight people dead. As those events were unfolding, artist Jonas Dahlberg had been out with his brother, and stopped in at a seaside village.\nDAHLBERG: In the harbor, it was silent, and this is the higher end of summer. So, it's normally a very lively place. And it was total silence there; and it was a very, very strange feeling in the whole small village. And it's totally impossible to grasp what is going on. And then it just kept on. It's still almost impossible to understand it. It's also one of the reasons why it's so important with memorials for these kind of things. It's to maybe help a little bit to understand what was happening. So it's not just about remembering. It's also about trying to just understand.\nMONTAGNE: Artist Jonas Dahlberg designed the memorial for the 69 who died at a youth camp on Utoya Island. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II. That memorial will open in 2015. And to see a virtual version of what it will look like, go to our website, at npr.org. This is Renee Montagne at NPR news."

      "Almost 70 percent of Chinese middle school students have serious problems with their parents, the Beijing Morning Post quoted a survey as saying.\nThe survey showed 6.62 percent of the surveyed students are afraid of their parents while 13.13 percent of them dislike their parents and 56.28 percent were extremely disgusted with or even hate their parents. Only 4.75 percent of the young people surveyed said they like their parents.\nThe recently conducted survey among 3,000 middle school students in a Beijing district asked questions about their attitude toward their parents and family education, the paper said.\nFor many families, conflict between parents and children center on the student's school grades, their weight and their friends. The survey showed that parental influence over children is decreasing, the paper said.\nXiao Xiao, a third year junior middle school student is perhaps typical of most kids when she complains; \"I was scolded by my mother because I didn't come first in the class in a mid-term exam.\"\nXiao Xiao in fact is already one of the top students in her class, the paper said, stressing Xiao Xiao's parents hope she can study at the Beijing University or even attend Harvard in the future.\nSun Yunxiao, an expert with the China Youth and Children Research Center, said \"parents expect unrealistically high expectations from their children.\"\nThe research centre's own survey of parents showed about 55 percent of parents hope their children will study for a doctoral degree and 83.6 percent require their children to rank in the top 15 of their class.\nConflicts between parents and their children not only come from too high education expectations. Other causes of disconnection between parents and children are family violence, parents' old fashioned ideas, interference in a child's privacy including their choice of friends and time spent surfing the web, the paper said.\nMr Hu, a father of a middle school student, wasn't surprised by the survey results. He says too much concern over school marks is putting tremendous pressure on families."

      "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society."

      "A couple who held hands at breakfast every morning even after 70 years of marriage have died 15 hours apart. Helen Felumlee, died at 92 on April 12. Her husband, 91-year-old Kenneth Felumlee, died the next morning.\nThe couple's eight children say the two had been inseparable since meeting as teenagers, once sharing the bottom of a bunk   bed on a ferry rather than sleeping on night apart.\nThey remained deeply in love until the very end, even eating breakfast together while holding hands, said their daughter, Linda Cody. \"We knew when one went, the other was going to go,\" she said. According to Cody, about 12 hours after Helen died, Kenneth looked at his children and said, \"Mon's dead.\" He quickly began to fade, surrounded by 24 of his closest family members and friends when he died the next morning. \"He was ready,\" Cody said, \"He just didn't want to leave her here by herself.\"\nSon Dick said his parents died of old age, surrounded by family.\nThe pair had known each other for several years when they eloped in Newport across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, on Feb. 20, 1994. At two days shy of his 21stbirthday, Kenneth-who went by Kenny-was too young to marry in Ohio. \"He couldn't wait.' son Jim said.\nKenneth worked as a railroad car inspector and mechanic before becoming a mail carrier for the Post Office. He was active in the church as a Sunday teacher.\nHelen stayed at home, not only cooking and cleaning for her own family but also for other families in need in the area. She taught Sunday school, too, but was known more for her greeting card ministry, sending cards for birthdays, sympathy and the holidays to everyone in her community, each with a personal note inside. \"She kept Hallmark in business,\" daughter-in-law Debbie joked.\nWhen Kenneth retired in 1983 and the children began to leave the house, the Felumlees began to explore their love of travel, visiting almost all 50 states by bus. \"He didn't want to fly anywhere because you couldn't see anything as you were going,\" Jim said.\nAlthough both experienced declining health in recent years, Cody said, each tried to stay strong for the other. \"That's what kept them going,\" she said."

      "EDGEWOOD-Every morning at Dixie Heights High School, customers pour into a special experiment: the district's first coffee shop run mostly by students with special learning needs.\nWell before classes start, students and teachers order Lattes, Cappuccinos and Hot Chocolates. Then, during the first period, teachers call in orders on their room phones, and students make deliveries. By closing time at 9.20 a.m., the shop usually sells 90 drinks.\n\"Whoever made the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman says it was good,\" Christy McKinley, a second year student, announced recently, after hanging up with the teacher.\nThe shop is called the Dixie PIT, which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled, many are, and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school.\nThey learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks, which they keep in check registers.\nSpecial-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar  program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia.\nNot that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should schools be selling coffee? What about sugar content?\nKenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks, which use non-fat milk, fell within nutrition   guidelines.\nThe whole school has joined in to help.\nTeachers agreed to give up their l ounge   in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks. The basketball team helped pay for cups."

      "Every year, Americans send millions of tons of food to the landfill  . What if you could use all of those rotten vegetables to heat your home? That's happening in one unlikely laboratory: the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plan in Brooklyn\nThe plant's longtime manager, Jimmy Pynn, shows off the plant's crown jewels: eight huge, shiny, oval-shaped steel tanks known as digester eggs. Each one contains millions of gallons of black material that's roughly pea soup. Pynn calls it \"black gold\". \"The digesters like to be fed like us: three times a day,\" he says. \"They like to be kept warm, 98 degrees. And that's what we have these guys for: to make methane ,which can be used to heat homes or make electricity.\"\nRight now, what these bacteria are digesting is mostly sewage  mud. But they are being introduced to a new diet food scraps. The hope is that this plant will soon take in hundreds of tons of organic waste from houses and apartments.\n\"Cardboard packaging, rotten tomatoes, fats, oils, old diary products--those are all great food-stuff for a digester,\" says Paul Sellew. \"My micro-organisms love that. That's their five-course meal.\"\n\"Everything in New York City is like big scale when you're talking about quantities of waste,\" says Samantha MacBride. \"Right now, it's all in its infancy. When you're in an apartment building, to separate out food scraps, it requires a lot of effort and attention,\" says MacBride. \"It doesn't have to have unpleasant smell or be inconvenient. But it takes extra work. It's the first, what I will call the baby step,\" says Paul Sellew. \"Because ultimately in New York City, just the restaurants alone, you're talking well over a million tons a year,\" he says.\nThis new industry is trying to build more plants and digesters to handle all of that waste, says Sellew. The costliest part may be finding good locations in or around the nation's biggest cities.\nAs for the trillions of bacteria? They'll work for free--- as long as you feed them."

      "Why do people cross their fingers when facing difficulties-eve non-religious people? Why do we blame the black cat when we saw the low score of the test?\nThese habits have been referred to as magical thinking and can be found everywhere in daily life. For example, a person wishes something bad for an annoying colleague. Or parents pray for a safe fight when seeing their son off. \nPsychologically helpful\nIn examining these habits, scientists decided to search for a reason for humans' belief in magical powers. Psychologists have their own approach to the question. \n\"I think in part it's because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts, and thus likely to overestimate their connection to outside events. \"said Emily Pronin, a psychologist in the prefix = st1 /US.\nFor people who are uncertain of their own abilities or slow to take action, magical thinking can be a great help, explained Dr. Daniel Wegner, a professor psychology at Harvard. Feeling that their own thoughts can control things can help people fight depression. \nA trait gained through evolution\nBut evolutionists have their own ideas. \nTwo schools of evolutionary thought have come up with reasons by analyzing the development of humans. They are the \"adaptationists \"and the \"byproduct theorists \". \nThe adaptationists say that belief in magical powers makes people feel better, less worried about difficulties, more focused on the future, and more willing to care for themselves. People with a strong faith (in something) have a better chance of surviving a tough environment or competition. \nBut in byproduct theory,magical thinking is a product of our psychological features. \n\"We automatically look for an explanation of why things happen,\"explains Justin Barrett, a psychologist, The brain, therefore, has evolved to make quick judgments about causation . So we often link two events based on nothing more than coincidence. For example, \"I was just thinking about looking up my old high school girlfriend when she suddenly called me. \"\nAnother psychological feature is the theory of mind. We recognize that there could be an unseen power of mind affecting the outcome of an incident. \nByproduct theorists claim that because of these features, we are born with a tendency to believe in our magical thinking. \nBut we need to confine our magical thinking, warn psychologists. \nFor most people, beliefs are just some sort of comforting private ritual. When something important is at stake, such as a test or a performance or a relationship, people don't simply perform their private rituals. They have to prepare."

Jeannie brings things to Lee Ann and puts them in her lap.\nJeannie was trained at a place called Canine Companions for Independence, located on twelve acres of land in Santa Rosa (California).

He likes it when people come to ask him about his dog. His father says, \"People are really interested in the dog and will come over and ask to pet her and play with her, and ask about what she does, and these are people that normally might not approach us and want to talk to Noah.\"\nWhen Lee Ann Laraway comes home with Jeannie and her goods, Jeannie helps her open the door. \"You can train a dog to do a lot of things.\" said Lee Ann."

      "Skateboarding has become one of several non-traditional activities that PE teachers around America are introducing to inspire kids to exercise regularly. Some PE classes feature in-line  skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts have called those types of activities \"the new PE\".\nSuch activities are part of a larger effort to help kids develop lifelong fitness habits and to keep them from becoming overweight. Now, 9 million U.S. children and teens are overweight. Obesity   can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.\n\"Our children and youth are becoming unhealthy and obese,\" says Johnson. \"Skateboarding is a great activity that keeps kids doing physical movement and gives them new skills and interest.\"\nSome schools don't allow skateboarding because they say it is dangerous. Tim, however, argues that regular practice eliminates a great deal of the danger. \"We teach students how to do it and how to do it safely,\" he says.\nSome people say skateboarding teaches life lessons. \"Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with  something they will finally succeed.\" says education expert Richard Savor from College in Portland.\nSkateboarding encourages kids not to give up in learning difficult skills. \"It's natural for kids to want to learn and get better at things,\" adds Tim. \"When it comes to skateboarding, they'll try a trick hundreds of times before they succeed.\" The same effort could be made in schoolwork.\nEric Brown agrees that skateboarding requires kids to stop saying a task is too hard for them. \"A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before he or she is successful,\" says Eric, \"We tell students that they shouldn't say 'I can't do it' unless they've tried 600 to 900 times."

      "Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\"\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.\"\n\"Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.\"\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\"\n\"Why, isn't that work?\"\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\"\nThe brush continued to move.\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\"No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\"\n\"No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little.\" \"Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... \"\n\"Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.\"\n\"Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...\"\n\"I'll give you all of it.\"\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat --and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get."

      "The word proactivity is fairly common in management literature, but you won't find it in the dictionary. It means that as a human being you take responsibility for your own life.\nLook at the word responsibility: ability to choose your response, response-ability. Effective people are proactive because they take responsibility. Their behavior is a product of their own decisions, based on values, rather than being a product of their own conditions, based on feelings.For instance, you are planning a picnic with your family.You're excited.You have all the preparations.You've decided where to go, and then it becomes stormy, killing your plan.Proactive people\n. They realize what their purpose really was, and they creatively have a picnic elsewhere even if it's in their own basement with some special games, and make the best of that situation.The opposite of being proactive is to be reactive.Reactive people would say, \"What's the use?\" \"We can't do anything.\" \"Oh this is so upsetting after all of our preparations and arrangements.\" They try to persuade the people around them and usually the picnic will be cancelled.\nBeing proactive is really just being true to your human nature. Your basic nature is to act, and not to be acted upon.That's true, despite widely accepted theories of determinism used to explain human nature. Determinism says that you don't really choose anything and that what you call choices are nothing more than automatic responses to outside conditions.\nThe language of reactive people is like: \" I can't.\" \" Don't have time.\" \" I have to.\" \" I must.\" The whole spirit of that language is the transfer of responsibility.They think things are determined by their environment, or by their conditions, or by their conditioning or their genetic makeup.Psychologically, people who believe they are determined will produce the evidence to support the belief, and they increasingly feel victimized and out of control.They're not in charge of their life at all.\nOn the contrary, a proactive person exercises free will, the freedom to choose the response that best applies to his values.In that way, he gains control over the circumstances, rather than being controlled by them."

      "Farmer John and Farmer Bob were neighbors. For more than 30 years, they had been getting along very well.\nThen their good relationship broke. It began with a small thing, then bitter words, and then weeks of silence. One morning Farmer John woke up to find a stream between the two farms. \"It must be Bob,\" John thought.\nThen one day there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a carpenter  standing at the doorway.\n\"I'm looking for a few days' work,\" the carpenter said.\n\"I do have a job for you,\" John said. \"Look across the stream at that farm. That's my neighbor Bob. He dug a stream between the two farms. I want you to build a fence--an 8-foot fence. I don't want to see his place or his face any more. I don't have such a neighbor!\"\nThe carpenter said, \"I think I know what to do, sir, and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\"\nFarmer John helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.\nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide. There was no fence there at all!\nIt was a bridge! And the neighbor, Bob, was coming across, with his hand outstretched . \"Hi, John! _ \nThen they met in the middle, taking each other's hands. \"I'm terribly sorry for what I have said and done. We should be good to each other,\" said Farmer Bob.\nThen they turned to see the carpenter, who was ready to go. \"No, wait! Stay a few days.

Make sure you make a good one. Before your first day, find out if your new job has a dress code (rules about what you can wear to work). If so, be sure to follow it. No matter what, always be neat and clean.\n2. Get to work on time.\n3. Pay attention to introductions. One of the first things that your supervisor may do is to introduce you to co-workers. These co-workers will be important to you. They are the ones who will answer your questions when the boss is not around.\n4. Ask plenty of questions. Make sure that your supervisor has told you what is expected of you. If he or she has not told you your duties, ask for a list. Set daily and weekly goals for yourself.\n5. Never be the first one to leave. Observe  what your co-workers do around quitting time  . It does not look good for you to be eager to leave."

      "Choosing the Right Resolution  \nMillions of Americans began 2014 with the same resolution they started 2013 with, a goal of losing weight. However, setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake.\nTo reach our goal of losing weight --- the output, we need to control what we eat --- the input ( ). That is, we tend to care about the output but not to control the input. This is a bad way to construce goals. The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input. Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success. And it's easier to start again if you fail, because you know exactly what you need to do.\nIf you want to cut down on your spending, a good goal would be making morning coffee at home instead of going to a cafe, for example. This is a well-specified action-based goal for which you can measure your success easily. Spending less money isn't a goal because it's too general. Similarly, if you want to spend more time with your family, don't stop with this general wish. Think bout an actionable habit that you could adopt and stick to, like a family movie night every Wednesday.\nIn the long run, these new goals could become a habit."

      "Why are so many students not doing well? Why is there such a huge achievement gap between urban and suburban students? Just this week, in my school the seventh grade team leader called a meeting to discuss academic detention  . The purpose of the detention is to allow students who are doing poorly a second chance to redo the work. Now if a student did not understand an assignment I have no trouble allowing that student to redo a test or give some extra credit work, but if a student did poorly because he/she opted  not to do the work out of sheer laziness, that student should not be given a second chance.\n    And parents should be held accountable for their children. That is another reason why there is such a huge achievement gap. All children should be monitored at home in order to achieve great success in school. Perhaps it might be a great idea for urban school districts to offer free classes to parents on how to help their students at home. Of course this idea is far fetched, after all we do not want to offend the parents. What we will do instead is to spend a fortune on teacher training because if the kids are not doing well it must be the fault of the teacher. That kind of mindset, if allowed to continue will be a perfect recipe for greater achievement gaps.\n     I started working at my current school in August and I have been in the teaching field for 25 years. What I believe is that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make that  horse drink. You can't force kids to change bad habits over  night, nor can we afford to lower standards just so a kid can  pass a class."

      "Every one of us gets so used to punctuation marks that not many of us give them a secondthought.Actually,the ancient Greeks wrote this way.The lack of punctuation marks probably didn't bother good readers,though.As they read,they just put pauses where they fit best. Also at this time,sentences switched directions.A sentence read from leftto right.The next one read right to left,and then left to right again,etc.The ancient Romans sometimes punctuatedlike this:They put somethingthat can separate words in a sentence.The wordpunctuationactually comes from this idea andthe Latin word\"punctum\"which means a lot.\nWhen the 5th century arrived,there were just twopunctuation marks:spaces and points.The spaces separated words while the points showed pauses in reading.Then in the 13th century,a printer named Aldus Manutius tried to standardize punctuation.He always used a period for a complete stop at the end of a sentence.He used a slash(/)toindicate a short pause.Over time.that slash was shortened and curled,and it became the modern comma .\nSince that time,other marks have enlarged the punctuation family.The exclamation mark comes from the Latin word\"io\".It means \"exclamation of joy\".The question mark originally started out as the Latin word\"questio\",meaning\"question\".Eventually,scholars put it attheend of a sentence to show a question.\nPunctuation even keeps changing nowadays.New marks are coming into existence,and old punctuation marks are used in new ways.Take for example the\"interrobang\".This 1962 invention combines the question mark and exclamation mark for times when writers want both.For example.\"She did what?!\"or\"How much did you pay for that dress?!\"Obviously,the interrobang is not widelyused or recognized yet,but its invention shows that English is not yet finishedwith its punctuation."

      "In our daily life, many of us feel stressed more or less. Some like this pressure and work better because of it. Others are not comfortable with any stress at alls they soon become unhappy if they feel stressed. Sometimes stress can lead people to do things they wouldn't usually do, such as overeat, smoke, drink, or use drugs. Streas, however, is a very normal part of life.\nIt is important to understand that stress doesn't come from an event itself, that is, from the things that are happening in our lives. It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened. For example, a crying baby may be stressful to one person, but it may not bother another person at all, a traffic jam may be stressful to one person while another person may be able to stay calm.\nWe can experience stress any time we feel we don't have control. It can come from a feeling that we can't do anything about a situation. Basically, it is the body's way of showing anxiety or worry.\nStress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition. It is also influenced by how tired we are, whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals, whether we get enough physical exercise, and whether we can relax.\nThe key point of relieving the stress is that we need to find what is causing the stress in our lives. Once we have found it, we should try to change that part of out lives. If we believe that we can control stress, we can begin to control out lives. Then we can start to use stress in positive way."

      "California places limits on water use to deal with the state's four-year drought. Californians are feeling the heat after Governor Jerry Brown announced an order that puts mandatory  statewide water cutbacks into effect.\nCalifornia has faced water-use cutbacks in the past. In January 2014, Governor Brown called for residents to curb their water use by 20 percent, but many places around the state failed to meet that goal. This most recent announcement, however, marks the first time in the state's history that mandatory restrictions have been ordered.\nMost of California's water supply comes from the Sierra Nevada mountain range snowpack. Normally, during the spring and summer, this snow melts and puts new supplies into groundwater. but this past winter, the snowpack reached its lowest point since 1950. \"today we are standing on dry grass where there should be feet of snow\" announced Governor Brown.\nAs part of his order, Governor Brown called upon the state Water Resource Control Board to draft emergency rules for water use in the coming month. Cities and towns across the state must cut water usage by 25 percent. If city water agencies fail to meet these targets for water conservation, they could be fined $10,000 a day.\nThe state will also support local governments in replacing 50 million square feet of lawns with drought-tolerant plants that use less water. Outdoor lawn watering will be limited to two days per week, and residents will not be permitted to water their lawns during rainstorms and for two days afterwards. The order also asks local water agencies to raise the price of water to discourage excessive water use.\nGovernor Brown said change may not be easy, but it's necessary to ensure that residents can fill their water glasses into the future. \"it is a wake-up call,\" he said. \"it's requiring action and changes in behavior.\""

      "\"Hitler and the Germans,\" an exhibition in Berlin's German Historical Museum which aims to investigate the society that created Hitler, has seen more than 10,000 visitors walk through its doors since opening on Friday.\nRudolf Trabold, a spokesman for the museum, said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone. People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in. Ravi Nair, a 73-year-old Indian visitor, said: \"I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it. The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable.\"\nTrabold said \"Hitler and the Germans\" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years, in Vienna's men's hostels, could become an almost mythical leader of the German people. \"We are all affected by Hitler, so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past.\" Inge Lonning, a 72-year-old tourist from Norway said: \"I thought the exhibition was very impressive. I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child, so it's not just history for me.\" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition. \"So much has been done about this period over the years, it was like, I knew this and I knew that,\" said Canadian Julien Cayer, aged 28. \"I thought I'd find something new but I didn't.\"\nThere has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo-Nazi admirers of Hitler, but Trabold said that although there had been some right-wing extremist visitors, they had not caused any problems."

      "Harvard researchers have created a tough, low-cost, biodegradable   material inspired by insects' hard outer shells. The material's inventors say it has a number of possible uses and someday could provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic. The material, made from shrimp (') shells and proteins produced from silk, is called \"shrilk.\" It is thin, clear, flexible and strong.\nA major benefit of the material is its biodegradability. Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries. What is the point of making something that lasts 1,000 years?\nShrilk not only will degrade in a landfill, but its basic components are used as fertilizer , and so will enrich the soil.\nShrilk has great potential, the inventors said. Materials from which it is made are plentiful in nature, found in everything ranging from shrimp shells, insect bodies to living plants. That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material.\nWork on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments. They're also developing simpler production processes, which could be used for non-medical products, like for computer cases and other products inside the home. They're even exploring combining it with other materials, like carbon fibers, to give it new properties."

      "Climate change has been blamed for killer hurricanes, sea level rise, and drought, but a new report suggests the effects of climate change might hit the world's coffee supply. Up to 70 percent of the world's coffee supply could be threatened over the next 66 years, according to a new study by researchers at England's Royal Botanic Gardens.\nNearly 100 percent of the world's Arabica coffee growing regions could become unsuitable for the plant by 2080, according to the study. Beans from Arabica coffee plants account for about 70 percent of the world's coffee, but the plant also has to be grown under strict weather conditions: they grow well at temperatures between 64 and 70 degrees Celsius, and are highly influenced by frost or temperatures higher than 73 degrees Celsius.\nWith temperatures estimated to increase by between 1.8 and 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the fragile plant might become increasingly expensive and difficult to grow, especially in places such as Ethiopia and Kenya. In that worst case, nearly all of the world's native Arabica coffee would die out. Under more conservative estimates, about 65 percent of the regions used to grow the coffee would become unsuitable for it The evidence from coffee farmers and coffee growing regions around the world is that they are already suffering from the influences of increased warming.\nSome farmers would likely be able to move their operations to other areas or would be able to overcome climate change with artificial cooling techniques, but wild Arabica is generally considered to be much more suitable for making high-quality coffee.\nIf Arabica becomes impossible to raise in its native areas, it could do serious damage to the economies of the mainly third-world countries in which it grows. Coffee is the world's most popular drink and is the second most-traded product in the world, behind oil."

      "The literal meaning of philosophy is \"love of wisdom\". But this meaning does not tell us very much. Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict."

      "Have you ever wanted to achieve a goal and ended up doing tons of research on how to achieve the goal? As you learn more and more, it feels like you know less and less because when you learn something new, you find that there is a lot to know about those things.\nSometimes, people will get stuck in this needing to gather more and more information. There's nothing wrong with learning a lot, but when you let learning get in the way of doing, you will never get going. When you never get going, you still never start having the things you want. Too much learning can paralyze you in terms of taking action.\nA better way to go about achieving a goal is to gather some information and immediately start taking action on the information you have gathered. Many times you will feel unprepared, and that's OK. The best way to learn is to take action and learn from the results you get from those actions.\nWhen you are able to get past the fear of not being perfect and just take the first step, you will be further ahead than the majority of people who are still in the preparation stage. It's good to be prepared especially in situations such as a pilot and crew making sure the plane is ready to take off, but over-preparation in trying to reach a goal won't give you any results. The knowledge and skills you will need will be picked up along the way.\nIf a baby wants to learn how to walk, it will never be able to do it by sitting there and analyzing how to walk. The best way for a baby to walk is to actually stand up and start walking. Sure it may fall, but with every fall, it will learn what is working and what is not and adjust to _ . By doing this over and over again, it will eventually learn to walk. This is the approach you need to take when you want to achieve your goals as well. It works. Learning more is great but if all you're doing is learning and not taking action, it's time to change. Just take the first step!"

When you carry your goals into the competitive ground with you, chances are great that you will leave that performance with disappointment and heartache, and nothing more!\nExpectations will _ Expectations will distract  you from the performance and make your muscles tighten up. Want to perform to your potential when it counts the most? Then write your goals on a piece of paper before you leave for the game, match or race, and then leave that paper at home!  Make a deal with yourself to let go of your goals. Expectations and goals should be your training partner, used to motivate you to work harder during practice and take your game to the next level, However, never take your goals and expectations into a competition. You will not perform to your potential!\nGo into your competitions without any preconceived  ideas about the result. Forget the outcome!  Instead, keep your focus on what you're doing in the moment. Think of the competition as it unfolds, moment by moment. Relax at every opportunity by breathing deep and letting go of the tension in your muscles. When you do this you'll remain loose and relaxed.

      "The owner of an Alabama Chinese restaurant named \"Good Friend\" shot at a customer who complained about a fly in her eggroll Thursday night. The bullet narrowly missed 20-year-old Birmingham resident Jatari Walker who told the Daily News she is scarred by the entire experience.\n\"I can't sleep,\" she said Saturday afternoon. \"And since it happened I've had no appetite.\"\nWalker ordered a combination platter and eggroll from the Good Friend Chinese and Seafood Restaurant on Dennison Ave. Thursday evening. After paying her $7 bill she went back to her car and discovered a fly inside. \"I thought I need to take this back,\" she said.\nThe customer went back and asked for a repayment and said the owner Chun HinChing, 52, was unhappy with her because she announced her discovery in front of other customers. After an argument he repaid the money and Walker -- who is now a former frequent customer of the business -- turned and walked to the exit.\nThat's when Ching drew a handgun and fired a single shot over her head.\n\"He just shot the gun at me and I ran,\" she said, adding she could feel the bullet whiz past her head.\nBirmingham Police Department spokesman Lt. Sean Edwards told the News the owner was charged with attempted murder and was transported to Jefferson County Jail on $100,000 bail .\nPolice believe Ching intended to hit Walker with the bullet and missed, Edwards said. The bullet hit the top of the door frame of the take-out business.\nChing did not tell police why he fired at Walker, Edwards said.\nEdwards said he did not recall any previous problems at the business. He said Ching did not say why he had a weapon but added it was not uncommon for stores in that neighborhood.\n\"No one was injured from the gunshot\", Edwards said.\nCalls placed to the restaurant Saturday afternoon were not answered."

      "City farms are gaining popularity in cities and towns around the United States. \nCity Farms in Edmonston, Maryland, is located near shopping centers, car repair shops and homes. The neighborhood is a working-class community. People do not have very much money, and they have limited access to fresh food in markets. \nOver the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Alston Clark thinks his experience very valuable. \"I like coming out here, \"he says, \"You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more. \"\nMargaret Morgan-Hubbard started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. \"Growing food in a community and showing that you can have farms even in the city is helpful to strengthen the relationship in that community and brings people together, \"she continues, \"Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration to show people everything about how to have a sustainable community. \"she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost made from food waste. Sixteen wooden bins are filled with worms. Their job is to eat the food waste and help make it into compost. \nEco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the greenhouses are heated using a geothermal system. \nVegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bicycle to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest. \n\"I like eating the vegetables, \"says five-year-old Owen Moss."

One day, a \"nice man\" bearing flowers managed to steal 20 euros from her purse, while she was holding it in her hands. \"He said he was collecting for a church charity so I pulled out a euro,\" she explains, \"He said 'no, no, that's too much' and offered to look in my purse to find a smaller coin. He must have slid out that 20 euro note at the same time. I did not even notice until an hour later.

The most important of these loopholes is the fact that our brains are not set up to multi-task. Most of the time that is a good thing -- _ allows us to filter   out all but the most important features of the world around us. But a good trickster can use it to against you. This kind of trick involves capturing all of somebody's attention with other movements. Street pickpockets often use this effect to their advantage by manufacturing a situation that can not help but overload your attention system. Other strategies are more psychological. Pickpockets tend to hang out a \"beware of pickpockets\" signs, because the first thing people do when they read it is check they still have their valuables, helpfully giving away where they are.

Apollo Robbins, a stage pickpocket, said smart move, like moving your hand in an arc   motion rather than a straight line, is another popular strategy employed by tricksters.\nAt last, it should be pointed out that most thefts are opportunistic.

      "New rules and behavior standards for the middle school students came out in March. Middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye  their hair, smoke or drink. The following are some of the new rules.\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied others' work in an exam? Don't do it again if you did it before! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done your homework.\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is a bird-loving month in China. Did your school do anything to celebrate? If so, you should join it! In this way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, you can get more fun. Have you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. \nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover the truth someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nProtect yourself. Has anyone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. \nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for our studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can you find any good websites for children? Here are some.\nhttp: // kids. eastday. com; http: // www. chinakids. net.com; http:// www. cycnet. com."

      "Are you a big fan of pirate  stories? Do you know how to talk like a pirate? You can have fun on September 19th. This special holiday is called International Talk Like A Pirate Day. It was invented in 1995 by two young Americans, John Baur and Mark Summers.\nThese two good friends came up with this idea when they were playing racquetball, and began to talk like pirates. At that moment, they thought, \"Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?\" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day. As Baur said, \"We've talked like pirates, and encouraged several of our friends to do so every September 19th.\"\nAt first, this day was only known by a few people. In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.\nHaving fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.\nUnlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too. Because of Baur and Summers' imagination and creativity, thousands of young people's pirate dream come true. Next time, when you have a good idea, why not share it with your fiends and insist on your belief? Maybe you can create another wonderful holiday for the youth in the future."

      "About 10 years ago, I started a job as a trainer for a telemarketing agency.In one of my first classes, the head trainer told a very inspiring story.\nHe began by drawing a stickman standing in the middle of a circle.To make it more interesting, he drew things like a house, a car, and a few friends inside the circle.\nHe asked the question, \"Can anyone tell me what this is?\" In a long silence, one guy decided to throw out \"the world?\" The trainer said, \"That's close and this is your Comfort Zone.Inside your circle you have all the things that are important to you.\"\n\"Your home, your family, your friends, and your job.People feel that inside this circle they are safe from any danger or conflict.\"\n\"Can anyone tell me what happens when you step out of this circle?\" A strong silence came over the room.The same eager guy abruptly announced, \"You are afraid.\"\nAnother guy said, \"You make mistakes.\" The silence continued and the trainer smiled and said, \"When you make mistakes, what can the result be?\"\n         The first guy shouted, \"You learn something.\"\n\"Exactly, you are learning.\" The trainer turned to the board and drew an arrow pointing from the stickman directly to the outside of the circle.He continued to say, \"When you leave your Comfort Zone you put yourself out there, in front of the world to be in situations that you are not comfortable with.\"\n\"The end result is that you have learned something that you did not know and you expand your knowledge to become a better person.\" He turned again to the board and drew a bigger circle around the original circle, and added a few new things like more friends, a bigger house, etc.\n\"The moral of the story is that if you stay inside your Comfort Zone, you will never be able to expand your horizons and learn.When you step out of your Comfort Zone you will eventually make your circle bigger and your mind grow stronger, and all in all a better person.\""

      "A new study has been carried to test the role of story telling in lowering blood pressure. Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension   patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.\n   Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier. Hypertension is difficult to control, since it is dependent on diet, exercise and mental state. Medical treatments with drugs, and lifestyle therapies  have been  ly ineffective because people find it hard to follow those medical requirements.\n   In the test, his team carefully chose their story-tellers from 230 members of a patients' community with whom they could most easily relate. Next, they divided their study population into two groups. One received three interactive   DVDs containing the tellers' stories of their experiences in living with and treating their hypertension. The other were given educational discs on an unrelated health topic. The study volunteers reported that they had listened to the DVDs, and after three months, those who heard the stories of the hypertensive patients lowered their blood pressure.\n  While the study did not  _ how the story-telling influenced the patients' behavior, Houston suspects that watching patients of similar backgrounds who had a similar medical experience helped to motivate them to seek medical help to their hypertension. They found that after six months the difference in blood pressure between those who watched the story-tellers and those who observed the unrelated videos remained, suggesting that the story-telling continued to have an effect."

      "I grow up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\nDad was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the sea for his catch. When you got close to him, you smelled the ocean.\nWhen the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me good-bye!\nI remembered the day I thought I was too old for a good-bye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but  _ It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face.\nI said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a good-bye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss.\" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. I had never seen him cry. He turned and looked at the windshield . \"You're right,\" he said. \"You are a big boy...a man. I won't kiss you any more.\nIt wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back.\nGuys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek ...  to feel his rough old face ...  to smell the ocean on him ...  to feel his arm around my neck. I wish I had been a man then. If I had been a man, I would be a man. I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a good-bye kiss."

      "Have you ever been to a wedding and simply loved the bride's bouquet ?More than likely some part of it was the Hawaiian Wedding Plant. This foreign houseplant can be enjoyed by anyone, not just brides. With a little proper attention and careful planning on location, this foreign houseplant, which is from Madagascar, can be brought into the home where it can become an interesting focus.\nCaring for the Hawaiian Wedding Plant is not much different from caring for any other houseplants that may already be in your home. The only difference between this type of houseplant and others is the amount of the basic requirements that this foreign houseplant needs to survive and perform beautifully. During the growing season, this plant requires its wet soil, but when winter rolls around, this plant needs its soil to be kept drier.\nHawaiian Wedding Plants should also be potted in well-drained soil and placed in a location that receives full sun. That the soil must be kept wet does not mean that it should sit in water, so the soil must drain easily or this plant will not survive. Water the plant daily and feed this plant every two to three weeks with a little fertilizer  for acid-loving plants. Prune in early spring, even as early as February. If these needs are met, this plant will stay beautiful.\nThe most special feature of this foreign houseplant is its long lasting blooms combined with its unbelievable sweet smell.

      "If the crust   of the earth were not pretty solid  ,it would be shaking about and moving up and down frequently. However,there are places in the rocks of the earth's crust where it isn't strongly held together--where faults exist. Along the faults,one rock might push against another with great force. The energy is changed to vibration in the rocks,so they begin to shake and we have an earthquake!\nThe most famous one in North America was the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Seven hundred people died and property damage amounted to about $425,000,000.The greatest destruction came from the fires that followed the quake.\nOne of the most famous earthquakes in Europe took place in Lisbon,Portugal,in 1755.The city was destroyed and at least thirty thousand people were killed. In 1908,in Calabria and Sicily,a quake killed about seventy-five thousand people. In 1915,in central Italy,hundreds of towns and villages were damaged and thirty thousand people were killed.\nTwo great earthquakes that caused great damage in Asia took place in Tokyo,Japan,and in Gansu Province in China.

      "Borrowing to start a business is not easy. Getting a bank loan, particularly for a new small business, is _ \nBanks favor established-business people with a solid credit rating and a large bank account. They should also have experience in the business they propose to enter, and offer well-prepared business plans that show the ability to repay the loans. If you are not such a person, then you need to double your preparations to convince the banker to lend you that much needed start-up capital . If your business is new and small, bankers will need to know as much as possible about you and your business.\nHowever, many small business owners often make the mistake of not being well prepared when going to the bank to apply for the loan. Surprisingly, many loan applicants don't even have the slightest idea how or when they intend to repay the money they request. Often they don't even know how much money they need. When asked how much money they want to borrow, many people give these two common responses: \"How much money can I get?\" and \"As much as possible.\" Is it any wonder that lenders say no?\nSo the most important thing is do your homework before you ask for a loan."

      "Two studies are suggesting that some overweight people do not face an increased risk of developing heart disease. Researchers also found that some individuals of normal body weight have an increased risk of the disease.\nBeing overweight does increase your risk of medical problems, but the studies found that not all heavy people are less healthy than thin people.\nIn one study, American researchers examined medical records from over 5000 men and women. Each person had taken part in a separate study from 1999 to 2004. The searchers found that about 51% of them were overweight or obese. About 32% were obese, but considered metabolically healthy. This means they had no evidence of problems in tests for high blood pressure or other factors linked to heart disease. However, more than 23% of people who were at a healthy weight were unhealthy in two or more aspects Judith WylieRosett helped carry out the American study. She says the finding show that all obese person can still be healthy. She believes that having body fat is not as important as where the fat is found on body. It's reported that twothirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese.\nA second study is suggesting that fat in the liver may be an important health risk. Norbert Stefan and his team closely examined 314 people.They measured how much body fat each person had, and where it was on the body. To do this ,they used medical imaging tests. They discovered that obese people could have healthy hearts. Their results suggest that fat in the liver is more dangerous than fat in other areas.\nThe results of both studies were published recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine.Professor WylieRosett says the findings don't mean that people shouldn't be concerned about obesity.  Experts say there are several diseases linked to obesity that make it more dangerous to be fat than thin. They say people should see their doctor to learn what health risks they may be facing and what behaviours should be changed to improve health."

      "Opportunity knocked on my door last January when I was given a chance to work in another country. At first, it seemed really scary for me to live on my own. But I had to overcome the true challenge!\n    Luckily, I met seven new friends, six boys and one girl. They were really nice and I loved their company. We hung out most weekends. We cooked, watched movies, chatted and shared jokes! It was amazing -- until something unexpected happened !\n    One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney   stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible. But our friend could not afford the surgery. He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him. My heart cried for him! Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most.\n    I didn't know how to help him because I didn't have any money either. But I never lost hope. Instead I tried to think of other options. I told him not to worry because he might find a way somehow and everything would be all right.\n    So I went to the hospital with him. I talked to the surgeon, asking him to do the surgery for him and promising to pay the expenses the next day (As if I had that money). I must have been convincing because the surgeon agreed to do it! Now, how was I going to get that much money?\n    All I knew was that I needed to help my friend! I tried to borrow money from other friends but I failed. I tried selling my things but no one wanted them. Then I had to talk to my boss. I asked him if I could have my next two months salary in advance -- without even thinking on how I would survive for two months without money.\n    He was surprised and asked me why. I told him that I had a friend who was really in need.  Luckily, he gave my two months salary without hesitation! As soon as I had the money I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills.\n    Friendship may not only be found in happy moments. Sometimes you can find it on the toughest time in your life!"

      "It was 1961 and I was in the fifth grade. My marks in school were miserable and, the thing was, I didn't know enough to really care. My older bother and I lived with Mom in an ugly multi-family house in Detroit. We watched TV every night. The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses'  hoofs  from \"Wagon Train\" or \"Cheyenne\", and laughter from\"I Love Lucy\", or\"Mister Ed\".After supper, we'd lie on Mom's bed and stare for hours at the TV screen.\nBut one day Mom changed our world forever. She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library. I wandered reluctantly  among the children's books. I loved animals, so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals, I started leafing through them.\nThe first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder. It was about beavers . For the first time in my life I was lost in another world. No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home.\nIt didn't dawn on me at the time, but the experience was quite different from watching TV. There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes. And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page.\nSoon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world. I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. Sometimes I still can't believe my life's journey, from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position, which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery.\nBut I know when the journey began the day Mom switched off the TV set and put us in her Oldsmobile for that drive to the library."

      "Artie Shaw was born in New York City in 1910. His name was Arthur Arshawsky. His parents were poor immigrants who had come to the United States from Eastern Europe. His family later moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\nAt the age of fourteen, he began to play the saxophone and then the clarinet. From a very young age, Artie Shaw wanted to play his clarinet better than anyone. He wanted his sound and music to be perfect. He worked at this task much of his life.\nHe began working as a professional musician when he was fifteen. He left home and began playing in bands across the United States.\nIn 1928, young Artie Shaw traveled to Chicago, Illinois to hear the great trumpet player, Louis Armstrong. He immediately understood that Armstrong's great jazz sound was the beginning of something new and exciting. Artie left Chicago with a growing interest in jazz music. Soon after, he moved to New York City.\nHe got work playing the clarinet for the Columbia Broadcast System radio network. In 1936, he was given a chance to form a small group and play at New York's famous Imperial Theater on Broadway. His group was not the top band in the show. But the crowd loved his music. This proved to be a major step in his career.\nArtie Shaw was always trying something new, something different. He heard a young black woman sing and hired her for his band. This was the first time that a black woman sang with white musicians. Racial separation was the rule in many states. Artie Shaw did not care.\nArtie Shaw wrote several books in his later years. He wrote stories for magazines. He spoke about music at colleges and universities. But he had very little to do with the world of recording or music. During those years however, he received many awards and honors for his music. These included a Hall of Fame award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences."

      "The Queen's English is now sounding less upper-class, a scientific study of the Queen's Christmas broadcasts has found. Researchers have studied each of her messages to the Commonwealth countries since 1952 to find out the change in her pronunciation from the noble Upper Received to the Standard Received.\nJonathan Harrington, a professor at Germany's University of Munich, wanted to discover whether accent changes recorded over the past half century would take place within one person. \"As far as I know, there just is nobody else for whom there is this sort of broadcast records,\" he said.\nHe said the noble way of pronouncing vowels  had gradually lost ground as the noble upper-class accent over the past years. \"Her accent sounds slightly less noble than it did 50 years ago. But these are very, very small and slow changes that we don't notice from year to year.\"\n\"We may be able to relate it to changes in the social classes,\" he told The Daily Telegraph, a British  newspaper. \"In 1952 she would have been heard saying 'thet men in the bleck het'. Now it would be 'that man in the black hat'. Similarly, she would have spoken of 'the citay' and'dutay', rather than 'citee' and 'dutee', and 'hame' rather than 'home'. In the 1950s she would have been 'lorst', but by the 1970s 'lost'.\"\nThe Queen's broadcast is a personal message to the Commonwealth countries. Each Christmas, the 10-minute broadcast is put on TV at 3 pm in Britain as many families are recovering from their traditional turkey lunch .\nThe results were published  in the Journal of Phonetics."

      "Chocolate soap is supposed to be good for the skin. But it's not so good for the tongue. Unfortunately for the US soldiers of World War II, the chocolate bars the army gave them tasted like they were intended for use in the bath.\nIn the army's defense, it wasn't trying to win any cooking awards. In fact, it specifically ordered that its chocolate bars not be too delicious, so soldiers wouldn't eat them too quickly. These bars were created for survival, not taste. \"They were awful,\" John Otto, a former army captain in World War II said, \"They were big, thick things, and they weren't any good. I tried them, but I had to be awfully hungry after I tried them once.\"\nAs unappealing as the chocolate bars were to some, others like them. Samuel Hinkle, the chemist who created the chocolate bars, pointed out that the number of bars made were far greater than the army needed. \"It soon became obvious that the generous American soldiers were sharing their valued possessions with their foreign friends, whether soldiers of other countries or local citizens.\"\nThe bars turned many hungry Europeans into friends of the United States. \"People wanted them,\" said Otto. \"You'd give them to kids. In some places they were very hungry. And they surely helped relax people about American soldiers.\"\nOtto said he never saw a European _ the chocolate. \"It was food,\" he said. \"At that time, everyone was very hungry. I saw German kids standing outside the US army kitchen. They weren't begging, just standing there very politely. When we were done, the kids would eat the food out of the garbage. They were so hungry.\"\nOther Europeans did not see chocolate until well after the war ended. \"We didn't see any Americans where I was,\" said Elizabeth Radsma, who was 25 years old when the Germans occupied her country, the Netherlands. \"Even after the war, we saw only the British. Maybe the Americans gave out some chocolates in the big cities, but we were only in a small town. Before the British, we saw only German soldiers. But chocolate? Don't make me laugh! Maybe in my dreams!\"\nA soldier in the field might have responded \"Be careful what you wish for\"--and then gratefully bit on a chocolate bar, the only food available for miles."

      "We've all felt discouragement at one point or another in our lives. However, when this emotion bleeds into other aspects of our life, it can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful.\nI was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary.\nWe are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind.\nAdults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them.\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only. Students are responsible for seeking help from adults who are in authority  positions. They are also responsible for the way they approach adults in their academic surroundings. Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning. Generally the responsibility lies on both parties. When both sides can communicate in a polite manner then the complete environment of the school has the potential to develop well."

      "It's wonderful to go to another country, complete a volunteer project and feel that you really have a positive influence. But how can you become an international volunteer?\n* Plan practically. Contact the organization a few months before leaving and find out if there are materials which are rare and hard to attain for the project. What you often consider plentiful here, such as nails or hammers, is in great need in other parts of the world.\n* Do the project together, not on your own. You are a guest in the community. The most successful result is not that you build something and walk away, but that you and the community build something as a team. Share skills and build together.\n* Be flexible. Not everything is going to happen as planned. Often the other country doesn't have the right tools, manpower, transportation or funds to get all the needed work done. In a word, they lack infrastructure .\n* Contact with the people in the community. Often you will have \"downtime\" outside of the range of the project. Rather than retreat to the group with whom you traveled, be sure to spend time with the people of the community. Listen to the things about their lives. If you can't speak the language, smiles work wonders. And you will be surprised -- you will find a way to community.\nVolunteering is a special and life-long experience for everyone involved. Be prepared that the person who may be changed most is you. It's a joyful, often careful experience which will encourage you to view yourself, your neighbors and your world quite differently."

Now scientists say, it's a little bug that causes obesity .\n    As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives, millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures. But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas\nturkey or hot chocolates, but some bacteria in your guts .\n    Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity.\n    A research team led by Zhao Liping, a professor in Shanghai, has identified a precise link\nbetween a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain.\n    \"The endotoxin  released by the bacterium can activate  a gene that helps produce fat. And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,\" Zhao says.\n    Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in weight gain, but they had never been able to prove it.\n    In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.\n    While a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.\n    \"The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,\" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"But the problem is that we're only able to look at associations and aren't yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.\"\n     In the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria,\nleading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria, in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg.\n     Based on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized\nnutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts.\n     After 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared."

It will become smaller, but faster and more powerful.\nIt is possible to make some guesses about what the future of the computer will look like, based upon the types of technologies that are being developed now. A lot of progress has already been made in some of these new technologies, but some are still in their earliest stages and may not be ready for use for years. Two of the most interesting areas of computing that are currently being developed are quantum computing   and nanotechnology  .\nQuantum computing is one possibility for the future of the computer that could make computers run far faster than even the quickest computers do today. Quantum computers could be able to do what modern supercomputers are unable to do by using transistors that are able to take on many states at the same time.\nNanotechnology could also change the face of computing, by creating computers that could be very powerful, though they are tiny in size. These computers could be incorporated   into everyday objects, including electrical appliances  , clothes and even the human body. We will be able to use computers in new and unimaginable ways. They will become a part of our lives rather than simply being a box that is used only for specific purposes, such as work.\nQuantum computing and nanotechnology will be able to play new roles, which will make us live greener lives, as well as enjoy better health and happier lives."

We had just released our finest creation -- the Macintosh -- a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.\nHow can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions  of the future began to diverge(to be different) and eventually we had _ . When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was destructive.\nI really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down. I even thought about running away from the valley . But something slowly began to dawn on me -- I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\nI didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\nDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated  feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.\nI'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle."

      "Women had a significant part to play during World War II,which was the time when women also made their own contributions.Some women's great efforts and their names have been recorded in history.Here's a look at some of the strong figures of women in World War II.\nTatiana Nikolaevna Baramzina was born in Glazov of Russia on December 12,1919.In 1943,she was sent to the Central Women's Sniper Training School and upon her graduation in April,she was further sent to the front.She managed to kill around 16 enemies in the first three months!Unfortunately,she was captured  by the enemies and was killed on the fifth of July in 1944.Today,the street where she grew up has been renamed in her memory.\nAnne Frank was a Germanborn Jewish girl who was wellknown for the publication of her diary that described all her experiences when the Germans occupied Holland in World War II.Anne was born on June 12,1929 and she,along with her family,went into hiding in July 1942.Two years later,her family was captured and seven months from her arrest,Anne Frank died of illness in early March 1945.\nMargaret Ringenberg was born on 17 June,1921,in Indiana of America.She began her career during World War II when she became a ferry pilot for the Women Airforce Service Pilots.After that she turned a flight instructor in 1945.She even wrote her own book named Girls Can't Be Pilots.She passed away on 28 July,2008,after flying for 40,000 hours in the air.\nHannah Szenes was born on 17th July,1921 and was trained to parachute  by the British army into Yugoslavia during World War II.This task was given in order to save the Jews of Hungary.Her secret mission was not revealed even when she was tortured  following her arrest at the Hungarian border.Hannah Szenes had to brave immense tortures,yet she did not lose heart.She bravely battled it out and tried to sing to keep her spirits high!She also kept a record of events in her diary till 7th November,1944,when she was finally killed.\nThese names are just a few of the women who played a significant part in World War II.Their stories go a long way in showing the kind of lifestyles they led and their struggles and sacrifices."

      "While elephants are respected by the people of Thailand, they are also used as beasts of burdens  . Today, these majestic animals are extensively used to help carry wood for the logging industry. It is therefore nice to hear that on National Elephant Day the mighty mammals are treated like a king, and served with meals fit for a king.\nOne of the biggest celebrations took place at the Pattaya Resort in Thailand's Chonburi Province. Fifty-two elephants, some wearing beautiful clothes, arrived bright and early   for the big day. Each was first blessed with holy water by a professional elephant rider and then led to the grand feast, which served an unlimited supply of their favorite treats--bananas, dragon fruits  , pineapples, assorted melons, apples and the list went on and on! The elephants ate till they were satisfied before walking back with their owners for a good night's rest.\nThough called National Elephant Day, the celebrations that took place on March 13th this year stretched out for an entire week. Besides providing a well-deserved treat and break for the hard-working animals, the celebrations were also aimed to raise awareness about the mammal's dwindling   population. One smart elephant even helped show the message by painting a dead elephant and the words \"Don't kill me\", right beside _ .\nAnd horrible as the message may sound, there is a sad ring of truth to it. Since the 1900s the number of elephants in Thailand has gone from over 100,000 to just 3,000-4,000 because of the destruction of their natural habitat and illegal killing. Asian elephants are not the only ones that are in trouble. African elephants are facing the same fate  . Hopefully, the public and officials are now working together to save these mighty animals from disappearing from the world."

      "A growing number of workers at Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and other employers are trading in their sit-down desks for standing ones, saying they feel more comfortable and energized. They also are _ by medical reports saying that sitting for too long leads to increased health risks.\nA standing desk sits high off the floor so a worker can either stand at it or sit on a high stool to use it. Officials at Palo Alto-based Facebook say a number of employees asked about standing desks after news articles were published about the health risks of sitting all day.\nThe stories cited medical studies that tied excessive sitting to increased obesity and other health problems because of factors including a drop in physical activity. A 2010 study by the American Cancer Society found that women who sat more than six hours a day were 37% more likely to die prematurely than women who sat for less than three hours, while the early-death rate for men was 18% higher. The American College of Cardiology released a study in January that found increased mortality   among people who sat longer at home than those who didn't.\nNo one seems to compile statistics on the standing-desk trend. But anecdotal reports suggest Silicon Valley is embracing the movement.\nFacebook officials say they have seen an upsurge in requests for standing desks to five to eight a week with a total of between 200 and 250 deployed   at the company of more than 2,000 employees. Facebook also is trying out a treadmill station - where a worker can walk or run on a treadmill while tapping at a computer.\nGoogle spokesman Jordan Newman said that 'many employees at Google opt for standing desks, and we offer them as part of our wellness program' though he said he didn't know the exact number.\nGreg Hoy, 39 years old, asked for a standing desk shortly after joining Facebook seven months ago as a design recruiter. 'I don't get the 3 o'clock slump anymore,' he said. 'I feel active all day long.'"

There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 7 staircases, and 3 lifts.\nAt various times in history, the White House has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\". President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.\nThe White House receives approximately 6,000 visitors a day.\nWith five full-time chefs, the White House kitchen is able to serve as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres   to more than 1,000 people.\nThe White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.\nFor recreation, the White House has a variety of facilities available to people who live in, including a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater and a bowling lane.\nThe first US President to live in the White House was John Adams. Adams and his family moved to the White House in 1800, when the decoration of the building was not finished. And it was not until during Thomas Jefferson's term (1801-1809) that the decoration was finally completed.\nPresident John Tyler (1841-1845) was the first president to have his photo taken.

      "Ask a teacher to name the most annoying invention of recent years and they will often mention the mobile phone. Disturbed by the problems they create, many head teachers have ordered that pupils should keep their phones switched off at school. Others have told pupils to leave them at home.\nHowever, education researchers at The University of Nottingham believe it is time that phone bans were reassessed, because mobile phones can be a powerful learning aid, they say. Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and her colleagues have reached this conclusion after studying the consequences of allowing pupils in five secondary schools to use either their own mobile phones or the new generation of 'smartphones' in lessons.\nDuring the nine-month experiment, 14- to-16-year-old pupils used the phones for a wide range of educational purposes, including creating short movies, setting homework reminders, recording a teacher reading a poem, and timing experiments with the phones' stopwatches. The smartphones, which could be connected to the Internet, also allowed pupils to access revision websites, log into the school email system, or transfer   electronic files between school and home.\nThe research involved 331 pupils in schools in Cambridgeshire, West Berkshire and Nottingham. \"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young said. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more inspired.\"\nSome teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project. However, they recognized that greater use of mobile phones in schools could cause problems."

      "The worst days of any summer are the rainy ones. We spend all year looking forward to nice weather and long, hot days. In winter, with its cloudy days and bitter cold, we dream of those days at the beach, lying on the sand and enjoying the bright and burning sun. And then, summer comes, and it rains.\nAs a child, I would wake up to rainy summer days and come close to crying. It wasn't fair. We suffered through months of school and experienced bad weather for those short ten weeks of freedom.\nOn those rainy summer days, I had nothing fun to do and could only sit inside, staring out at the rain like a bird in a cage. I was an only child, so there was no one else to play with. My father worked from home, so I was not truly alone, but he could not actively play with me since he was at work. It was those days that I would watch whatever was on television or read any books that I could find lying around. I'd pray each night that the rain would not be there the next day.\nAs an adult, though, my opinion of summer rain has changed. When you have to work every day, summer is not as exciting. Everything seems uninteresting. Such a mindset makes you cheer for anything new or different. I spend the winter dreaming of summer and the summer dreaming of winter. When summer comes, I hate how hot it is. And then I look forward to the rain, because the rain brings with it a cold front, which makes me comfortable. Rainy days are still the worst days of the summer, but summer rain today means positively beautiful -- and quite cooler -- weather tomorrow."

      "Most people buy a lot of gifts just before Christmas. But some people think we buy too much. They have started a special day called Buy Nothing Day. They don't want anyone to go shopping on that day.\nBuy Nothing Day is November 29. It's 25 days before Christmas. It's after Thanksgiving Day and often the first day of Christmas shopping. At this time, we see ads in Newspapers and on TV telling us to \"buy, buy, buy!\"\nThe idea for Buy Nothing Day started in Vancouver, British Columbia. Now people all over the world celebrate Buy Nothing Day. In California, parents and children get together to read stories, sing songs, and paint pictures. The children talk about why they don't need a lot of toys. This year, in Manchester, England, people dressed up in costumes  to tell people that we buy too much.\nIn Albuquerque, New Mexico, high school students wanted to tell other students about Buy Nothing Day. They organized a spaghetti dinner to give people information about Buy Nothing Day. They asked restaurants in the neighborhood to donate  the food. They made posters and talked to other students about it. The dinner was a big success, and many students agreed not to buy anything on November 29. The students at high schools liked the idea of this new tradition. Next year, they want to have another dinner to tell more people about Buy Nothing Day!"

      "Many people turn to doctors or self-help books, but they forget a great thing that could help them fight illness: their friends.\nResearchers are only now starting to pay attention to the importance of friendship in health. A 10-year Australian study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die during the study period than those with fewer friends. A large 2007 study showed an increase of nearly 60 percent in the danger for _ among people whose friends gained weight. And last year, Harvard researchers reported that strong social ties  could improve brain health as we age.\n\"In general, the role of friendship in our lives isn't well realized,\" said Rebecca, a professor at the University of North Carolina. \"Friendship has a bigger effect on our psychological   health than family relationships.\"\nWhile many friendship studies are about the close relationships of women, some research shows that it can do good to men too. In a six-year study of 736 middle-aged men, having friendships reduces the risk of heart attack. Only smoking was as important a danger factor   as having little social support.\nThe exact reason why friendship has such a big effect isn't clear. While friends can send a sick person to the hospital or pick up medicine, the advantages go well beyond physical help. Friendship clearly has a big psychological effect. \"People with stronger friendships feel like there is someone they can turn to,\" said Karen, a doctor. \"The message of these studies is that friends make your life better.\""

      "A thief who dropped a winning lottery ticket at the scene of his crime has been given a lesson in honesty. His victim, who picked up the ticket, then claimed the PS25000 prize, managed to trace him, and handed over the cash. The robbery happened when maths professor Vinicio Sabbatucci,58, was changing a tyre on an Italian motorway. Another motorist, who stopped  \"to help\", stole a suitcase from his car and drove off. The professor found the dropped ticket and put it in his pocket before driving home to Ascoli in eastern Italy.\n    Next day, he saw the lottery results on TV and, taking out the ticket, realized it was a winner. He claimed the 60 million lire  prize. Then he began a battle with his conscience. Finally, he decided he could not keep the money despite having been robbed. He advertised in newspapers and on radio, saying: \"I'm trying to find the man who robbed me. I have 60 million for him--- a lottery win. Please meet me. Anonymity  guaranteed.\"\n    Professor Sabbatucci received hundreds of calls from people hoping to trick him into handing them the cash. But there was one voice he recognized--- and he arranged to meet the man in a park. The robber, a 35-year-old unemployed father of two, gave back the suitcase and burst into tears. He could not believe what was happening. \"Why didn't you keep the money?\" he asked. The professor replied:\" I couldn't because it's not mine.\" Then he walked off, spurning the thief's offer of a reward."

      "To err is human. To blame the other guy is even more human.\nCommon sense is not all that common.\nWhy tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?\nThese three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this: \" To err is human, to forgive, divine .\"This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine.Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \"the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\"\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if good excuse is \"good\" even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?"

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Sunday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get something to eat since we had enough time.\nWhen we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as if he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something to drink. However, it was not this that moved  me.\nA dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed that the dog was a mother and that she had just had some puppies . She was hungry and weak and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not live on.\nPeople walking by didn't even notice her. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved  better. But we still did not do anything, someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went back into a store and bought dog food with all the money he had.\nI know that this story isn't as inspirational as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives.

      "In a world with limited land, water and other natural resources, the harm from the traditional business model is on the rise. Actually, the past decade has seen more and more forests disappearing and the globe becoming increasingly warm. People now realize that this unhealthy situation must be changed, and that we must be able to develop in sustainable ways. That means growth with low carbon or development of sustainable products. In other words, we should keep the earth healthy while using its supply of natural resources.\nToday, sustainable development is a proper trend in many countries. According to a recent study, the global market for low-carbon energy will become three times bigger over the next decade. China, for example, has set its mind on leading that market, hoping to seize chances in the new round of the global energy revolution. It is now trying hard to make full use of wind and solar energy, and is spending a huge amount of money making electric cars and high-speed trains. In addition, we are also seeing great growth in the global markets for sustainable products such as palm oil, which is produced without cutting down valuable rainforest. In recent years the markets for sustainable products have grown by more than 50%.\nGovernments can fully develop the potential of these new markets. First, they can set high targets for reducing carbon emissions and targets for saving and reusing energy. Besides, stronger arrangement of public resources like forests can also help to speed up the development. Finally, governments can avoid the huge expenses that are taking us in the wrong direction, and redirecting some of those expenses can accelerate the change from traditional model to a sustainable one.\nThe major challenge of this century is to find ways to meet the needs of growing population within the limits of this single planet. That is no small task, but it offers abundant new chances for sustainable product industries."

      "Many adults in the United States can remember crying the nursery rhyme in the street \"Hot cross buns!\" But only a few people realize this was an early form of advertising.\nWritten advertisements probably began with hieroglyphics more than three thousand years ago, but only a few people could read these symbols. So merchants made signs with pictures or hung their tools over their doors to identify their businesses.\nIn the time of the Roman Empire, wall paintings were a popular form of advertisement. An ad for a play, or some other performance was painted on part of a building or on a wall around a city. People often advertised a house for rent or a freshwater bath in this way, too.\nToday, large wall signs are still used for outdoor advertising. But outdoor advertising is only a small fraction of the total advertising. About forty per -cent of all ads are printed in daily newspapers. Radio commercials also provide this kind of information. Some people think they are the best form of advertising because radio broadcasts reach almost everyone in a nation.\nAdvertisements in magazines and on television reach many people, too. However, usually only large companies can advertise on a national network, because TV commercials shown across the country can cost many thousands of dollars.\nThen there are ads that are almost part of daily living. If you use public transportation, you will see large printed ads, called ear cards, on buses and taxis and in trains. Ads are painted on the trucks that deliver products people are buying or selling."

      "One of India's great economic advantages is the   youth of its population. To make the most of this advantage, India's children need to be educated. On paper, India is doing well here. The country has a nationwide network of state primary schools funded by a specially designed tax. 96% of children aged 6-14 go to school, even in rural areas. That's well above the average for the developing world and their attendance is good. But the attainment is poor: three quarters of third graders can't read a gradeone text and 53% of grade five kids can't read at the standard they should have achieved at grade two. Levels of achievement are almost as bad in math. \n\"The main problem in India is not school entry or whether there is a local school; it's the delivery of education, the way teaching is done or not done,\" says Vinati Sukhdev, the executive director of Pratham, a charity that campaigns for better education in India. And according to Ms. Sukhdev, the country's teachers are the thirdbestpaid in the world but they're poorly trained and are often absent. Teacher attendance at the primary level is only 85%, according to Pratham's research and there's little punishment for those who don't turn up. \nThe government knows that state schooling needs to improve. In 2009 it passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), a law for the national provision of free, childfriendly education. It says that there should be two teachers for every 60 students and that they should go to work regularly, get there on time, follow the curriculum, assess how well the children are learning and meet regularly with parents. \n\"What we need to do next is improve accountability ,\" says Ms. Sukhdev. Schools have management committees that are supposed to include parent and local government representatives. \"But they don't work or people don't know they exist.\" Pratham tries to help local communities and parents drive improvement. \"You should see the kind of reaction we get when they realize the teacher is paid but isn't turning up!\"says Ms.  Sukhdev. \"We can't be everywhere, so we limit ourselves to working in a few districts, where we can create model schools. Then we try to work together with local government to make sure every school in the district or state is raised to that level.\"\nThe Read India programme is an example of what targeted help can achieve. Pratham has created an easytouse teaching and assessment pack called Learn to Read. It has trained teachers in how to use the pack at school and showed community health workers, volunteers and parents how it could support learning outside school. The programme has now run across 19 states, involving 450,000 volunteers and training 600,000 teachers and government workers. Among the 33 million children who have participated, the number of those who can read simple sentences has risen by 20%."

      "Rob Coulter worked in the wild of South Africa. He knew the animals, insects, and reptiles of Africa very well. Rob knew them so well that he became careless. \n   One night, while camping alone, Rob reached out to pick up a large piece of wood and felt something bite his arm. Rob didn't think much about it. But a little later, his arm began to ache. When he looked closely at it, he immediately saw two teeth marks in the skin of his arm. He realized that a poisonous snake had bitten him. His pulse became rapid. \n   Rob's mind raced as he thought about what he had to do to survive. Rob knew that he should remain calm, stay still, keep the injured arm below the level of his heart and avoid eating or drinking anything, especially anything with alcohol in it. He also knew that cutting the wound to suck the poison out was a bad idea. \n   He used his two-way radio to call for help. As he waited, he washed the bite with soap and water. To help slow the spread of the venom , he wrapped a bandage two inches above the bite and made it loose enough to slip a finger under it so that it would not cut off the flow of blood. Then, after about half an hour, his friend Mike arrived. Mike took Rob to the local hospital, where Rob was given antivenin--an antidote for snake venom. \n   Rob still enjoys camping, but he is now very careful not to disturb snakes."

      "In the late 1960's, many people in North America turned their attention to environmental problems, and new steel-and-glass skyscrapers were widely criticized. Ecologists pointed out that a forest of tall buildings in a city often overburdens public transportation and parking lots.\nSkyscrapers are also consumers and wasters of electric power. In one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscrapers office space in New York City raised the peak daily demand for electricity by 120,000 kilowatts--enough to supply the entire city of Albany, prefix = st1 /New York, for a day.\nGlass-walled skyscrapers can be especially wasteful. The heat loss ( or gain) through a wall of half-inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical brick wall filled with insulation   board. To lessen the strain on heating and air-conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double-glazed panels of glass, and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that reduce glare  as well as heat gain.\nHowever, mirror-walled skyscrapers raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings.                \nSkyscrapers put a strain on a city's sanitation facilities ,too. If fully occupied, the two World Trade Center towers in New York City would alone produce 2.25 million gallons of wastes each year-as much a city the size of Stanford,Connecticut, which has a population of more than 109,000.\nSkyscrapers also affect television reception, block bird flyways and air traffic, In Boston in the late 1960's, some people even feared that shadows from skyscrapers would kill the grass on Boston Common. Still ,people continue to build skyscrapers for all the reasons that they have always built them-personal pride and the desire of owners to have the largest possible amount of space to rent."

For more information, you can visit our website which is printed on the cover.\n     Attendance:\nPlease contact the office at 480. 472. 5282 if your child is going to be absent.\n     Renaissance Reading:\nThe Accelerated Reader (AR) Program is a computerized reading enrichment program that combines great children's literature with computer skills. As an individualized reading program, it is designed to motivate students to read more and to read good literature. Students of different abilities can use this program. It is not a competitive program but one that improves any student's reading ability.\n     Here is how it works. Students select books in their reading range from our Accelerated Reader Selection and read it at their own pace. Once the student has completed the book, he/she is ready to take an AR quiz. Each quiz consists of 5, 10, or 20 multiple choice comprehensive questions about the book.\n     After taking the quiz, the computer shows the student how many questions he/she answered correctly, shows the correct answers for missed questions, and praises the students' efforts with an onscreen personalized message. Passing the quiz assures the teacher and the parent that the child actually read and understood the book.  Each student tests independently--reading the quiz questions himself/herself.\n     The computer keeps track of reading points, books, and average test scores, as well as other data. A student may test on a book only once and should, therefore, have thoroughly read and understood the contents before taking the quiz. Each student is responsible for reading the screen to be sure the quiz, by title and author, is the correct one he/she wishes to take.\n     Students are recognized for their accomplishments with praise from the teachers and special recognition at the classroom level when individual and/or classroom goals are met.\n     P.

      "We human beings haven't been good friends to animals. For thousands of years, we have been polluting the environment, making it hard for animals to live on the planet. We have been killing animals for their fur, feathers or meat, or simply because they are dangerous. As a result, many kinds of animals have disappeared forever. Hundreds more are on the endangered list today.\nShould we care about animals? Of course we should. If animals of a certain kind all disappear, they will never come back again. Animals are more than just resources of things we need. Every kind of animal has its place in the balance of nature. Destroying any kind of animal can lead to many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks, the corn and grain that the farmers stored were destroyed by rats and mice. Why?  Because hawks eat rats and mice. With less and less hawks to keep down their numbers, rats and mice multiplied quickly. And if people kill too many birds, more and more insects will eat the crops.\nLuckily, we've realized that we shouldn't kill animals any more. And people are working hard to save those animals that would disappear soon. The government also passed laws to protect the endangered animals. In fact, quite a few countries have passed such laws. These laws forbid the killing of any kind of animal on the endangered list. We should try our best to protect and save the endangered animals."

      "Children will find it more difficult to buy cigarettes as vending machines selling tobacco will be officially banned in England today.According to the British Heart Foundation(BHF),around 200,000 young people start smoking regularly in England each year and 11 per cent of l1-to15-year-old regular smokers in England and Wales get their cigarettes from vending machines.\n    Betty McBride, Director of Policy and Communications at the British Heart Foundation,said,\"Thousands of children who are at risk of addiction regularly get tobacco from these machines,which of course,don't ask them to prove their age.With the tobacco industry increasingly depending on young smokers to keep their profits,they're fighting tooth and nail to stop any changes that might hit their bottom line.\"\n    The ban, which makes it illegal to sell tobacco from vending machines and requires shopkeepers to ensure all tobacco advertising on the machines is removed,comes into force in England today.It is the first ban in Europe to prohibit selling cigarettes from vending machines.which shows the determination of England to fight against smoking.\n   Other measures to protect young people from the dangers of smoking are also on the way.In April 2013 large retailers in England and Scotland will have to get rid of all tobacco displays and small shops will be expected to do that from April 2015.Wales and Northern Ireland also plan to make similar regulations.\n   The UK Government is due to begin a public consultation before the end of the year on whether to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes which would reduce their marketing appeal to young people,help to make health warnings more effective and,alongside other measures,help to reduce the number of smokers in the long term."

      "An American research company shows that $248.7 billion online sales are expected by 2014. It seems as if we can't get enough of spending money through countless online clicks today. Following are some of the incredible things that you can buy online!\n1) Parents\n51-year-old Michael Amatrudo from Connecticut put a posting on Craig list in 2009 to sell his elderly parents, asking for $155 in return.\n2) Chewing Gum\nBidding for Britney Spears' chewing gum reached $14,000 in 2004. The pop star's half-eaten sandwich also went for over $500.\n3) Kidney Stone\nStar Trek actor William Shatner sold his kidney stone for $20,000 when he put it up for sale online to see how much a piece of him was worth. He ended up giving the money to charity.\n4) An Imaginary Friend\nThis imaginary guy went (or might still be going) by the name of Jon Malipieman and was sold on eBay for $3,000 by a man who claimed:\n\"My imaginary friend Jon Malipieman is getting too old for me now. I am now 27 and I feel I am growing out of him. He is very friendly. Along with him, I will send you what he likes and dislikes, his favorite things to do and his personal self portrait.\"\n5) Souls\nThe website demonical.com is probably the creepiest site I have ever visited. You can sell your own soul or buy the souls of people such as Fidel Castro and Woody Allen (both selling for $950). Bill Gate, whoever that is, has his soul for sale at $1,300 while Michael Jacobsen's soul is being sold for $3000.\n6) A Rock That Looks Like Meat\nThe screen shot from eBay tells us that people are bidding over $1 million for this \"naturally formed bbq pork rock\".

      "I was now in my twenty third year of residence in this island and was accustomed to the place and to the manner of living. If it had not been the savages who had come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to spent the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave.\nI had also arrived to some little recreations and amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before.\nAt first, I had taught my Poll to speak. And he did it so familiarly and talked so clearly and plain that it was very pleasant to me. And he lived with me no less than twenty six years. How long he might live afterwards, I don't know; though I know they have an idea in Brazil that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling Poor Robin Crusoe to this day. I wish no other English man had the bad luck to go there and hear him. But if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil .\nMy dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me, for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age.\nAs for my cats, they multiplied to that degree that I had to shoot several of them at first to keep them from eating up all I had.\nBesides these, I had two more parrots which talked pretty well and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first. Nor indeed did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him.\nI had also several sea-fowls, whose names I don't know, that I caught upon the shore and cut their wings. And the little stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick bush, these fowls all lived among these low trees and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that as I said above, I began to be well content with the life I led if not worried about the threat from the savages."

      "According to Andrew, it never would have happened if he had not had a flat tire on Highway 10 last night at about 7:30. He was on his way to attend a three-day sales meeting when he had the flat. tyre. Unfortunately, he did not have a spare, so he pushed the car off the road, locked it up, and managed to thumb a ride back to Pine Grove. It was after eleven o'clock when he finally got home, and it was then that his real problems started.\nWhen Andrew left home at about 5:30, he had told his wife not to expect him back until Thursday or Friday. Knowing that his wife was nervous about staying in the house alone at night, Andrew took the precaution of checking all the windows in the house to be sure they were locked, so that he could report to his wife that the house was secure. He convinced his wife that the house was burglar-proof, and that she would be perfectly safe, providing she bolted  the front door as soon as he drove away.\nAndrew's only thought as he made his way in the dark to his front door was how surprised his wife was going to be to see him, since he was not supposed to be back until Thursday or Friday. He had forgotten about the bolt on the front door. When he turned his key in the lock and the door wouldn't _ he remembered the bolt. And he remembered that he had carefully locked all of the windows.\nAlthough Andrew didn't know it at the time, a next-door neighbor had seen him approaching the house and had watched him go up the steps to the front door. In the dark, it was impossible for the neighbor to recognize Andrew, and, besides, the neighbor knew that Andrew had gone out-of-town for a three-day meeting. As a matter of fact, Andrew had asked the neighbor to keep an eye on the house while he was gone.\nFinding that he couldn't get in, Andrew began pounding  on the front door to get his wife to open the door. According to Andrew, however, his wife is a very sound sleeper, and he knew it was going to be hard to wake her up. In the meantime, because of all the noise he had been making, the neighbor was convinced that somebody was trying to break into the house; so she called the police.\nWhen we talked to Andrew at the country jail this morning, he said that he still didn't understand how the police managed to circle the house without his seeing them. He stated that he had decided the only way to get in was to break one of the dining room windows, and that he was about, to hurl his briefcase into the window to break it when two of the officers grabbed him from behind.\nAndrew could not make the officers believe that he lived there; so they took him off to jail. Apparently, he did succeed in convincing them that they ought to wake up the woman in the house to check his story. But there was no answer when they knocked at the door. He tried to explain to them that his wife was a very sound sleeper, but they concluded there was nobody in the house."

      "Many people hate wet, sticky August, but to some, it's an especially bitter time. A new working paper finds that, March and August are the months in which divorce filings peak.\nFor the paper, the University of Washington's Brian Serafini and Julie Brines analyzed the most recent years of divorce filings in Washington and drew their conclusion: divorce rises sharply in March and August. The result is supported by some nation-wide, anecdotal evidence. Online searches for \"divorce\" and \"child custody\"  dramatically grow early in the year, peaking in March, they point out.\nThe authors guess that unhappily married couples schedule their divorce filings around both the winter holidays and Valentine's Day, as well as summer vacations. (More Americans vacation m July than any other month.)\nThere are a few explanations why people might time their marital dissolutions this way, It might just be too difficult to announce a divorce around family-oriented Christmas time, especially if there are kids involved, so many couples weigh the decision to divorce around the new year and progress from there. February is a period in which couples tend to look around for representation on legal sites. And by March, they're prepared to file for divorce.\nBut the authors think the more likely reason is that people decide their differences are irreconcilable right after a big trip. It could be that people don't want to ruin a family getaway, or that vacations are so stressful that they drive the already-dissatisfied to divorce. (\"I told you to pack your suitcase last night; now we've missed the train!\")\nThen there's the \"broken promise\" theory. \"6People are discontent with their marriages, they look at vacation as an opportunity to give it one last shot, and what they were hoping would happen didn't occur,\" explained Brines, an associate professor of sociology.\nIt's not you; in other words, it's your failure to print the boarding passes."

      "My parents knew their wealth: each other, their six children, and their faith. They tried to live simple lives so that they could have time for what was most important.\nThey didn't busy themselves buying a bigger house, because that would mean working harder to pay the monthly mortgage ,working overtime or taking second job. Who would go running with me then? Who would read stories to me?\nThey didn't burden themselves with buying an expensive car because that would mean worrying about installment  bills. Besides, walking to the shopping centre every Saturday afternoon with me gave my dad his needed exercise, and made me feel so special.\nOne of my heart's delights was seeing Dad and Mom in their bedroom at night, after our nightly family prayer. The lights were turned off, and I'd see the figure of my father seated on his old chair and Mom standing behind him, gently massaging  his shoulders.

      "Throughout the world, clothing has many uses. It is used to provide protection from cold. It is also worn to prevent others from seeing specific parts of one's body. However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status , intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender .\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English \"punks\" are essential aspects of their uniforms.\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing - deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive."

      "Nigel received a reward for his excellence in study. It began when he was selected to help the teachers in the computer laboratories.\nThe peak of his school career came not when he topped the school but when he was selected for the nationwide competition. Unlike everyone else, Nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked making something out of the Lego sets. Nigel spent the next two months rebuilding the robot. It was during the time that Nigel found out about the prizes for the competition as well as another competitor, Alicia, from a neighboring school. His early intentions were forgotten. Getting the thousand-dollar prize was more important than anything else. Nigel decided to befriend Alicia. Unaware of his intentions, she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition. He even helped her to put the finishing branches to her robot. He was glad with the way things had progressed. His robot was able to become a ball with its arms, which Alicia had failed to do.\nEverything didn't dawn on her until she saw him among the competition. She stared at him, puzzled at first, then angry and finally a look of helplessness came over her.\nThe flashbulbs of the camera exploded in Nigel's try. The robot bird performed actions so unique that the specialist judgments were the same. Nigel was so personal with himself that he did not even notice the girl standing a few feet away from him.

When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger.\nBut having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to  _ , things can work out just fine.\nWhen you first meet your roommate, chances are that you'll be on your best behavior. You want to get along since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential worst cases, too.\nFor example, imagine it's 2 am and you're working on a paper that's due in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room.\nAt times like these, you can't be feeling good. That's why talking about issues that might come up ahead of time and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes is so important.\nTalk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same.\nFor instance, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start. There are some things to talk to your roommate about so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes and habits."

      "Homeschooling is the education of children at home, typically by parents but sometimes by tutors, rather than in public or private school. As a matter of fact, most childhood education occurred within the family or community.\nHomeschooling is a legal choice for parents in developed countries to provide their children with a learning environment at home. Parents see many reasons for homeschool, including better test results, improved instruction, to help the public system with fewer kids, poor public school environment, religious reasons, improved character development, the expense of private education, and objection to what is taught locally in public school.\nHomeschooling can also be a choice for families living in remote   locations, living abroad, and to allow for more traveling. Also many young athletes and actors are taught at home, where a coach   or tutor is with the child for many years and then knows the child very well.\nIn some places, an approved curriculum   is required if children are to be home-schooled.

      "TANG Dynasty writer Du Mu once wrote in a poem titled Qingming: \"The ceaseless drizzle drips all the dismal day; So broken-hearted fares the traveler on the way.Where can a wine house be found to drown his sadness ?A cowherd points to Almond Flower (Xing Hua) Village in the distance.\"\nQingming, the traditional tomb-sweeping day on the Chinese lunar calendar, falls on April 4 this year. Qingming Jie was proclaimed a Chinese national holiday in 2008. It is a time for remembering loved ones who have departed  . People visit their ancestors' graves to sweep away the dirt and get rid of any weeds. They also leave offerings   of food and flowers, and burn incense   and paper money. Chinese tombs are usually built in the woods or on mountains, far from the city. It is believed that an area that faces south, with many pine trees, is a proper place for a tomb. People believe such a place will make the ancestors happy, and in return, they will look after the living family.\nNowadays, more and more residents are choosing environmental-friendly ways to spend the holiday such as flower sacrifices and memorial ceremonies on the Internet or at home. As one of the traditional ways to celebrate Tomb-sweeping Day - burning paper or incense - isn't exactly good for air quality.\nIn contrast to the sadness of the tomb sweepers, people also enjoy hope of Spring on this day. The Qingming Festival is a time when the sun shines brightly, the trees and grass become green and nature is again lively. Since ancient times, people have followed the custom of Spring outings. At this time tourists are everywhere.\nMany people fly kites on Tomb Sweeping Day. They are usually made from a bamboo crossbow with coloured paper. The kite vibrates and buzzes as it rises into the sky, counterbalanced by its tail. Large kites can be as broad as three metres across, with a tail of six to ten metres. Most kites have a rectangular shape, and many have patterns of crabs, centipedes, butterflies, dragonflies, or Chinese characters such as \"good fortune\" or \"long life\". (361words)"

      "As many people hit middle age, they often start to notice that their memory and mental attention are not what they used to be. We suddenly can't remember where we put the keys just a moment ago, or an old friend's name, or the name of an old band we used to love. It happens to most of us, but is it unavoidable?\nScientists are increasingly showing that there's actually a lot that can be done. It turns that the brain needs exercise in much the same way as our muscles do, and the right mental workouts can improve our basic cognitive  functions.\nNow, a new San Francisco Web-based company has taken it a step further and developed the first \"brain training program\" designed to actually help people improve and regain their mental sharpness. Called Lumosity, it was designed by some of the leading experts from Stanford University. Lumosity is far more than an online place to exercise your mental skills. That's because they have combined these exercises with a Web-based program that allows you to systematically improve your memory and attention skills.\nApparently it works. One study showed students improved their scores on math tests by 34 percent after using Lumosity for six weeks, greater gains than those made by other students in the same class, who were not training with the Lumosity program. The company says its users have reported clearer and quicker thinking, improved memory for names, numbers, directions, increased alertness  and awareness, high mood, and better concentration at work or while driving."

      "For the first time in Hong Kong's history, an entertainer has been written into middle school textbooks. He is considered one of the best actors in Hong Kong. Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat.\nThe example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed.\nOn hearing about this, Chow said happily, \"I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.\"\nIndeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life.\nChow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including \"Shanghai Bund\"(<<>> ) and \"A Better Tomorrow\". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world. In 1998, the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as \"Chow Yun-fat Day\"."

      "Facebook users may feel socially successful in the web world but they are more likely to perform poorly in exams. The majority of students who use Facebook every day are doing badly compared with those who don't. About 83% of British 16 to 24-year-old people are using social networking site such as Facebook and MySpace, to keep in touch with friends and organize their social activities.\n\"Our study shows people who spend more time on Facebook spend less time studying,\" said Aryn Karpinski, a researcher. \"Every generation has its distractions , but I think Facebook is a unique phenomenon.\" Karpinski and a colleague questioned 219 US undergraduates and graduates about their study and general Internet use, as well as their specific use of Facebook. They found 65% of Facebook users accessed their account daily, checking it several times to see if they had received new messages. The amount of time spent on Facebook at each log-in  varied from just a few minutes to more than an hour.\nSome UK students have already realized the potential danger. Daisy Jones, 21, an undergraduate, realized the time she was spending on Facebook was threatening her grades, urging her to deactivate  her account, \"I was in the library and tried to write a 2,000-word essay when I realized my Facebook habit had got out of hand,\" she said. \"I couldn't resist going online, when thinking about it. Before you know it , a couple of minutes have turned into a couple of hours and you haven't written a word.\"\nJones is among the few to have realized the risks. 79% of the users, however, believed the time they spent on the site had no impact on their work. The CEO of Facebook said, \"There is also academic research that shows the benefits of services like Facebook. It's in the hands of students to decide how to spend their time.\""

      "On the way home from school, Jack always passes a park. His mother said it was dangerous to pass by the park at night, but it is the fastest way home. Today, after finishing soccer practice, Jack was walking toward the park as usual.\nSuddenly, Jack heard someone calling him, \"Excuse me!\" Jack turned around, and there was an old woman. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Jack answered politely. \"Don't pass by the park tonight.\" Her voice was weak and dry. \"Okay, ma'am,\" said Jack carelessly. The old woman held Jack's hand strongly, and said, \"I mean it!\" Jack felt the hairs on his neck stand up. As soon as the lady let go of his hand, he started to run. This time, he ran so fast that he didn't have time to think where he was going.\nWhen he stopped, he realized he was in the middle of the park. He remembered what the old woman had said, but it was too late. He thought, \"It would be okay if I run really fast.\" Suddenly, he heard someone scream . Jack was too frightened to wonder who it was. He breathed as deep as possible. The screaming continued. He heard some fast footsteps approaching, so he turned around. It was the old lady! She walked toward him, and shouted \"I told you not to come here!\"\nFrightened to death, Jack screamed sharply and ran home like an arrow. He thought he heard not only the old lady, but also some other people shouting at him, and it made him more terrified. As soon as Jack saw his mother, Jack said, \"Mom! Do you know what just happened at the park?\" Jack's mother nodded, and said, \"Yes, I know. There is a movie shooting tonight in the park.\""

      "With around 40,000 students, the Politecnico di Milano is the largest and most technical university in Italy, offering undergraduate, graduate and other courses in engineering, architecture and design. Founded in 1863, just two years after Italy was united, Milan Polytechnic is international famous. Many of its graduates now work in big companies abroad like M.I.T., Caltech and Oxbridge.\nYet the Politechnic has a problem. As you know, here in Italy people speak Italian. Beautiful though the language may be, it is not a good choice for engineers when they're building a way in Norway or designing a bridge in Vietnam. For better or worse, the global tongue of engineers is English. Hoping to attract more international students, the Politechnic decided to run its doctor's courses in English only. Over 100 teachers went to court to block the plan, referring to a 1933 law that makes Italian the official language. For some teachers, all that matters is that they don't feel comfortable teaching in English. In 2013, the court said they were right. Teaching English was out.\nBut there was more to come. They then went on a nationwide campaign against their university's decision. Unwisely, the defenders of the Italian language backed them, saying, \"we note with regret and concern the ignorance and abandonment  of Italian in the university education.\"\nThe leaders at the Politechnic refused to be frightened, and asked for the ruling. Last month the Council of State said, \"Art and science are free, and teaching them is free.\" The question is whether teaching in English prevents students acquiring knowledge. But one could put it differently, and ask whether universities should be free to teach in whatever way they think best serves their students.\nInterestingly, the people one might expect to be most against English-only teaching, the students themselves, have taken it easy. The president, Giovanni Azzone, told me: \"Students write to me about everything from the lack of parking spaces to washrooms that don't work. Not one has ever complained about the courses in English.\""

On Friday, he will become the first person in his family, originally from El Salvador, to graduate from college.

For starters, English is his second language.  He also faced stereotypes .  Although Bob never doubted that he would be a college graduate, other people assumed he wouldn't because he didn't come from a family of high income.  There were other obstacles as well, but Bob viewed them all as opportunities.\nBob's mother says she feels very happy and proud that her son is about to graduate with honors, and remembers the sacrifices he's made to get there.  \"He has worked very hard.

      "It was 7:00 am in Kyoto, Japan, and the taxi company had just called a second time to say they couldn't find my house. Once again I spelt out directions even a blind person could follow. I glanced impatiently at my watch, and waited. Only two hours remained until my flight left--and it was an hour and a half trip to the airport.\nOutside, heavy rains were pouring down. My house was so far north in the city that buses pass only here times a day.\nThe telephone rang again. \"Terribly sorry,\" began the man at the taxi company. Then I realized that the taxi company, flooded with calls, could only offer in-city runs. I had heard this happens when the weather gets bad. I shouted into the phone that I had a plane to catch and I would meet the taxi outside my house.\nStanding in the wind-driven rain, I looked up and down the road. No taxi. A car went by, the driver and passenger staring at the crazy foreigner in the downpour.\nFinally a white car appeared and pulled to a stop. A young man threw open the door, waving for me to get in. Shaking with cold and anger, I climbed in.\nIn the most polite Japanese, the man said he was called Mike, with who I had spoken three times that morning. He had left his post in the office and raced here in his personal car. He apologized again, but didn't explain why a taxi would not pick me up. Delivering me straight to the airport, he refused the 2,000 yen I pressed into his hand.\nA few hours later, as the storm-delayed 727 took off, I opened the newspaper.

      "Over the years, Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, has studied such things as how far Americans typically drive to buy food, how many times we refill our plates at all-you-can-eat buffets and how we organize our kitchens. In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less."

      "Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient institution,-which has existed for at least six thousand years.It was always bad and usually foolish, but in the past human race managed to live with it.Modern inventiveness has changed this.Either man will end war, or war will end man.For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the most serious danger, but bacteriological or chemical weapons may, before Iong, offer an even greater threat.If we succeed in ending nuclear weapons, our work will not be done.It will never be done until we have succeeded in ending war.To do  _ , we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not as contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in kiting people, but by agreement with principles of law.It is not easy to, change very old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted.\nThere are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology(,)would prevent war.I believe this to be a big error.All ideologies are based upon dogmatic statements that are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false.Their adherents (,)  believe in them so fanatically\nthat they are willing to go to war in support of them.\nThe movement of world opinion during the past few years has been very largely such as we can welcome.It has become a commonplace that nuclear war must be avoided.Of course very difficult problems remain in the world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago.It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that negotiations should reach agreements even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory.It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between different countries, but between man and the atom bomb."

      "I took the bus to work for many years. No one knew each other; the passengers all sat there sleepily in the morning. The bus was cheerless and silent.\nOne of the passengers was a small gray-haired man who took the bus to the center for senior citizens every morning. No one ever paid very much attention to him.\nOne July morning he said good morning to the driver and smiled. The driver nodded guardedly . The rest of us were silent.\nThe next day, the old man boarded with a big smile and said in a loud voice: \"A very good morning to you all!\" Some of us looked up, amazed, and murmured \"Good Morning\" in reply.\nThe following weeks, our friend was dressed in a nice old suit and tie. His thin hair had been carefully combed. He said good morning to us every day and we gradually began to nod and talk to each other.\nOne morning he even had a bunch of wild flowers in his hand. The driver turned around smiling and asked: \"Have you got yourself a girlfriend, Charlie?\" We never got to know if his name really was \"Charlie\", but he nodded shyly and said yes. The other passengers whistled and clapped at him. Charlie waved the flowers before he sat down on his seat.\nEvery morning after that Charlie always brought flowers. Some passengers also brought flowers for him. The bus became a happy place.\nThen, one morning, as autumn was closing in, Charlie wasn't waiting at his usual stop. When he wasn't there the next day and the day after that, we started wondering if he was sick or--hopefully - on holiday somewhere.\nWhen we came nearer to the center for senior citizens, one of the passengers asked the driver to wait. We all held our breaths when he went to the door.\nThe old gentle man was fine, but one of his close friends had died over the weekend. How silent we were the rest of the way to work.\nThe next Monday Charlie was waiting at the stop, stooping   a bit more, a little bit more gray, and without a tie. Inside the bus was silent.

      "The SAT is one of two major tests for the entrance to American colleges and universities. The other test is called the ACT. More than 2 million students take the SAT yearly, including about 100,000 foreign students. The organization of the SAT will change the entrance test in 2016. The College Board announced that the new SAT will no longer test students on rarely used words. But it will include passages from American historical documents or from writings on freedom and human rights.\nThe College Board says words on the new test will be related to usage. Students will be asked to tell the meaning of words according to the context of the reading passages. Nigerian student Peace Umoru is in her first year at Howard University. She says the rarely used words are the hardest part for international students. The new test will be easier because of the reform.\nEddie West is with the College Board. He says the new test will better predict a student's performance in college. The changes are moving the test in a positive direction. The new SAT pays more attention to skills and abilities that students need to succeed. The addition of material about American historical documents could make the test harder for international students. After all, they live in different countries with different cultures.

      "In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive. Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it.\nAnother very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them."

      "November not only marks the publication of Toni Morrison's eagerly anticipated  eighth novel, Love, but it is also the tenth anniversary of her Nobel Prize for Literature. Morrison is the first black woman to receive a Nobel, and so honored before her in literature are only two black men:Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright, poet and novelist, in 1986; and Derek Walcott, the Caribbean-born poet, in 1992. But Morrison is also the first and only American-born Nobel prizewinner for literature since 1962, the year novelist John Steinbeck received the award.\nLike Song of Solomon, Love is a multigenerational story, revealing the personal and communal Legacy  of an outstanding black family. As Morrison scholars will tell you, Love is the third volume of a literary master's trilogy investigating the many complexities of love. This trilogy began with Beloved(1988), which deals with a black mother's love under slavery and in freedom. Jazzy(1993), the second volume, tells a story of romantic love in 1920s Harlem. This latest novel looks back from the 1970s to the 1940s and 50s.\nThe emotional center of Love is Bill Cosey, the former owner and host of the shabby Cosey's Hotel and Resort in Silk, North Carolina, described in the novel as \"the best and best-known vacation sport for colored folk on the East Coast.\" We get to know Cosey through the memories of five women who survive and love him: his granddaughter, his widow, two former employees, and a homeless young girl.\nThe latest novel, Love, had been described in the promotional material from her publisher as \"Morrison's most accessible work since Song of Solomon.\" This comparison to her third novel, published in 1977, was an effective selling point."

Judges chose more than four hundred of them to attend the finals.\nSUZI LEVINE: \"One from Thailand was called NewKrean, where they created a Windows Phone 7 application that allows you to broadcast your location to your social network of friends so that you can be more easily rescued.\" They named their application Terra.\nSuzi Levine says there were also ideas from Egypt inspired by the revolution that _ president Hosni Mubarak in February.\nSUZI LEVINE: \"One was to use Bluetooth as sort of a Twitter equivalent so that if the government shuts down the Internet, you actually can still have a massive social distribution.\"\nStudents competed in nine categories. For example, in software design the top prize of twenty-five thousand dollars went to Team Hermes from Ireland.

The fishermen blocked their way with a boathook  . It was an ugly, unfriendly and life-threatening struggle before the surfers were forced to return to the beach. It is believed that the dolphins were later taken into a pool and killed.\nPanettiere, who is a brave surfer and loyal animal protector, made up her mind to save the dolphins of Japan and said, \"It was really frightening. Some of us were hit by the boathook, but in the end all we were really worried about the dolphins. It was so sad. We were so close to them and they were jumping out of the water to see us.\" Breaking down in tears, she added, \"One little baby dolphin stuck his head out and looked at me and the thought that it's no longer with us is really hard to take.\"\nThe surfers left the country to avoid arrest   by the Japanese police. Panettiere is now back in Los Angeles.\nMore than 22,000 dolphins are killed by fishermen in Japan every year. Many Japanese believe dolphins should be treated like fish. They have been hunting dolphins for centuries and see any criticism   of this as an attack on their culture."

      "Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal relationships.One strength of the human condition is our tendency to give and receive support from one another under stressful circumstances.Social support consists of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties.Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily difficulties.People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties.Studies over a range of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people protect themselves from illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.\nSocial support _ stress in a number of ways.First, friends, relatives and coworkers may let us know that they value us.Our self respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others despite our faults and difficulties.Second, other people often provide us with informational support.They help us to explain and understand our problems and find solutions to them.Third, we typically find social companionship supportive.Engaging in leisure time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distract(...)us from our worries and troubles.Finally, other people may give us important support--financial aid, material resources, and needed services--that reduces stress by helping us solve and deal with our problems."

      "A jobless man applied for the position of \"office boy\" at Microsoft. The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test.\n\"You are employed,\" he said. \"Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as date when you may start. \"\nThe man replied, \"But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail. \"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the HR manager. \"If you don't have an e-mail, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist cannot have the job. \"\nThe man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do, with only ten dollars in his pocket. He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy 10kg tomatoes. He then sold the tomatoes from door to door. In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, and returned home happily with 60 dollars.\nThe man realized that he can survive in this way, and started to go every day earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubled or _ every day. Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. Five years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US.\nHe started to plan his family's future and decided to have a life insurance. He called an insurance broker and chose a protection plan.\nWhen the conversation was concluded the broker asked him his e-mail. The man replied, \"I don't have an e-mail. \"\nThe broker answered curiously, \"You don't have an e-mail, and yet have succeeded to build an empire.

Want to know more?\n    After you get up,your apartment will be like an electronic orchestra with you as the conductor.With simple moves of your hand and spoken instructions,you'll be able to control your apartment's temperature,humidity,music and lighting.You'll be able to look through the day's news on translucent screens while your breakfast waits for you in the automatic oven.\n    As you move into your kitchen,maybe you will stub your toe on the edge of a cabinet. You'll grab your cell phone and open the diagnostics app.Inside your phone there will be a tiny microchip that uses X-ray waves to scan your body. The scan will reveal that your toe is just slightly hurt,not broken,which will convince you not to see a doctor.\n    After breakfast,your driverless car will take you to work.While you drive,your central computer system will suggest a list of chores your housekeeping robots could see to today and it will also remind you to buy a gift for your mother's upcoming birthday.\n    As you can see,with the help of advanced technologies,our lives will be more efficient. Teehnology will mitigate our forgetfulness and free us of many small burdens that distract us, such as buying a ticket or trying to remember our kids' parent-teacher meeting.Our brain will therefore be able to focus on more important things like preparing for a presentation or doing \"deep thinking\".\n    However,the development of technology might have some disadvantages as well. By 2033,we'll be relying heavily on the virtual world,which will mean that all of our data will be stored in the cloud,a remote digital storage system with near limitless capacity. That will increase the possibility of someone else accessing,sharing or controlling our personal information."

      "Throughout July 1945, the Japanese mainland, from Tokyo on Honshu northward to the coast of Hokkaido, were bombed as if an invasion were about to take place. In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. \nIn 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles."

Here are four of the best Wild West vacation locations available:\nWalk the Lewis and Clark Trail\nWalk some or all of the 3,700 miles trail that was traversed by Mariwether Lewis and William Clark, two of the world's greatest explorers. Though not all the trails are marked, there are various stops that have been preserved by various historic societies. There is also a coach   that makes a 16-day _ following the trail. This begins in St. Louis, Missouri, and ends in Astoria, Oregon.\nVenture Route 66\nTake a tour or go to see it yourself -- ride on the famous Route 66. The road is nearly 2,500 miles long. Harley Davidson offers motorcycle tours that last two weeks. Route 66 will provide an experience that may only be found on the open road. The historic road is still well taken care of.\nVisit the Grand Canyon\nVisit the greatest canyon in the world, located in Northern Arizona. Raft down the Colorado River, or hike the various trails that run throughout the canyon. If walking is not your thing, there are donkey and horse riding adventures available. In addition, there are motorized boats that float down through the canyon in a week's time.\nVisit Deadwood\nLocated in South Dakota, Deadwood is a historic landmark. It is the kind of town that comes to mind when one thinks of an old western film. Actors who act as gunslingers   will often be seen in the streets playing their roles. Winter activities are popular in this old town, and there is always something to do."

And, as you speed along the road, you might also think of ways in which you could improve your bike-- make it safer, more efficient, or more comfortable. In fact, the two-wheeled machines make for some cool science projects.\nThis year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), held last May in Cleveland, featured(had)three bicycle projects from three countries. Like many of the other experiments presented at ISEF, the bike projects showed that some of the most interesting scientific research often begins by taking a closer look at things you care about.\nRenato Angulo Chu had even grander ambitions. The 12th-grader from Lima, Peru, wanted to _ some of his country's economic troubles.\n\"I see a problem in my country,\" Renato said. \"If you go to the forests in Peru, in some places you cannot find electricity. If you go with my bicycle, you can turn on the lights.\"\nRenato, 16, spent 3 years designing his special Multibike. The device looks like a fixed exercise bike. It has wires fixed along the frame and a blender strapped (fastened) to the back. Turning the pedals operates the blender. The same principle can be used to sharpen knives or sweep city streets.\nThe Multibike can work either as a fixed bike or as a bicycle able to travel city streets and country roads. It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine.\n\"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said. More importantly, he added, the same concept could be used to bring light to houses in remote regions of the rainforest."

      "When 15-year-old Louisa Ball takes a nap, she sleeps for days on end, and no amount of shaking can fully wake her up. The British girl has a rare condition called Sleeping Beauty Sickness. Doctors don't know what causes it or how to cure it --only know that it strikes teenagers and goes away by itself after eight to 12 years.\nLouisa's mum, Lottie, told NBC News that the girl had flulike symptoms just over a year ago. Shortly afterward, she had her first period of long sleeping.\nShe was eventually diagnosed with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, whose victims worldwide may number no more than 1,000. The victims live normally for weeks or months at a time, with normal sleep patterns and normal energy levels. Then, with little warning, they'll go to sleep for days or weeks at a time. So far, Louisa's longest period in bed has been 13 days. Victims will wake briefly, but be _ and not fully awake. Louisa's parents force her awake so she can use the bathroom and eat.\nNow, Louisa's friends can tell when a period is coming on. She stops talking and she may be annoyed easily. That's when she knows she has to get home to her bed. Louisa has slept through family vacations, the dance recitals  she loves to perform in, and school tests. Now it becomes increasingly difficult to catch up on missed schoolwork.\nBut just as doctors don't know the cause, they also don't know why it ends as mysteriously as it began. The illness is unrelated to narcolepsy , whose victims are constantly tired and drop off for brief periods of sleep at any time.\nIt's so dramatic that some people have accused Louisa of making the false symptoms to get attention. Her father, Richard, thinks that's absurd."

      "In the United States, the legal age to drink alcohol is twenty-one --- one of the highest in the world. Americans debate whether _ should be lowered, or whether young drinkers would only drink more. In parts of Europe, the legal drinking age for beer, and sometimes hard liquor, is sixteen. Yet France may raise the age limit for beer and wine sales to eighteen, the same as for hard liquor there.\n    Rules on alcohol differ from college to college in the United States. Many schools require all first-year students to take an alcohol prevention and education program, often given online. Some have a \"zero tolerance\" policy where alcohol is banned from all buildings. Parents are informed of violations  and students may be suspended . \n     At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, permission is needed to serve alcohol at any event on campus. But alcohol is banned in first-year dorms --- where most students are under twenty-one anyway. \n     Susan Davis, a university lawyer, says campus police and local police report underage drinking violations to administrators. The university judicial committee decides punishment on a case by case basis. For example, the committee might suspend or expel a student. It might require an alcohol education program. Or it might just give a warning.\n     Jon Zug is a prosecutor  in Albemarle County, where the university is located. He says international students would face the same punishment as American citizens for underage drinking in Virginia. That includes a fine of five hundred dollars or fifty hours of community service. But first offenders might be given a chance to complete an alcohol education program instead.\n    Schools have to report legal violations by international students to the Department of Homeland Security. International adviser Richard Tanson at the University of Virginia says even minor violations stay on a student's permanent immigration record. He says international students should know that this can affect them in the future if they try to re-enter the United States."

I didn't really understand the meaning of the word \"hero\" until my third year in the college.\nIf you saw her, you wouldn't think she really looks the part, but she is stronger than Superman could ever be. Her name is Sandra Keierleber. I first met her at volleyball tryouts , but didn't notice anything special at first. As the week passed, however, she showed she had more heart than anyone. She stood out because she never gave up, no matter what.\nSandra isn't the tallest or the fastest --- in fact, this was her first time playing volleyball and it showed--- but that didn't stop her. She was always the first to arrive and the last to leave. By the end of tryouts she had found a place in everyone's heart. When the name list for new members was put up, we all waited nervously as she checked. When she stood at the door and smiled happily, all we could do was cheer.\nAfter Sandra made the team, she worked even harder to improve her game. When she asked for help, we gladly taught her. She also became our fan, attending almost every school game and even joining us in the city games. We all like her, because she never thinks about doing things the easy way, or loses that smile.

But scientists and archeologists now agree that women invented one very important thing. It had changed the history. They invented agriculture.\n    Before the invention of agriculture men were hunter. They went out every day. Sometimes they killed animals-sometimes animals killed them. Life was difficult and dangerous. Women had to go out every day, too. They collected roots, fruit and grass. Then, one day, more than 10,000years ago a woman dropped some grass seeds. She dropped them near her home in the Middle East. They grew--and the first wheat was born. The idea grew, too. Women planted roots and fruit trees. Then they could stay at home and look after the children and the animals. Women liked baby animals: dogs, cows, sheep and goats. That idea grew, too. Then their husbands did not have to go hunting for meat. They stayed at home. They built villages and cities. Men began civilization---after women invented agriculture."

      "Street art can be found on buildings, sidewalks, street signs and even trash cans from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a global visual culture. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the work of street artists.\nIt is not easy to provide an exact history of the street art movement. This kind of art has developed in many kinds of ways in places all over the world. Also, because it is illegal to paint public and private property without permission, street artists usually work secretly. This secretive nature of street art and its countless forms make it hard to define exactly. And people have different opinions about the movement. Some think street art is a crime and destroys property. But others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression.  Many experts say the movement began in New York City in the nineteen sixties. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their TAG on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to identify themselves and their artwork. This colorful style of writing is also called graffiti. It is visually exciting and energetic.\nGraffiti also became a separate movement expressing the street culture of young people living in big cities. Graffiti art represented social and political rebellion. These artists could travel around areas of the city making creative paintings for everyone to see. Sometimes this street art created a dispute between artists and city officials. Graffiti artists created their images and city officials quickly painted over them. During the 1980s, two famous New York painters--Keith Haring and Jean Michel began showing their work in art galleries and museums. This is when street art started to become part of the more general popular culture."

      "Davey wanted to play baseball. But fifty years ago, in his small town, he couldn't find enough players for two full teams or an empty lot big enough for a field. And when he played ball in his back yard, he just broke windows and got into trouble. So Davey began playing with a plastic golf ball and a broom handle for a bat.\nWhen his dad, David Mullaney, a former semi-pro baseball pitcher , realized his son was hurting his arm trying to throw curves with the little plastic ball, he decided to find a better solution. Mullaney got a bunch of hollow plastic _ from a local factory, sat down at his kitchen table and began cutting different size holes in the balls with a razor knife. He thought maybe the holes would alter the ball's flight and help his son throw curves and sliders without hurting his arm.\nAll the balls failed--except the one with the eight oblong  holes cut into one of the hemispheres. This ball curved naturally and sharply without a violent snap of the wrist. In fact, Davey was now striking out so many batters; he called his new ball a \"wiffle ball\". A year later, Mullaney borrowed $20,000 from family and friends and started producing Wiffle Balls in his little suburban town of Shelton, Connecticut.\n\"I didn't want investors.\" He said, \"I wanted to control my own company.\" This was the beginning of one of the hottest fads  of the fifties and a perennial  best seller well known all around the world. Since then millions of boys and girls have enjoyed countless hours of safe, wholesome fun playing with a Wiffle ball and bat. Esquire Magazine has even called the Wiffle Ball \"a national treasure\". By producing a high quality product at an affordable price, three generations of Mullany's have enjoyed the satisfaction and benefits of running a successful and profitable family business.\nOver the years, they've had plenty of offers to buy them out, but they're still working out of a small factory in Shelton, making a new Wiffle Ball every couple of seconds. Creativity and persistence are two of the important sources for wealth. If he gave up his attempts at trying new things, Mullany would not have invented the wiffle ball, nor would he have made such a big fortune."

Four students from Shanghai were killed and several were injured. There were several reasons for the accident, but if the students had worn life jackets, it would have made a big difference.\nTherefore, it is important to take steps to avoid accidents before going on trips whether on land or water. Here are some steps:\nMake sure you are physically fit for any activities. You need energy for hiking or boating after a long inactive winter.\nResearch your route  . Check the weather report so you can pack the correct things so that an unexpected downpour or high winds won't destroy your day.\nIf you are visiting a different culture, learn some basic knowledge about what's accepted and what is not.\nTake plenty of water to prevent your body from losing too much water and be sure to wear the correct footwear to protect your feet. Don't go to faraway areas and never risk going into unknown waters.\nGoing in a group is safer than going alone. If you have to travel by yourself, leave a note of your travel route, telephone number and how you are traveling. So if there's an emergency, people can get in touch with you."

      "As the new semester begins, millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper or, more likely, how best to delay that paper.\nProcrastination is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it. They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space, eating snacks, surfing the Internet, watching videos and looking at other students sitting around them, who, most likely, are doing nothing either.\nParalyzed   by their habit to procrastinate, they write micro blogs about their fears, asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue. But this does nothing to break the spell  .\nAccording to a recent report, 95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are always procrastinating. The figures are disappointing. Procrastinators are less wealthy, less healthy and less happy than those who don't delay. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior, but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong.\nMany procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure. Pelling says this is nonsense, as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. The behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel ashamed, inconveniences others and annoys loved ones.\nPelling also points out that procrastination feels particularly delinquent  in a society that thinks of speedy action as admirable, and, at times, even as a moral good.\nFortunately, social scientists have thrown their weight behind efforts to understand this behavioral mistake and offer strategies to control it. Piers Steel, a Canadian social scientist and author of The Procrastination Equation, believes human is \"designed\" to procrastinate. Nevertheless, he suggests a couple of good ways to get through the task at hand."

      "One warm September night, Mira had come down to the beach to enjoy the night air. She closed her eyes and listened to the waves. Suddenly, she could hear another sound, so she opened her eyes and looked down at the sand. It was moving! All of a sudden she could see a tiny head coming out. Then a turtle  appeared! One by one they struggled out of their underground nests. Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles.\nMira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away, so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . Suddenly, she remembered something her grandmother had told her.\n\"Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September. Those baby turtles hatch  and head back down to the sea. But some of them never make it. Sometimes they die going across the dunes, trying to find those bright lights on the houses. Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes. That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles.\"\nMira looked out across the dunes at her house. Mira saw her mother and father, sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch.\nMira began to run to her house and shouted, \"The turtles are hatching! We have to help the turtles!\" With these words, Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights.\nIn a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her. They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves. Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water. As the turtle swam away, it looked back at Mira. In the moonlight, Mira thought she saw it smile."

      "Without any previous notice, a documentary dominated headlines and social websites over the weekend. Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28. It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference.\nChai, 39, said she started the work out of her \"personal clashes\" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter. \"I sealed tight all the windows. I started every day by checking the air pollution index,\" Chai said. Millions of other people are also doing the same. While they stop there, Chai goes deeper. \"I don't want to live in this way. 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on.\"\nOver a year, she investigated polluted sites to find the sources of smog, visited the US and the UK to learn about their anti-pollution experiences, and interviewed officials, scientists and the general public. Chai's research reveals that the burning of coal and oil contributes to 60 percent of PM2.5 pollutants. She thus questions the country's energy consumption habits in the film.\nShe then goes on to disclose loopholes   in car emissions regulations. The film also explains that businesses are pressured not to abide by  the laws because violating  them carries little or no cost, while making changes bumps up costs. The film also points at China's petroleum and steel industries as the biggest sources of air pollution.\nCheng Chen, a 22-year-old student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, found the documentary \"very inspiring\". \"I used to think it's not my duty to deal with air pollution--I don't own a factory or a car,\" said Cheng. \"But Chai told me we share the same fate since we breathe the same air and there is a lot I can do.\"\nHowever, some people are annoyed by the film's description of their polluted hometowns, especially when it shows a banner from Xingtai in Hebei saying \"Congratulations to our city for no longer being ranked the last place among the country's 74 cities in terms of air quality\".\n _ \"What's important is that Chai's work has raised public attention toward the structure of the energy industry,\" she said.   Meanwhile, experts remind moved viewers of the film's limitations."

      "Though I have traveled in hundreds of trains, few unusual things have ever happened to me. But one day in a train something did happen. I do not mean that I was hurt: no one was hurt.\nI do my work in a hot country far away from England. Every September I go there to do my business, and every July I come back to England to have a rest. So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova, and at Mendova I catch my ship.\nThere is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova, and it suits me well. It goes as far as Endoran, but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in. It is called The Flying Bluebird. It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning, and it is never late.\nA ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven, and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well. I always travel by it, and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship. That is more than enough time.\nWell, one September night, I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual. The train leaves Paris at nine o'clock every night, and I was in my place soon after half past eight. There were three or four people there with me, but very soon a lot of others got into the train. When no more people could sit down, they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor . In a short time the corridor was full too, and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train.\nI could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows, but they could not get in, and the train left Paris without them. The man sitting next to me started to ask all kinds of questions: \"Where do you work? How long does it take you to get there? Are you married? How many children do you have? How much money do they pay you every year? How much do you have in the bank? How much do you spend every month?\"\nHe asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers, and at last he stopped and began to read the paper.\nI usually sleep quite well in the train, but this time I slept only a little. There were too many people, and there were too many things: small bags, large bags, coats, hats, boxes, newspapers and food. As usual, we got angry about the window. Most people wanted it shut, and two of us wanted it open. But that always happens. It was shut all night, as usual.\nWhen I awoke in the early morning I felt hot and dirty, and glad that the journey was reaching its end. At seven minutes past nine The Flying Bluebird stopped. We were at Mendova, and I stood up thankfully. I took my two suitcases, held one in each hand, and tried to move towards the door into the corridor. In order to get out of the train, I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end. There was no other way out.\nI could not even into the corridor. There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet, and three men were standing in my way. I felt a touch of fear. I had to get out, you see; I had to catch my ship, which left at half past eleven. And the train did not stop again until it reached Endoran, two hundred miles away.\n\"I must get out!\" I cried. Everyone there understood me, but no one could move.\nAt last I was able to put one foot over the suitcase on the floor, and I nearly reached the door into the corridor. But then, very slowly, the train began to move. It was taking me away!\n\"Stop!\" I cried. \"I want to get out!\" But no one outside the train could hear me, and the people inside did not care much. The train moved a little faster. What could I do? I was not even in the corridor.\nFear made me think quickly. In front of my eyes, just, above the door, was a notice that told everyone how to stop the train. I had to pull an iron thing near the notice. I did not waste time. I pulled it.\nWell, _ That was to show everyone that there was something wrong. It was not a small sound. Possibly the men in my ship two miles away could hear it. Then the train stopped.\nNo one likes to stop a train if there is no need. But I had to catch my ship. That was the only thought in my mind: to get out and catch my ship."

      "Aqeela Asifi, who fled to Pakistan as a young woman, has spent her life teaching other Afghan refugees.\nFor her efforts, Ms. Asifi, who is 49, has won the 2015 UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award. She also gets $100,000 to help pay for her education projects. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award honors extraordinary service to people who have been forced from their homes. Eleanor Roosevelt, Graca Machel and Luciano Pavarotti are some of the other winners of the award.\nAsifi faced many problems in Afghanistan before she fled to Pakistan. Resources were limited and education for women was discouraged. However, in Pakistan, the 49-year-old was able to bring change to her conservative Afghan community. She persuaded parents to send their daughters to school in a tent at the Kot Chandana refugee village. The village was in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.\nSince then, Ms. Asifi has guided more than a thousand refugee girls through their primary education. \"When I began my mission to educate Afghan girls, I could not have imagined that one day it will win me this award. I cannot express my happiness,\" she told VOA.\nMs. Asifi was a teacher in Kabul when she fled with her family in 1992. \"In Afghanistan I was teaching both boys and girls,\" she told VOA. \"When I left Afghanistan and ended up in this refugee village with my family, I was saddened to find out there were no facilities here, particularly for women and girls.\" They made their home in the distant refugee community in Kot Chandana. There she began teaching a small number of students in her tent. She made teaching materials by hand.\nHer tent school has led to the opening of several permanent schools in the village. These schools teach more than one thousand children. Support from the UNHCR, local government, and non-governmental organizations helped make these new schools possible.\nMs. Asifi is a mother of six children. She has worked hard to pay for their education. She spends almost all her income to pay her son's tuition to study engineering at Kabul University.\nBut seeking higher education for her four daughters is difficult. There is not enough money or secondary schools for girls in the village.\nThe Afghan teacher hopes more and more children will receive an education in Afghanistan. She hopes her home country becomes better known for higher levels of education, instead of war. \"I want my goal to be introduced in parts of Afghanistan where conservative traditions and customs still prevent parents from sending their daughters to outdoor schools,\" she said."

      "Life is too short to waste a moment, so while you still have time, let your hair down, remove that \"boring\" tag in your so-called life and start making it worthwhile. Below are some tips that will help you live a wonderful life.\n1. Keep a Positive Attitude. Enjoy what you have and work on getting the things you desire. Psychologists believe that optimism   is a good defense against unhappiness, so it is better to keep your optimism alive. Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder, so be happy.\n2. Don't Be Afraid to Take Risks. Life is all about taking risks, and that's the exciting part of it. Challenges and failure are part of life. Once you learn how to take risks, you'll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by.\n3. You only have one life, so make it worthwhile. Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present.\n4. List the Things You Want to Do. Stop lazing around and give yourself something to be busy with. Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline, not to stress you out, but to remind you of your goals. So don't put limits to yourself because you'll never know what may happen.\n5. Try Out Something New. Getting into something or trying something unfamiliar to you may seem scary, but nothing can make you feel happier than being able to overcome your fear. Who knows? You might enjoy it! The world is a big place and there are still lots of things waiting to be explored by you. Go to a foreign place where you know no one."

      "Once upon a time a peacock  and a tortoise became great friends. The peacock lived in a tree on the bank of the stream in which the tortoise had his home, and every day the peacock danced near the stream and displayed his gay plumage for the amusement of his friend. \nUnfortunately, one day a bird-catcher caught the peacock and was about to take him away to the market. The unhappy bird begged his captor to allow him to say goodbyeto his friend -- the tortoise. The bird-catcher agreed and took the peacock to the tortoise, who was greatly astonished when he saw his friend become a captive. The tortoise asked the bird-catcher to let the peacock go, but the bird-catcher laughed at his request, saying that was his livelihood. The tortoise then said, \"If I give you a handsome present, will you let my friend go?\" \"Certainly,\" answered the bird-catcher. So the tortoise dived into the water and in a few seconds came up with a handsome pearl. To the bird-catcher's astonishment, the tortoise handed it to him. This was beyond his expectation, and he let the peacock go immediately.\nA short time later, the  _ man came back and told the tortoise that he thought he had not been paid enough for the release of his friend, and threatened that unless he received another pearl which matched the first one, he would again catch the peacock. The tortoise, who had already advised his friend to go to a distant place on being set free, was greatly enraged at the greed of this man. \"Well,\" said the tortoise, \"if you insist on having another pearl like that one, give it to me and I will fish you out an exact match for it.\" The cupidity of the bird-catcher prevented his reasoning that \"one in the hand is equal to two in the bed of the stream\", and he quickly gave the pearl to the wily tortoise, who swam out with it, saying, \"I am no fool to take one and give two!\" and disappeared immediately, leaving the bird-catcher to be sorry for his greed."

      "Until last spring, Nia Parker and the other kids in her neighborhood went to school on Bus 59.But as fuel prices rose, the school district needed to find a way to cut its transportation costs.So the school's busing company redrew its route map, canceling Nia's bus.Now Nia and her neighbors travel the half mile to school via a \"walking school bus\"--a group of kids, supervised   by an adult or two, who make the walk together.\nMany parents are delighted to see their kids walking to school, partly because many did so themselves.According to a 1979 survey, nearly half of school kids walked or biked to school, compared with only 16 percent in 2011.Modern parents have been unwilling to let kids walk to school for fear of traffic, crime or simple bullying, but with organized adult supervision, those concerns have reduced.\nSchools and busing companies are finding other ways to save.In rural areas where busing is a must, some schools have even chosen four-day school weeks.Busing companies instruct drivers to cancel extra stops from routes and to turn off the engine while idling .They are also using computer software to determine the most fuel-efficient routes, which aren't always the shortest ones.\nThere could be disadvantages, however, to the busing cutbacks .If every formerly bused student begins walking to school, it's an environmental win--but if too many of their parents decide to drive them instead, the carbon footprint can grow.Replacing buses with many more parent-driven cars can also increase safety risks.A 2011 report concluded students are 13 times safer on a school bus than in a passenger car, since buses have fewer accidents and with stand them better due to their size.And some students complain about the long morning hikes, particularly when the route contains a really big hill."

      "Downing the last drop of an expensive famous brand H2O as well as remembering to throw the empty bottle in the recycling bin, makes you feel pretty good about yourself,  _ Even  when the bottles are recycles, there are all kinds of other consequences of swallowing bottled water, says Melissa Peffers, the air-quality program manager for Environmental Defense.\nThe containers are often filled in faraway lands, then shipped from abroad, and stored in refrigerators at your local store. Compare that with the influence on environment of turning on your tap, filling a glass, and drinking up!\nAnyone who is choosing bottled water for health reasons is misguided, says Peffers, \"Most bottled water is just tap water.\" And what comes out of your tap is carefully monitored to follow the strict rules. Consider another fact that bottled water is surprisingly expensive, especially when compared with the alternative, which is almost free, and it is astonishing that prefix = st1 /America's desire for bottled water seems impossible to satisfy, reaching nearly 30 billion bottles a year.\n\"My parents' generation never had bottled water, \" says Isabelle Silvrman, an Environmental Defense legal adviser. She has made a commitment to  _ . \"You don't need to fetch it home from the store, and it's cheaper.\" She adds.\nBottled water's role as a status symbol needs to change, Peffers points out. So when a waiter at an expensive restaurant offers \"And what's your drink?\" that's no reason to forger your conviction . \"Don't be afraid to say, 'I'll have tap.' Say it loud enough that the other tables nearby can hear you,\" Peffers says, \"And then spend that money on a dessert.\""

For the main trend (, ) in the world's climate in the coming years will, scientists say, be a predictable result of man's activities.\nAt the start of the industrial revolution nearly two centuries ago, man set off a big experiment in planetary engineering. Unaware of what he was doing, he spared no thought for the consequences  .Today the possible outcome is alarmingly clear, but the experiment is unstoppable. Within the lifetimes of many of us, the Earth may become warmer than it has been for a thousand years. By the middle of this century it may be warmer than it has been since before the last Ice Age.\nA warmer climate may seem welcome, but  _ could bring many dangers, damages to crops in the world's main food-producing areas, famine  , economic instability  , civil unrest and even war.\nIn the much longer term, melting of the great ice-caps of Greenland and Antarctica could raise sea-levels throughout the world. The average sea-level has already risen a foot since the turn of the last century, and if the ice-caps disappear completely, it would rise by nearly 200 feet. Complete melting might take many centuries, but even a small increase in sea-level would threaten low-lying parts of the world such as the Netherlands."

If the present rate of smoking continues, the number of deaths each year from smoking could rise to 10 million by the year 2020. \nThe study describes smoking is the biggest cause of deadly diseases among grown-ups in industrial countries. So far most of the smoking deaths have happened to men, especially in developing countries. \nA researcher at the World Health Organization says 70% of Chinese men smoke more than 15 cigarettes each day. In Latin America about 50% of the men are smokers. There also are a very large number of smokers in Russia and in Eastern Europe. And 25% of all smoking deaths worldwide are in those areas of the world. Scientists say smoking will kill 50% of the smokers. \nSmoking is known to cause lung cancer. It also can lead to cancer of the mouth and other parts of bodies. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to suffer from heart disease. \nExperts say that people reduce their chance of dying from smoking if they stop smoking completely.

      "A new study warns that about thirty percent of the world's people may not have enough water by the year 2025.\nAn American organization called Population Action International did the new study. It was more than three hundred and thirty-five million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or in the Middle East.\nPopulation Action International researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three thousand million people lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have serious water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on the earth the same. Mr Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing in these countries will continue to increase.\nThe report says lack of water in the future may result several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking water is not safe. Mr Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases such as cholera that are carried in water.\nLack of water also may result in more international conflict. Countries may have to fight for water in the future. Some countries, such as Syria, Sudan, Cambodia, and so on, now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability to improve their economies. This is because industries often need a large amount of water.\nThe Population Action International study gives several ways to solve the water problem. One way is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third is to use less water for agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth."

      "With more and more wineries   offering organic varieties to lower their eco-footprint  , it's no surprise that they're looking at the environmental impacts of their packaging as well. The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks   uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution.\nBeyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect. Trucking all the heavy glass bottles causes a much larger carbon footprint than the transportation of much lighter boxed wine. Almost half the weight of an ordinary case of wine comes from the bottles; about 95 percent of the weight of a case of boxed wine is the wine itself.\n\"A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and causes about 5.2 pounds of carbon dioxide when it travels from a farm in California to a store in New York,\" reports Colman, a researcher. \"A 3-liter box causes about half the carbon dioxide per 750 milliliters.\"\nAccording to the Wine Group, the third largest wine company in the world and a big advocate for switching away from glass bottles, there are other advantages to boxed wine (which typically includes a plastic bag within a cardboard box). The vacuum   packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured.\nStill, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps   are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar   full of cardboard boxes,\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands. But that could all change as more and more wine makers and drinkers take responsibility for saving the Earth."

      "Yang Qunhui, 28, a graduate of Chengdu University of Information Technology, Sichuan Province, gave up her job with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan ($3,014) at a famous company, but has started her own restroom-ad business with five other graduates, becoming a \"restroom queen.\"\nThe company, opened in May, is now the only one of its kind in Chengdu.\nIt has two goals: to find suitable restrooms to place ads and to find clients  who are willing to put their ads in them.\n\"We are now trying to find restrooms to place the ads. A larger area means more ad sources,\" said Yang.\nYang got the idea to run the company one year ago when she looked for toilet repairing information on the Internet but finally noticed companies in Beijing and Shanghai doing restroom ads.\n\"It's so interesting,\" she said. \"Everyone has their dream. Mine is to start my own business and do something I like.\"\nAfter some research, Yang found the advantages of restroom ads. They are low-cost, making it easier to find clients. \"Most private companies are middle or small-sized ones. Cheap ads are an good choice.\"\nAnother advantage, she said, is that people tend to remember words and messages they've seen while sitting or standing in the loo.\nYang said sitting on a toilet, one usually feels bored and even an old newspaper helps kill the time. \n\"Most people think an ad is effective as long as it is read, however, the ad works only when it is remembered by readers,\" she said."

Johnson was very tired and went straight to bed. He slept well and didn't wake up until nine o'clock the next morning.\nJohnson went downstairs for breakfast. Because there were no other guests, Mrs. Smith invited him to have breakfast with her family. Her only daughter, Catherine, about 13, was already sitting in the dining-room. Mrs. Smith went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Johnson noticed there were four places at the table and asked Catherine if there was another guest. Catherine told him that it was an empty place. And it used to be her father's place. Her father had been a fisherman. Three years before he had gone out in his boat, and had never returned. Her mother always kept that place for him and made his breakfast every morning. Catherine showed him his photo on the wall. Johnson said nothing, but looked very puzzled  . At that moment Mrs. Smith returned. She served four cups of tea, and put one in the empty place. Looking at the empty chair, Johnson was more puzzled.\nSuddenly, Johnson heard footsteps outside the door and a tall man with a black beard walked into the room. Johnson looked scared. It was the man in the photo. He jumped up and ran out of the room. The man asked, \"What's the matter?\" Catherine said, \"I don't know. He's a guest from London.

      "September is an exciting month in every college freshman's life. For many, it's the first time that they've left home to live in a new environment. But after the hustle and bustle of a few weeks, excitement gives way to a less enjoyable emotion-- homesickness.\nHomesickness manifests itself in many ways. You may miss mum's cooking, your pets, or even your old bed. All this becomes a fond memory of the past. Homesickness can be a bitter feeling for many students, especially when faced with the challenges of settling into an unfamiliar environment.\nBut remember, you're not alone. According to a recent BBC article, 70 percent of British college students experience homesickness. In this increasingly globalized world in which people migrate to faraway places for a relationship, education or work, homesickness is a feeling shared by many adults.\nHomesickness can have similar symptoms to depression and in extreme cases it can develop into a panic attack. As for the term, homesickness or nostalgia wasn't invented until the 17th century. It was considered a disorder by a Swiss physician, who attributed soldiers' mental and physical discomfort to their longing to return home, \"nostos\" from Greek, and the accompanying pain, \"algos\".\nStudies in recent years, however, have shown that nostalgia may have some benefits to our mental health. After a decade of surveys and researches, Constantine Sedikides, a US social psychologist, found that nostalgia is what makes us human. He explains that nostalgia can resist loneliness, boredom and anxiety. Therefore, it's necessary for college students to learn some ways to overcome the uncomfortable feeling."

A recent study _ this advice -- it shows that frequent active exercise throughout the day can have great health benefits.\nThe study, published in the magazinePreventive Medicine, found that just 2 minutes of stair-climbing several times a day can lower total cholesterol , raise HDL (\"good\") cholesterol and improve the heartbeat in young women who do not have much activity during the day.\"such improvements may have important effects on the health of women, since, like cigarette smoking, poor fitness have been shown to be a high risk for heart disease and death in women,\"said Dr.Colin Boreham with the University of Ulster in Belfast, Ireland and the fellow researchers of this study group. Furthermore, improvements in total cholesterol levels achieved in the study could cut the rate of heart disease in women by a third, they noted.\nThe team of researchers from Britain studied 12 women between 18-22 years old, before and after the exercise program. The women used a public staircase for about 2 minutes a day for 5 days a week. Compared with a group of 10 women who did not take part in the stair-climbing program, the women who climbed stairs showed marked improvements in health and fitness levels after 7 weeks. However, they did not show any signs of weight loss.\"A short-term stair-climbing program can give great health benefits to young women. Stair-climbing may be a particularly suitable way of combining exercise with an individual's daily lifestyle,\"they pointed out.\nExperts advise visiting your doctor before beginning a new exercise program."

There was a family--a man, his wife and an old lady, waiting to cross with me.\nThen, the light turned green and all of us walked quickly across the road. The light lasted very short, and changed into red in no time. I noticed that both the man and his wife had crossed along with me and the old lady was left behind. I quickly realized what happened.\nWhen the light turned dreen again, I ran over to the other side, offered the old lady my right hand and we quickly walked together to the other side of the road.

In the meantime, both the man and his wife realized that they had left the old woman behind and they ran back.. The old lady was in tears and told me, \"Young man, you are more caring   than my son,\" and then gave me a warm handshake  . The man and woman were sorry about what happened and also thanked me.

      "One of the traditions which is now a necessary part of Christmas is a that of Father Christmas, or Santa Claus. According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint  by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions.\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night! Some children can become very worried about this idea and fear that he is a kind of burglar.\nMost children, however, understand from their parents and from the media that Father Christmas is basically a _ character, and look forward to his annual visit with joy and excitement."

      "\"Show them the money!\" That's what some people are saying for college athletes. They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries.\nTop athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. \"Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,\" he explains. \"Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?\"\nThe students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons.\nCollege athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school.\nThe money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. \"Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,\" Massett explains.\nIn addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. \"Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,\" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school."

      "\"Mommy, I'm a funny bird,\" Jack, my almost-4-year-old tells me. He moves his little fingers like wings.\n\"You are?\" I say. I'm sitting across from him while he eats breakfast at our table. I smile; he says the greatest things. A week ago, however, when he had chocolate on his face and I licked   my finger to wipe it off, he said, \"Don't put your dirty water on me.\"\nA week ago, I wouldn't have been sitting here with him during breakfast. I wouldn't have been up, emptying the dishwasher, cleaning the kitchen, or answering emails. We always had dinner together at the table, but other meals got much less attention. I work from home, and my husband owns an advertising agency and often travels. We were so busy that we had to do the chores during breakfast or lunch.\nWhy was I not sitting down with my son? It could take Jack an hour to eat a meal, during which I could feel the tug   of unanswered emails, a deadline, and the unswept floor each minute.\nThen we went to visit friends for a weekend. They have two kids. They are busy, professional, and good parents. And at every meal -- not just dinner -- we all sat down at the table and ate. When we got home, my husband said, \"Maybe we should be doing that.\"\nI took this as criticism. My husband works a lot, so mealtimes are mostly under my charge. The \"we\" he was talking about was me.\nThen, I remembered myself that I'm a big girl, and took his comment the way it was meant. We both want what's best for Jack. Yes, I thought. I'm home. I have to eat, too. My husband is Jack's favorite, which delights and moves me, but I am Jack's constant. Constants are there. Constants sit down.\nSo I've been sitting. And, surprise, I haven't missed a deadline. The house has been clean. And Jack seems to like having me there. Two days ago, over lunch, he smiled and stared at me.\n\"What?\" I asked, amused.\n\"Mommy, I love you so much and I can't stop loving you.\"\nI could have missed that.\nGod, I could have missed _ ."

      "Tayka Hotel De Sal\nWhere: Tahua, Bolivia\nHow much: About $95 a night\nWhy it's cool: You've stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt -- including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses   and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake that's the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When rain starts to dissolve the hotel, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks.\nGreen Magic Nature Resort\nWhere: Vythiri, India\nHow much: About $240 a night\nWhy it's cool: Riding a pulley -operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window -- there is no glass! -- you watch monkeys and birds in the rain forest canopy. Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don't even have to come down for breakfast -- the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn \"elevator\".\nDog Bark Park Inn B&B \nWhere: Cottonwood, Idaho\nHow much: $92 a night\nWhy it's cool: This doghouse isn't just for the family pet. Sweet Willy is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps to the loft in Willy's head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant outside.\nGamirasu Cave Hotel\nWhere: Ayvali, Turkey\nHow much: Between $130 and $475 a night.\nWhy it's cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool, about 65degFin summer. (Don't worry -- there is heat in winter.)"

Big  Brothers  and  Big  Sisters  are  not  replacement  parents  or  social  workers.

They  enjoy  simple  activities  such  as  a  picnic  at  a  park,  cooking,  playing  sport  or  going  to  a  football  match.

      "When looking for love, people may go to some extreme lengths. They might go on blind dates set up by family and friends. They might write personal ad to place in newspapers. Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor andWho Wants to Marry Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants  will find true love.\nOf all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, thirty-five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity   originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode , he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible , and say goodbye to them.\nAt one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it working, \"He wasn't my cup of tea.\" In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. \"You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you,\" she said in tears.\nBut in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. \"I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone,\" she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host!\nAfter leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships--an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo. agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, \"In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing\"\nThe happy couple finally got married at Jonsson's home in Sweden on the island of Varmdo. They wanted to keep the ceremony small, so only forty people were invited, including family and friends. There was some gossip at the time that Jonsson's friends who did not receive invitations to the wedding felt upset. But the bride and groom did not let that ruin their wedding day.\nHas Ulrika Jonsson finally found Mr. Right? Only time will tell. But none of the guests at the wedding could deny the happiness in the couple's eyes as the bride and groom left the wedding ceremony with the music of Stevie Wonder playing in the background, \"Seen a lot of things in this old world. When I touched them, they did nothing, girl. Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.\""

      "My challenge for you is this: to read a book for 15 minutes every single day for a month.\nLet me explain a bit, by telling you where the challenge came from. I have many things in common with my dad, like music taste and sense of humor, but sadly reading isn't one of them. I can happily spend a whole day with a book, but my dad can't read a book for longer than about 5 minutes. He reads emails, websites and papers for work, but not books. He's busy so I think sitting down to read for just 15 minutes a day is a good way to relax and to introduce him to reading.\nMy dad is by no means the only person who avoids books. I know lots of people would rather relax on their computers or in front of the TV. Everyone is different and has their own interests, but I think there're lots of benefits to reading, which screen-based activities don't have.\nFirstly, it's better for your eyes. Looking at screens can be very stressful for you eye muscles, and clearly you should avoid looking at screens for an hour before bed, to get a good night's sleep.\nOne thing I personally love reading, is being transported to another world--I would often forget the time or things around me! Reading is a great way to switch off before you go to bed, because you think more about the world of the book, rather than the real world, so you can truly relax. I know you can be transported to a different world in a film or a TV show, but I think books do _ better.\nI also enjoy hearing what people are doing and finding out what they think. Reading gives me the chance to get to know hundreds of new people! It also teaches you to see things from other people's point of view, and understand other people's decisions or opinions. With a book, you can hear everything a character is thinking or feeling--you really can be inside someone else's head!\nSo give it a go! Take 15 minutes when you're waking up, going to bed, eating too much, or having a coffee. If you read a lot, why not try 15 minutes of an English book, or pass the challenge on to someone else? Good luck, and happy reading!"

      "Dr. Paul Kelly, head of Monkeseaton Community High School in North Tyneside, said it would mean the end of sleeping in lessons before lunch, after experiments showed teenagers could have different body clocks from adults and younger children.\nRussell Foster, an Oxford professor of neuroscience  , tested the memory of 200 Monkseaton pupils at 9 am and 2 pm using pairs of words, and discovered a 9% improvement in the afternoon. Students correctly identified 51% of word pairs in the latest session, compared with 42% in the morning. Tayler McCullough, 15, one of the test subjects, said the majority of students would welcome the extra hours in bed, \"I'm extremely hard to get up in the morning. One or two people like to get to school early, but most of us would be up for going in later. I'm sure it would make a big difference to our learning ability.\"\nKelly is  _ that a change of school timetable will have a meaningful effect on exam performance. He wants his school's governors to approve his plan and put the new time-table in place before the opening of Monkseaton's new timetable in place before the opening of Monkseaton's new school building, the most technologically advanced in the country, in September.\nKelly hopes his latest idea will be just as successful. \"We have to be practical. But this proves that, by starting later, children's learning improves, as does their health.\"\nFoster said, \"This is preliminary   data, but what's exciting is that it matches more detailed studies carried out in Canada and the US. Teenagers get up late not because they are lazy but because they are biologically programmed to do so.\""

      "Most people believe they don't have imagination. They are wrong. Everyone has imagination, but most of us,once we became adults, forget how to access it. Creativity isn't always connected with great works of art or ideas. People at work and in their free time routinely think of creative ways to solve problems. Maybe you have a goal to achieve,a tricky question to answer or you just want to expand your mind! Here are three techniques to help you.\nThis technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them. First,think about the problem you have to solve or the job you need to do. Then find an image,word,idea or object,for example,a candle. Write down all the ideas/words associated with candles:light,fire,matches, wax,night,silence,etc. Think of as many as you can. The next stage is to relate the ideas to the job you have to do. So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night.\nImagine that normal limitations don't exist. You have as much time/space/money,etc. as you want. Think about your goal and the new possibilities. If,for example,your goal is to learn to ski, you can now practice skiing every day of your life (because you have the time and the money). Now adapt this to reality. Maybe you can practice skiing every day in December,or every Monday in January.\nLook at the situation from a different point of view. Good negotiators use this technique in business,and so do writers. Fiction writers often imagine they are the characters in their books. They ask questions: what does this character want? Why can't she get it? What changes must she make to get what she wants? What does she dream about? If your goal involves other people, put yourself \"in their shoes\". The best fishermen think like fish!"

      "When my friend went to Europe last summer, instead of snapping photographs of the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower or Stonehenge, she brought back 32 rolls of ... cathedral ceilings. Ceilings. For the 10 years I've known her I had never suspected that she was this passionate about stained glass.\nStill one of the best things about such pictures -- despite their obvious narrow appeal -- is that they can't help but tell us a great deal about the people who took them.\nSo I shouldn't have been surprised when I got the roll of film back from my 5-year-old son's first camping trip. I opened the envelope, naively expecting to see pictures of the nightly campfire, the sun setting over the forest, and possibly even a deer or two.\nInstead, I saw an off-center picture of tennis shoes. Not even his tennis shoes, mind you, but a pair someone had lost and left in the cabin. Mystery shoes. And that's not all.\nAs I went through the stack, I found that my son had also taken a picture of his sleeping bag, a penny he found in the gravel next to the car, a leaf, an orange sock, a close-up of his father's ear, a burned hot dog, his thumb, a piece of gum, and many other similar things.\nThere was barely one sign of nature in the whole stack. I couldn't help thinking that if he'd wanted pictures of assorted junk, it would've been cheaper had he spent the weekend in our back-yard.\nAT LEAST that is what I thought until I showed the photographs to my ceiling-snapping friend, the mother of three teenagers, who said simply, \"There's nothing wrong with these.\"\nBut of course, this is just the type of answer you'd expect from someone who photographs ceiling.\nThen she told me about the time her daughter went to Yosemite Valley and returned with rolls of photographs of the hotel, restaurant, and gift shop. She also told me about the time her son took his camera to a Major League Baseball game and returned with 24 pictures of cloud formations.\nI had a feeling she was just trying to make me feel better.\nThen again, to a 5-year-old boy, finding a penny is more exciting than seeing a squirrel. And why would he waste good film on something like, say, some endangered water buffaloes, when he could take a picture of cool tennis shoes? Or his shiny new green sleeping bag?\nFace it: Things like beautiful sunsets and campfires can't compare to a bag of extra-large marshmallow.\nSo I did what any good mother would do: I marked the date on the back of the pictures and slid them into our family vacation photo album -- right after the five pages of ice sculptures I took last year on our cruise to the Bahamas."

Some Chinese parents are usually glad to see their children study late. They will think their children work very hard. But not all parents are happy about this. Once a mother told us that every morning her 10-year-old boy put up one finger with his eyes still closed, begging for one more minute to sleep. Like thousands of students \"early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning. \n  A report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late.

      "Any mistake made in the printing of a stamp raises its value to stamp collectors. A mistake on one inexpensive postage stamp has made the stamp worth a million and a half times its original value.\nThe mistake was made more than a hundred years ago in the British colony of Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean. In 1847 an order for stamps was sent to a London printer-Mauritius was to become the fourth country in the world to issue stamps.\nBefore the order was filled and delivered, a ball was planned at Mauritius' Government House, and stamps were needed to send out the invitations. A local printer was instructed to copy the design for the stamps. He accidentally inscribed the words \"Post Office\" instead of \"Post Paid\" on the several hundred stamps that he printed.\nToday there are only twenty-six of these misprinted stamps left fourteen One Penny Orange-Reds and twelve Two Penny Blues. Because of the Two Penny Blue's rareness and age, collectors have paid as much as $16 800 for it."

      "Pulling heavy suitcases all day in the summer is hard work, especially when you are a thin  14-year-old boy. That was me in 1940-the youngest and smallest baggage boy at New York City's Pennsylvania Railway Station.\nAfter just a few days on the job, I began noticing that the other fellows were overcharging  passengers. I'd like to join them, thinking, \"Everyone else is doing it.\"\nWhen I got home that night, I told my dad what I wanted to do. \"You give an honest day's   work,\" he said, looking at me straight in his eye. \"They are paying you. If they want to do that,   you let them do that.\"\nI followed my dad's advice for the rest of that summer and have lived by his words ever since.\nOf all the jobs I've had, it was my experience at Pennsylvania Railway Station that has stuck with me.

Everest,\" Romero's blog said. \"Their dreams have now come true. Everyone is happy.\"\nThe climbing has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents  . \"It is just a goal.\" Romero said. He had already climbed five peaks  , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, to hit his goal.\nThe youngest person before to climb Everest was 16-year-old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal. Romero climbed together with a team including his father Paul and three local guides. He wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world and wear it in a necklace. While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be at least 16, China does not have any age restrictions  . Some mountain climbers haven't agreed with the Romero family for letting him try it but his father said the climbing from the Chinese side is less dangerous."

      "For thousands of years, mankind has produced plants and animals to create more desired and useful plants and animals. For example, modern com has been produced to such a large size that it is no longer able to reproduce without man's assistance. Modern dairy cows produce too much milk and if they are not often emptied of milk, they could leak, burst, become infected, and possibly die. Besides, most dogs raised by people can not survive in the wild even with special training.\nSince natural evolution is extremely slow and mankind's selective production programs only take a few generations to produce a completely new species, natural evolution has already _ mankind's production programs. In addition, mankind has successfully killed off several species all together. For example, there are no more European wolves in existence and mammoths   probably died out because of mankind. Even certain diseases have been permanently got rid of from the planet, and dozens of other diseases will soon be too. Again, natural evolution did i>>t cause most of the destruction during man's rule of the world.\nCurrently, scientists are creating new species with desired characteristics in the lab significantly faster than natural evolution creates new species. In a single generation, new species can be created and destroyed by mankind, while natural evolution could take thousands of years to do the same but only accidentally. Scientists are even able to replace defective   or damaged genes with different genes to attempt to cure genetic defects. This is something that natural evolution could possibly never correct.\nEventually scientists will even be able to improve the quality of people. For example, imagine not only correcting your eyesight with gene treatment, but also ensuring that all of your children do not receive your old genes of poor eyesight too. Scientists will one day be able to improve the memory and intelligence of your children, so that they will do better in school and achieve more in life. Doctors and scientists will be able to customize   babies before they are born just like picking options at a car store."

Those who speak with an accent that \"often impedes\" comprehension will not pass. These rules take effect in January 2016.\nChina's 56 ethnic groups speak more than 80 languages and dialects. Even native Mandarin speakers can have trouble communicating with each other depending on the strength of their accents, which can be mutually unintelligible  .\nOne flight trainer illustrated the scope for linguistic confusion, especially when common English aviation terms are used. Asked if there is a problem on board, a Chinese pilot might answer in the negative with the words mei you, or \"there isn't. But someone speaking with a heavy Sichuan accent would pronounce mei you as \"May day\" - unconsciously parroting the universally recognized distress call  . \nLike their international counterparts  , Chinese aviators have developed codes to avoid confusion resulting from homonyms   or near-homonyms. They use the terms yao for one and guai for seven, which are otherwise pronounced yi and qi respectively and easily confused.\nThe new rule could affect all pilots, who must renew their license every six years, and adds to a growing list of burdens for the profession."

Modern businesses have been following his lead,with more tactics .\nOne tactic involves where to display the goods. Foe example, stores place fruits and vegetables in the first section. They know that customers who buy the healthy food first will feel happy so that they will buy more junk food later in their trip. In department stores, section is generally next to the women's cosmetics  section:while the shop assistant is going back to find the right size shoe, bored customers are likely to wander over cosmetics they might want to try later.\nBesides, businesses seek to appeal to customers' senses. Stores notice that the smell of baked goods encourages shopping, they make their own bread each morning and then fan the bread smell into the store throughout the day. Music sells goods, too. Researchers in Britain found that when French music was played, sales of French wine went up.\nWhen it comes to the selling of houses, businesses also use highly rewarding tactics. They find that customers make decision in the first few second upon walking in the door, and turn it into a business opportunity. A California builder designed the structure of its houses smartly. When entering the house, the customer would see the Pacific Ocean through the windows, and then the poll through an open stairway leading to the lower level. The instant view of water on both levels helped sell these $10 million houses."

      "When a child is told he is \"uncool\", it can be very painful. He may say he doesn't care, and even act in ways that are opposite of cool on purpose. But ultimately, these are simply ways to handle sadness by pretending it's not there.\nHelping a child feel better in school had to be careful. If you say, \"Why are you worried about what other children think about you? It doesn't matter!\"  Children know that it does matter. Instead, an active way may be best. You could say, \"I'm going to do a couple of things for you to help you feel better in school.\"\nIf a boy is having trouble making friends, the teacher can help him. The teacher can arrange things so that he has chances to use his abilities to contribute to class projects. This is how the other children learn how to value his good qualities and to like him. A teacher can also raise a child's popularity in the group by showing that he values that child. It even helps to put him in a seat next to a very popular child, or let him be a partner with that child in activities, etc.\nThere are things that parents can do at home, too. Be friendly when your child brings others home to play. Encourage him to invite friends to meals and then serve the dishes they consider \"super\". When you plan trips, picnics, movies, and other shows, invite another child with whom your child wants to be friends.\nWhat you can do is to give him a chance to join a group that may be shutting him out. Then, if he has good qualities, he can start to build real friendship of his own."

      "They tell us when to get up or when we're running late for work and whether we are in danger of missing our favourite TV programme. But while our daily routines rely on clocks that tell us the time, science is discovering that our well-being is influenced by a very different kind of timepiece. Circadian rhythms---the human body's own internal clock---have a powerful influence on our health and behaviour. _ are programmed from birth and control functions ranging from temperature and blood pressure to sleep patterns.\nIn recent years researchers have also discovered that this built-in mechanism can influence everything from the way we react to medicines to how well we learn music.\nThe latest example, from experts at Harvard University in the US, shows that the human body clock can even dictate whether or not we are likely to tell the truth. Researchers found it was easier for people to fib  in the afternoon because, as they were tired, the self control that would normally prevent them from lying started to break down. Tiredness made it harder to resist the temptation to tell lies---especially if it meant they got a financial reward at the end.\n\"The body clock has a great effect on us all,\" says Professor Jim Horne from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University. \"Most people tend to feel good around late morning and then decline in the early afternoon. But the time most of us will feel our sharpest is between 6pm and 8pm. That's because sleepiness tends to build up throughout the day. By early evening our body clock kicks in to wake us up. One reason may be to ensure we get home safely. When our ancestors were coming home after hunting all day their internal clocks kicked in to get them home in one piece.\"\nSo what effects do circadian rhythms have and what's the best time of day to take advantage of them?"

      "Millions of girls grow up with the hope of becoming a famous singer. Some even win local talent competitions as children, but only a few such early successes and dreams turn into reality. Jessica Andrews is one of the few whose dreams have come true.\nAndrews, first taste of success came at the age of 10. She won a talent competition in her home town of Huntingdon, Tennessee, singing I Will Always Love You, originally sung by Whitney Houston. Houston's version of the song appeared on The Bodyguard sound track, which happened to be the first album Andrews ever bought.\nWithin two years, talk of Andrews had spread to Nashville and caught the attention of producer Byron Gallimore, whose credits include work with Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Jo Dee Messina. With Gallimore signed on to produce, Andrews soon had a recording contract  with Dream Works' Nashville label.\nAndrews' professional career was launched with 1999's Heart Shaped World, recorded when she was 14 years old. The album included the country hit I Will Be There For You, which also appeared on The Prince Of Egypt . She followed up the release of the album by touring as a support act for such country superstars as Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood.\nWith the release of 2001's, Who I Am, Andrews became a star in her own right. The album was certified  gold for sales of 500,000 copies. Andrews returned in April 2003 with Now,an album that she promised would show a new side of the young artist. \"This album has a very different feeling for me,\" she said. \"It's a lot more personal and there's a confidence that wasn't quite there on the first two. I feel especially connected to this group of songs.\""

      "Certain plants and animals can survive under what seem like impossible conditions. Blind fish live freely under ocean depths that are  ly dark and cold. Bacteria live at temperatures of 600 degF or a higher in places where the heat comes from the deep earth. One of the most remarkable achievements that we can observe directly is the ability of the plants and animals in the desert.\nIn the Death Valley ,temperatures of 134 degF in the shade have been officially reported Yet lizards live there ,along with 600 species of plants, 30 species of mammals? and even fish. While the days are terribly hot, the nights are extremely cold. Temperatures can fall down by as much as 50 degF.\nPlants called xerophytes are perfectly adapted to the extremely dry conditions. These plants have survived by developing techniques for coping with their environment. Like all living things ,they must have water ,and they get it in several ways.\nThe mesquite and the prickly  pear pick up moisture in opposite ways. The mesquite sends its roots down as deep as 60 feet to tap the water table. The prickly pear, on the other hand ,spreads its roots wide. These roots are shallow but they pick up whatever moisture is available at ground level. The paloverde saves water by shedding leaves in times of extreme drought The barrel cactus makes sure of a water supply by storing water in the plant itself. The saguaro cactus stores so much water that it can survive years of drought. But even the saguaro will die sooner or later if there is no rain. All these plants ,although well adjusted to their environment, must eventually get water.\nEven if the parent plants die, there are always seeds to keep the species alive. Since the desert is so tough, thousands of seeds must be released to produce one plant. To get rooted, these seeds must have exactly the right conditions. They can lie dormant for months, even years, until a little water stimulates the sparks of life."

      "Most people consider skydiving   a product of the 20th century, but its history actually goes further back than that. The Chinese attempted to parachute   in the 10th century, a thousand years before we did. The Chinese did what we would today call base diving; that is, they jumped off a place that would allow them to float from a height to the ground.\nThe first person to attempt to parachute was a Frenchman named Jacques Garnerin. He jumped from his hot-air balloon at the end of the 18th century and did tricks on the way down and _ the crowds by landing safely on the ground. At the end of the 19th century, Kathie Paulus, a brave German woman, became famous for her skydiving skills.\nOnce the airplane was invented, skydiving took on a whole new form. The airplane made it possible to dive from greater heights at greater speeds, allowing for more range in the movements in the air. A woman named Tiny Broadwick became the first woman to jump from a plane in 1913 and dive free fall in 1914.\nSkydiving was not called skydiving until the middle of the 1950s, when Ronald Young invented the word. It had been called parachuting before this and was mainly used by the military   to land troops in inland locations, or for pilots to jump out of their planes when necessary. Once World War I was over, parachuting became a sport, which we now call skydiving.\nAfter World War II, this activity became more a hobby than a military action. Soldiers were trained in parachuting and enjoyed the thrill so much that they continued on for fun. From this, teams and competitions were formed. Skydiving schools appeared in the late 1950s and now it is a recognized extreme sport enjoyed by many."

      "The slogan \"a dog is for life, not just for Christmas\" has been going strong for 27 years now. Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven't quite got the message.\nThe slogan still holds good. Some 105,000 dogs were _ by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.\nThe main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.\nBut Eleanor Silk, the Trust's communications director, says, \"It's often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn't been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.\"\nIn any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy  as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children. It's hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What's more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children. It encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.\nAppreciating what you're taking on with a dog can be a sobering   realization. \"For life\" means thinking about the effect they'll have on your life. It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its whole life."

      "Owning a smartphone may not be as smart as you think.They may let you surf the Internet,listen to music and snap photos wherever you are...but they also turn you into a workaholic,it seems.A study suggests that,by giving you access to emails at all times.the all-singing.all-dancing mobile phone adds as much as two hours to your working day.\nResearchers found that Britons work an additional 460hours a year on average as they are able to respond to emails on their mobiles.The study by technology retailer Pixmania,reveals the average UK working day is between nine and ten hours,but a further two hours is spent responding to or sending work emails,or making work calls.Almost one in ten admits spending up to three hours outside their normal working day checking work emails.Some workers confess they are on call almost 24 hours a day,with nine out\nof ten saying they take work emails and calls outside their normal working hours.Nearly two-thirds say they often check work emails just before they go to bed and as soon as they wake up,while over a third have replied to one in the middle of the night.\nGhadi Hobeika,marketing director of Pixmania,said:\"The ability to access literally millions of apps,keep in contact via social networks and take photos and video as well as text and call has\nmade smartphones valuable for many people.However,there are _ .Many companies expect their employees to be on call 24 hours a day,seven days a week,and smartphones mean that people literally cannot get away from work.The more constantly in contact we become.

      "NOT all math skills are learned in the classroom. Some of them come naturally. Consider the split-second calculations  you make when you estimate   the number of empty seats on the school bus or the number of cookies in a cookie jar.\nThese estimates can often be done without counting. That's because humans are born with the ability to closely guess the number of items in a group. Researchers call this ability a person's \"number sense\".\nTo see how a person's inborn number sense might be linked to mathematical performance in the classroom, psychologist Justin Halberda and his colleagues from Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Baltimore,USran some tests.\nThe scientists asked 64 14-year-olds to look at images   of yellow and blue dots that flashed on a computer screen for a fraction   of a second. Each image contained between 10 and 32 dots that varied in size.\nSome images contained twice as many blue dots  as yellow dots. In other images, however, the number of blue and yellow dots was nearly equal. For each image, the students were asked to estimate which color1 had more dots.\nThe scientists found a wide variation in how well students could pick the color1 with the most dots.\nThe scientists then looked at the students' math scores dating back to kindergarten. Children that performed best in the image test also scored the highest in standard math tests.\nThe same finding held true at the other end of the spectrum  . Students who didn't score well on the image test received lower math scores.\nThe study was the first to show a link between a person's inborn number sense and his or her achievement in formal math training.\nDoes this connection mean that one cannot be good in math if they have a weak number sense? Or that having a strong number sense is a guarantee for good grades in math? The answers are not clear.\nWhile scientists continue looking at the possible links between a person's number sense and math achievement, one thing is certain: Doing lots of math homework will   _ your chances of success."

      "Europe is now the biggest market for organic food in the world, having grown by 25 percent a year over the past 10 years. Denmark's agriculture minister is herself an organic farmer. The UK market for organic food grew by 55 percent in 2000, while the food market as a whole grew by only one percent. Yet only seven percent of British shoppers account for nearly 60 percent of organic sales. However popular the idea of organic farming may be, it is still an interest for only a few people.\nSo what makes the idea of organic farming popular? Organic farming means farming with natural materials, rather than with man-made fertilizers or pesticides . Organic farmers rely on many methods -- such as crop rotation   and the use of resistant varieties, because they are necessary for organic farmers to _ the shortage of man-made chemicals.\nOrganic farming is often supposed to be safer than traditional farming for the environment. Yet after a long research on organic farming worldwide for a number of years, science continues to be against this opinion. The House of Commons committee on agriculture stated that, even with complete research work, it would fail to find any scientific evidence to prove \"that any of claims made for organic farming is always true\".\nHowever, the talk about the benefits of organic farming is going on. This is partly because many people depend on their individual farm, the soil, the weather, and so on."

      "When we see well, we do not think about our eyes very often. It is only when we cannot see perfectly that we realize how important our eyes are.\nPeople who are near-sighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Everything else seems blurry (unclear). Many people who do a lot of work, such as writing, reading and sewing become near--sighted.\nPeople who are far-sighted _ from just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty in reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses, too.\nOther people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. They have what is called astigmatism  . This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts  . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them.\nHaving two good eyes is important for judging distances. Each eye sees things from a slightly different angle. To prove this to yourself, look at an object out of one eye; then look at the same object out of your other eye. You will find the object's relation to the background and other things around it has changed. The difference between these two different eye views helps us to judge how far away an object is. People who have only one eye cannot judge distance as people with two eyes."

      "If you want to pay a visit to Iceland, you'll enter a whole new region of experience. You'll discover original nature as you've never seen it before. The freedom to wander  in the city or the wilds as you please is the key to the Iceland experience.\nReykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is just a part of the Icelandic experience with its midnight sun or the magical landscapes mixed with ice and fire. Reykjavik has a population of around 170,000 and offers an interesting mix of culture and local village roots.\nOld accounts say the ancient gods themselves guided Iceland's first settler to make his home in Reykjavik. He named the place Reykjavik (Steamy Bay)after the geothermal steam he saw, which today heats homes and outdoor swimming pools throughout the city, a pollution-free energy source that leaves the air very fresh, clean and clear.\nA beautiful river runs through the city limits, and so do fine parks and even wild outdoor areas. Against this backcloth of nature, Reykjavik has a packed program of familiar city joys too: art museums, several theaters, an opera house, a symphony orchestra and concerts meeting the needs of all ages and tastes.\nOne must for all visitors is dining out on Icelandic specialties, including delicious seafood, ocean-fresh from the morning' s catch, highland lamb and unusual varieties of game. Its purely natural food is imaginatively served to delight the most discerning of diners. Reykjavik is also famous as one of Europe's hottest nightspots, where the action on the friendly pub and nightlife scene lasts right through the night. In the evening, the downtown area is filled with activity, reaching its peak on Friday or Saturday. The number of pubs, cafe, discos, and other nightspots in the downtown area is astonishing. There is a rich variety of places to go: European-style cafes, nightclubs with live entertainment, dance halls for seniors, sports-theme pubs with big TV screens, cafes that offer over 100 types of beer, an Irish pub, a Spanish cafe, a French wine bar.\nWalking distances are short downtown, and everything worth seeing outside the city center can be quickly and conveniently reached by bus. With its long, easy-going main street and large shopping mall, Iceland's capital is a great place to shop too -- with a bonus of tax-free shopping for visitors!\n A full range of accommodations is available in Reykjavik, from international-standard hotels with good conference facilities, through smaller hotels and comfortable guesthouses, to a campsite in the city's biggest park."

The Isle of Wight is one of the main tourist attractions. Here is some information on a few of the attractions on the IOW.\nDinosaur Isle\nIt is located in Sandown, a seaside town on the southeast coast. It's a large, lovely museum, both fun and educational. Here you can see a large fossil collection of all kinds of dinosaurs, as well as a gift shop. You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games. It has five new gardens, and offers great opportunities to see and take pictures of the rare red squirrels.\nThe West of the Wight\nHere we have the Marine Aquarium, the Archaeology Exhibition and the Model Railway. They offer another opportunity to combine fun with learning. This is a great place to see ancient boats crossing the narrow strait between the island and the mainland.\nThe Wight Bus Museum\nThis museum is run completely by unpaid volunteers. It has a bus collection stored in what was once a warehouse . Most of the buses in the museum date back to around the 1910's.\nWith all of these choices, what are you waiting for?

      "It's 5pm on a Friday and I'm standing in a coffee shop above Shibuya crossing - one of the most busiest place in Japan where more than a thousand of Tokyo's smartly dressed people gather at eight points, ready to cross - then rush straight for each other. It looks like they must bump into each other, but It's amazing that they all manage to reach the other side safely.\nBut the real reason I'm here is that I want to see people crash. I want businessmen to knock into each other, their umbrellas flying off their arms, and uniformed schoolchildren hitting grannies. Why may I see this now, but wouldn't have had the chance even a year ago? It's very simple - smartphones.\nSmartphone use is booming in Japan. In 2012, only about a quarter of Japanese used them, most being perfectly happy with their everyday mobiles. But now more than half of all Japanese now own a smartphone and the number is rising fast. But with that rise has grown another phenomenon - the smartphone walk. Those people who're staring at a phone screen adopt this kind of pace- their head down, arms outreached, looking like zombies trying to find human prey .\nSurprisingly, an American named Michael Cucek who has lived here for more than 20 years told me smartphone walk probably wouldn't be a long-term problem. Japanese phone manner is in fact better than anywhere else in the world - hardly anyone speaks on their phones on trains, and teenagers wouldn't dare broadcast music out of one. If things got truly bad at Shibuya, the police would just start shouting at people to look up.\nBut really, is the smartphone walk such an annoying problem? There's only one way to find out. So I leave the coffee shop, head down to the crossing and start typing an email, promising myself I won't look up until I get to the other side. When they start walking past me, it's my time to cross. As I step forward, the experience quickly becomes nervous - legs jump in and out of my vision without warning, while shopping bags fly towards my face before being pulled away at the last moment. I'm sure I'm going to get hit, but after a few seconds I relax. It's OK. Everyone's reacting for me.\nI expect to see two smartphone walkers just like me. But instead I find a young couple, very much in love and very much refusing to let each other's hands go just to give way to a fool on his smartphone. The girl gives me such a look of dislike that I quickly apologize and rush round them. That look was enough to ensure I'll never be smartphone walking again."

It can be hard for us kids to talk about what really matters. But spending time together can build the relationship, and create chances to talk. Go for a hike or a game. Work on the car. Whatever you're into, ask your dad to do it together.\nFight fair. Family disagreements are unavoidable.  _ , keep your mouth respectful and cool off before you say something bad. Talk it out when you can do so calmly.\nRealize respect. Face it: your dad's been given authority   to help guide you as you know. He's going to make mistakes, but so are you. Forgive him when he blows it, and honor his decisions--even if you don't agree."

      "Mattel Inc. is _ 4.4 million Polly Pocket toys with magnets after some of them caused serious injuries to children who swallowed magnets that fell off.\nTiny magnets inside the toys may fall off without being noticed by parents and babysitters. The magnets can be swallowed or placed in children's noses or ears. When more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other and cause intestine perforation which can be deadly.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC)received 170 reports of the small magnets coming out of these recalled toys. There were three reports of serious injuries to children who swallowed more than one magnet. All three suffered intestinal perforations that required operation. A 2-year-old child stayed in hospital for seven days and a 7-year-old child was hospitalized for 12 days. An 8-yeal-old child was also hospitalized.\nThe recalled Polly Pocket toys contain plastic dolls and accessories that have small magnets. The magnets measure one-eighth inch in diameter and are fixed in the hands and feet of some dolls, and even in the plastic clothing, hairpieces and other accessories to help the pieces stay on the doll or the doll's house.\nThe model number is printed on the bottom of the largest pieces on some of the toys. Contact Mattel if you cannot find a model number on your product to determine if it is part of the recall. Polly Pocket magnetic toys currently sold in stores are not included in this recall. The model numbers included in the recall are: B2632, B3158, B3201, B7118, G8605, H1537, H1538 and H3211. The toys were on sales in department stores and toy stores from May 2006 through September 2009 for between $15 and $30.\nConsumers should immediately take these recalled toys away from children and contact Mattel for the return of the toys. For more information contact Mattel at 888 597-6597 anytime or visit the company's Web site."

      "My mother used to ask me what the most important part of the body is. Through the years Iwould take a guess at what I thought was the correct answer. When I was younger, I thought sound was very important to us as humans, so I said: \"My ears, Mommy.\" She said: \"No. Many people are deaf. But you keep thinking about it and I will ask you again soon.\"Several years passed before she asked me again. Since making my first attempt, I had contemplated the correct answer. So this time I told her: \"Mommy, sight is very important to everybody, so it must be our eyes.\" She looked at me and told me: \"You are learning fast, but the answer is not correct because there are many people who are blind.\"\nMother asked me a couple more times and always her answer was \"No. But you are getting smarter every year, my child.\"Then last year, my grandpa died. Everybody was hurt. Everybody was crying. My momlooked at me when it was our turn to say our final goodbye to grandpa. She asked me: \"Do you know the most important body part yet, my dear?\"\nI was  shocked  when  she  asked  me  this  now. She  told  me:  \"This  question is very important,especially at this moment. How you answer it can truly shows whether you have\nlearned about life. For every body part you gave me in the past, I have told you were wrong\nand I have given you an example why. But today is the day you need to learn this important\nlesson.\"\nI saw her eyes well up with tears. She said: \"My dear, the most important body part is your\nshoulder.\"\"Is it because it holds up my head?\" I asked.\"No, it is because it can hold the head of a friend or a loved one when they cry,\" she replied:\"Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on somet ime in life, my dear.

      "\"No man is an island\" is a well-known line from John Donne's Devotion. It was written more than three hundred years ago. Even now people still agree with him. No one can live a completely lonely life. Without other people, life will become empty and sad. We all need to have friends.\nFor some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move. It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have.\nThere are many books about friendship, but Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, written in 1936, is the most famous. This \"how to\" book about getting along with other people became a best seller. It was later put into 28 languages.\nDale Carnegie's advice seems to be simple, but can his advice help you? Do you need to change the way you act? Here is the list of advice from his book:\nBe friendly and polite.\nAlways greet with a smile. Begin with \"Excuse me\" or \"Would you please\" when you want to ask somebody. Remember to say \"Thank you\" and try to be as helpful as you can.\nGo out of your way to be nice.\nFind some time to do special things for other people. Making some soup for a sick neighbour may seem like a little thing to you, but it will make your neighbor feel a lot better.\nRemember names.\nThey say that the sweetest music to a person's ears is the sound of his or her own name.\nBe open-minded.\nTry to understand other people's ways and ideas and learn something from them.\nListen patiently.\nWhen someone is talking to you, look at him or her, listen carefully and say something when necessary."

      "Then comes July, and with it examinations, but these are soon finished and with them ends the school year. Boys and girls have nearly two months' holiday before them as they leave school by train and car to return home to their fathers and mothers.\nThe summer holidays are the best part of the year for most children. The weather is usually good, so that one can spend most of one's time playing in the garden or, if one lives in the country, out in the woods and fields. Even if one lives in a big town, one can usually go to a park to play.\nThe best place for a summer holiday, however, is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea, but for the others who do not, a week or two at one of the big seaside towns is something that they will talk about for the whole of the following year.\nIn England, it is not only the rich who can take their children to the seaside; if a factory worker or a bus driver, a street cleaner or a waiter wants to take his wife and children to Southend or Margate, Blackpoor or Clacton, he is usually quite able to do so.\nNow, what is it that children like so much about the seaside? I think it is the sand, sea and sun more than any other things. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do, but it is the feeling of sand under one's feet, of salt water on one's skin, and of the warm sun on one's back that make the seaside what it is."

      "Vampires  , creatures of myth, have been around in one form or another for centuries. Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.\nBut just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are \"culturally adaptive \". \"We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,\" she said.\nDifferent as they are, Wells believes vampires are \"the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties\". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.\nAccording to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.\n\"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,\" said Wells. \"The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death.\""

      "A Scottish woman has given birth to twins for the third time. Karen Rodger, 41, welcomed her first pair of girls rowan and Isla after having twice given birth to twin boys.\n\"I still haven't really taken it on board because I was convinced I was having two boys,\" Rodger told Sky News. Karen said her husband Colin was equally stunned when the couple learned they were going to have their fifth and sixth child. \"He thought I was joking and immediately wrote back to say 'this is not funny'. I had to explain that it really was true,\" Karen said.\nThe average couple has about a 3 percent chance of having twins when not accounting for fertility drugs. And with each following pregnancy, the changes of producing twins a second, or even third time, become less.\nKaren, a dance lecturer, first learned of the incredibly rare occurrence during a visit to her doctor and immediately texted her husband to share the news. \"I just could not believe it. It never crossed my mind that it would be twins again. I just thought that wouldn't happen to people like me, but I'm  ly delighted,\" she said.\nIt had been several years since the couple's last children were born. Their oldest twins are 14 and the second set was born just two years later. \"I turned 40 and I thought, if I'm going to do it, I should do it now,\" Karen said. \"I spoken to my husband and we both thought we'd quite like another one so that was it and, one month later, I was pregnant.\" \nColin says the age and gender difference will ensure a sweat-inducing dilemma for any future suitors of the twin girls. It will be a frightening challenge for any boyfriend."

      "Culture helps human societies survive in changing natural environment.For example, the end of the last Ice Age, beginning about 15,000 years ago, brought a big challenge to which humans had to adapt.Before this time, large parts of the northern hemisphere were covered in great sheets of ice that contained much of the earth' s water.In North America, large animals that wandered the vast tundra   provided people with food and materials for clothing and simple shelters.When the earth became warm, large Ice Age animals disappeared, and many land areas were covered by rising sea levels from melting ice.But people survived, they developed new technologies and learned how to survive on new plant and animal species. Finally some people settled into permanent villages, durable houses and farms.\nCultural adaptation has made humans one of the most successful species on the planet. Through history, major developments in technology, medicine, and nutrition have allowed people to reproduce and survive in ever-increasing numbers.The global population has risen from 8 million during the Ice Age to about 6 billion today.\nHowever, the successes of culture adaptation can also create problems in the long run.Over the last 200 years, people have begun to use large quantities of natural resources and energy and to produce a great amount of material and chemical wastes.The global population now consumes some important natural resources--such as petroleum, wood, and minerals--faster than nature can produce them.Many scientists believe that in the process of burning fuels and producing wastes, people may be changing the global climate in unpredictable and possibly harmful ways.Thus, the adaptive success of the present-day global culture of production and trade may be temporary."

      "Another of President Bush's critics on climate change and his former rival for the White House, Al Gore, is inprefix = st1 /Londonon Friday to launch an environmental project with the head of the Virgin Business Company, Richard Branson. They're announcing a multi-million dollar international prize to encourage development and research into new forms of low carbon technology. The prize will be available to anyone who can apply a successful method of removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n     Almost all scientists agree that we are experiencing global warming due to increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released when fuel is burned. Oil, coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas. When biological wasted breaks down, it also releases carbon dioxide.\n     Environmental campaigners and climate change scientists tell us we're pumping an unbearable amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One way to reduce that will be to use less fossil fuel , the burning of which is a key resource to our way of life, but sharp reduction of oil and coal use is unpopular with governments and people alike.\nSo technologies are being developed, like carbon capture and storage that aim to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, compress  it and pump it into the ground. But that's still in its early stages, so the purpose of this prize is to encourage research into new ways of decarbonizing the atmosphere. A scientific panel, chaired by Al Gore, will judge any entries. Environmental campaigners are hoping such a significant prize will attract large amounts of publicity and brainpower."

      "Nathan's second-hand bike was good enough to get him anywhere he wanted to go. Of course, it couldn't match Tim's in a normal speed race, but all the fancy gears   in the world wouldn't get you up Black Mountain. It was so steep in places that you had to get off your bike and push. \nOn this particular afternoon, the odds were all on Nathan's side. First, he was stronger. Tim had always been thin, but recently he'd started to grow so fast that his arms and legs were like pieces of spaghetti. As well as being considerably fitter than his friend, Nathan knew the shortcuts up prefix = st1 /BlackMountain. \nSo when Nathan accepted the challenge, he was sure he'd win. He nearly always did, in competitions with Tim. That was what was strange. Tim was so competitive, and yet he wasn't any good at physical things. \nBy the time the two boys were three quarters of the way to the top, Nathan was clearly ahead. While the road zigzagged back and forth up the mountainside, in certain places, there were also vertical tracks, where water rushing down the slope in winter had bitten erosion courses into the soil. These had in turn been so overgrown by bushes and long grass in the spring that they looked like tunnels through the bush. The trick was to know where you could cut off a whole bend in the road by leaving the road and pushing your bike up one of these half-hidden pathways. If you chose the wrong one you'd struggle up for ten minutes and then suddenly reach a dead end. Then there was no choice but to go back."

      "Teamwork is all about working together to achieve a common goal or purpose.Is teamwork out of date?Why it is so hard to effectively conduct teamwork in those things?\nOne way we employ teamwork in everyday lives is by becoming a parent.It is a parent's job to teach their children the fundamental skills and give them the knowledge they need to be successful in life.So why is teamwork disappearing in this aspect of our lives?Well in today's society,we find that more and more parents are experiencing that the teamwork is one-sided thing.According to a 2009report from the US,there are 13.7million single parents raising their children in the US and this amount could be due to the fact that parents are not stepping up and taking responsibility for their children or they don't have the means to,so they leave one parent to do it by themselves.This is a saddening fact,but it reflects that effective teamwork is losing ground in the parenting aspect of our everyday lives.\nAnother place where teamwork affects us greatly is in our jobs.It doesn't matter if you are a small or large company; if you have at least one employee and yourself,then teamwork will be present.I have noticed that with the current economic recession ,people are racing to grab jobs but the quality of people work has gone down greatly.It just appears to me that people do not take part in their work anymore.They want to get to work and work as fast as they can,just to receive the paycheck,but their quality standards   flew right out the window.This type of behavior is where I think teamwork is losing its ground in the workforce.There are too many people who want to work independently and forget they are a part of a team.\nAs you can see,we run into the aspects of teamwork in just about everything we do.Do you believe teamwork is really losing ground in today's society?I think it is.What's your opinion?"

      "One silly question I simply can't understand is \"How do you feel?\" Usually the question I asked of a man's action--a man on the go, walking along the street or busily working at his desk. So what do you expect him to say? He'll probably say, \"Fine, I'm all right, \" but you've put a bug in his ear--maybe now he's not sure. If you are a good friend, you may have seen something in his face, or his walk, that he overlooked  that morning. It starts him worrying a little. First thing you know, he looks in a mirror to see if everything is all right, while you go merrily on your way asking someone else. \"How do you feel?\"\n  Every question has its time and place. It's perfectly acceptable, for example, to ask \"How do you feel?\" if you're visiting a close friend in hospital. But if the fellow is walking on both legs, hurrying take a train, or sitting at his desk working, it's no time to ask him that silly question. \n  When George Bernard Shaw, the famous writer of plays, was in his eighties, someone asked him, \"How do you feel?\" Shaw put him in his place. \"When you reach my age, \" he said, \"either you feel all right or you're dead. \""

      "During a state of deep relaxation, several physiological changes take place in the body: the body's oxygen consumption is reduced; the heart beat decreases; muscle tension and sweating ease, and there is decreased sympathetic   nervous system activity.This restful state not only allows the body to repair and restore itself, but it has a calming effect on the consciousness.\nHow to achieve this state of relaxation, however, is a matter of opinion, and in some medical circles, a matter of controversy.A recent report by Dr.David Holmes of the University of Kansas in the journal \"American psychologist\" said that simply sitting in an armchair has just as many beneficial characteristics for the body as meditation   does.Researchers of other relaxation techniques disagree.These experts believe that more structured techniques, such as meditation, lead to a condition of deep relaxation.\nThe debate goes on, but one thing appears to be clear: the relaxation response can be reached by a number of methods, and the methods themselves are not as important as _ .One day, one method may work best; on another day, an alternative method may be more appropriate.Once you are aware of all the methods, you can find the one that works best on you.\nSome of the relaxation techniques are meditation, auto analysis and progressive muscle relaxation response.More than just sitting quietly in a chair, they have the added benefit of structure and discipline, and for these reasons appear to be more effective for most individuals."

      "If you are thinking of putting your child in a private high school instead of a public one, you should do some research. You will find that most private schools offer some advantages.\nOne of the most important details of a good high school is small class size. Many public schools might have 30 or even 35 students in each class. However, many private schools limit the size to about 15 to 20 kids per class. This is a good thing because it allows each teacher to offer every student more attention.\nAnother thing to mention is the interesting classes. For example, while the typical   high school might only offer Spanish and French as foreign languages, private schools often have several other languages to choose from. This is especially important if your child is actually interested in studying a particular language that is not usually offered. Of course, many colleges also consider the various   classes as a good thing, since they can teach students more different subjects than usual.\nSome colleges actually work closely with schools to make sure students are prepared well to get an advanced education. This means that teachers are careful to teach skills that can be used in college. Also, college teachers may be on-hand to talk to students and give them advice. If you think your child could use some help of this kind, which would likely help prepare him or her for college, you should look into schools offering these things.\nA simple visit to the website or campus   of a local private high school could give you the answers you are looking for. If you think your child would benefit from and appreciate these advantages, you should start researching. You are sure to find at least _ that offers these benefits."

      "The story of Juno and Lucas is one of the most touching stories about the amazing relationship between humans and their companion animals.\nJuno is a Belgian Malinois . The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility.\nLucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years.\nChester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal.\nNot terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed  in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure  or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.\"\nCompanion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences. I know that I held my adopted dog a little closer after hearing this story. There are a lot of dogs out there that need good homes and that won't be as lucky as Juno. So, if you think you're prepared, you should consider giving one a nice home."

      "Shakespeare's Sister\nLet us imagine, since facts are so hard to come by, what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully gifted sister, called Judith.\nShakespeare himself went, very probably -- his mother was an heiress -- to the grammar school, where he may have learnt Latin -- Ovid, Virgil and Horace -- and the elements of grammar and logic. He was, it is well known, a wild boy who poached   rabbits, perhaps shot a deer, and had, rather sooner than he should have done, to marry a woman in the neighborhood, who bore him a child rather quicker than was right. That escapade sent him to seek his fortune in London. He had, it seemed, a taste for the theatre; he began by holding horses at the stage door. Very soon he got work in the theatre, became a successful actor, and lived at the centre of the universe, meeting everybody, knowing everybody, practicing his art on the boards, exercising his wits in the streets, and even getting access to the palace of the queen.\nMeanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister remained at home. She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as curious to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school. She had no chance of learning grammar and logic, let alone of reading Horace and Virgil. She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew  and not moon about with books and papers. They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were practical people who knew the conditions of life for a woman. Soon, however, before she was out of her teens, she was to be engaged to the son of a neighboring wool stapler . She cried out that marriage was hateful to her, and for that she was severely beaten by her father. Then he ceased to scold her. He begged her instead not to hurt him, not to shame him in this matter of her marriage. He would give her a chain of beads or fine dresses, he said; and there were tears in his eyes. How could she disobey him? How could she break his heart?\nThe force of her own gift alone drove her to it. She made up a small parcel of her belongings, let herself down by a rope one summer's night and took the road to London. She was not seventeen. The birds that sang in the woods were not more musical than she was. She had the quickest fancy, a gift like her brother's, for the tune of words. Like him, she had a taste for the theatre. She stood at the stage door; she wanted to act, she said. Men laughed in her face. The manager -- a fat, loose-lipped man -- howled with laughter. He roared something about puppies dancing and women acting -- no woman, he said, could possibly be an actress. She could get no training in her craft. Could she even seek her dinner in a bar or roam   the streets at midnight? Yet her genius was for fiction and lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their ways. At last -- for she was very young, oddly like Shakespeare the poet in her face, with the same grey eyes and rounded brows -- at last Nick Greene the actor-manager took pity on her; she found herself with child by that gentleman and so -- who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet's heart when caught and confined in a woman's body? -- killed herself one winter's night and lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses   now stop outside the Elephant and Castle.\nThat, more or less, is how the story would run, if a woman in Shakespeare's day had had Shakespeare's genius."

      "Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of.It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices.By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living.By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment.It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more.\nAnd perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of  reasonable value in the products and services you buy.Apart from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements.He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising.He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the low-quality article more than once.If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.\nWhat' s more, advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can think of.\nThere is one more point I feel I ought to touch on.Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs.He was drawing excessively fine distinctions course advertising seeks to persuade.\nIf its message were restricted merely to information, which would be difficult to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive, advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention.But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants."

      "Struggling in the US? Move to China!\nI graduated from the university with a degree of civil engineering. It is a good field but my heart was not in it. I wanted to be an actor or work in the entertainment industry...living a creative life. My choice of civil engineering was really a mistake but I realized too late. As soon as I graduated, I moved straight to Los Angeles--the home of the film and television industry!\nFor three years, I tried to get a job in that field. I often worked as an extra in movies and TV shows--standing in the background while actors are in the foreground. This was fun for a while, but I wanted a real acting job, where I was speaking! Sadly, in Los Angeles, there is too much competition. Every race and age is represented: old, young, black, white, Asian and thousands of blondish-red haired Midwestern types like me. Being an extra couldn't make enough money for me to live in Los Angeles. I had to do something else for money.\nAfter three years of trying, I gave up my dream of being an actor and started a different career. I then tried network-marketing, but in the end, that failed. Seven years after graduating college, I was still in debt, still searching for a satisfactory life. I decided to go back to civil engineering.\nHowever, I was starting to get very disappointed with my life. Why is life not like what I expected?

      "When people talk about Golden Age in Leadville, Horace Austin Warner Tabor and his second wife, Elizabeth McCourt must be included. Their story is becoming one of the legends of the Old West. H.A.W.Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont in 1855 to settle in Kansas. Perhaps he was attracted by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. A few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\"he said.\nAs it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store selling everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. He often \"grubstook\" miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or\"grub\", while they looked for more. In return he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for several years,but nobody he helped ever found anything of value.\nFinally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came               in               and asked for \"grub\".Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. They were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them, \" Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich amount of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \"Pittsburgh Mine,\"made $300 000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment.               \nLater Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117 000. This turned out to be even more successful than the Pittsburgh, earning $35 000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor."

      "Winter is the time of year when people feel very blessed. This isn't because people feel thankful for the cold weather, nor because the important festivals---Christmas or Spring Festival---offer an excuse to celebrate. In fact, \"Bless you!\" is a common response if someone sneezes, a symptom of catching a cold or the flu.\nColds and the flu are the most common illnesses of autumn and winter as the weather gets colder. Viruses cause them. If you get one you will feel annoyed, but it is not usually serious. The flu is spread from person to person when we come into contact with a person with the virus. We get the virus on our hands and then we touch our noses and our mouths. We can pass on the flu before we realize we have it. You can infect  others one day before symptoms develop and for up to five days after becoming sick.\nGetting a flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the illness.

      "The day the letter arrived from my university telling me how much I owed them for my first semester, I felt a lump forming in my throat. I hadn't even started my degree and already I was in debt. But although the sum was unsettling, I had peace of mind: I had taken out a loan that would cover the next three years of tuition fees and living expenses.\nA government body in the UK, the Student Loans Company, provides loans to students whose parents cannot afford to cover the costs themselves. Students forward this amount to the university in advance and agree to repay the loan when they begin their first job. For me, it was a lot of money -around &6,000(60,860 Yuan) per year in total -and much more than I had ever been responsible for. I would receive a couple of thousand pounds per semester -half for tuition fees, half for living costs. \nEven though I will be paying off my debt for a long time, I don't regret my decision. \nHaving a loan taught me a lot about money management, which I would not have learned otherwise. Each term I paid my tuition fees in one payment, but I also received my loan for living costs in one payment. It was up to me to organize how I would spend this. \nI divided the amount to calculate my weekly budget and it was important that I tried not to overspend. I had to be disciplined and keep a close eye on my expenditure. Food, clothes and going out are the main things students spend money on. \nWith a loan, students have total financial freedom. Instead of having someone looking over their shoulder, they must make every financial decision for themselves. \nThis year, university fees were tripled. But when it comes to money management, perhaps this generation will be the smartest yet."

      "I have a painfully vivid memory of my first homecoming from college, in December 1983. After three whole months away, I was back home with my brand new opinions, attitudes and tastes. How could they watch such terrible television programs? I, the English Literature major with Shakespeare and Milton and James Joyce, could hardly bear to sleep under the roof of a house whose few bookshelves held thrillers and bound editions of the Reader's Digest. I'm sure my family was glad to see the back of me when, at the end of the holiday, I packed up my books and headed back up to university in the north of England.\nBut the next year must have been even more painful to my parents: I didn't show up at all. Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with young people spending a little time away from their families and with their friends.  It's part of growing up, something you need to do if you are to become properly independent. However, if you're not going to be home for the festival, you should at least have the decency to telephone and say you're not coming.\nIn English we have an expression, \"wet behind the ears.\" A person who is wet behind the ears is so immature, that they don't know how to dry the back of their head after a bath. Just before the following year's holiday I fell ill, quite seriously so. I'm sure my own behavior contributed to my getting sick: staying out too late, not eating properly--perhaps you know someone like the person I was then. I lay in bed with a fever, feeling very sorry for myself.\nI'm sure you can guess who came to my rescue. My long-suffering parents got in their car and sped up the motorway to rescue their son from the consequences of his own irresponsibility.\nI hope I'm a better son now; if not, it's getting a little late in the day if I want to change. I've worked in China for nearly 10 years and so I don't get to see them as often as I like, but my parents are online all the time so we talk many times each week. And this Spring Festival I will be flying back to England for a visit.\nI'm really looking forward to it."

      "If you're a man and you're reading this, congratulations: you're a survivor. According to statistics, you're more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Even if you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman.\n  There're many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor.\n  \"Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should,\" says Dr. Gullotta. \"This is particularly so for the over-40s, when chances of diseases are higher .\"\n  Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year.\n  Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old man who had delayed doing anything about his smoker's cough for a year.\n  \"When I finally saw him it had already spread and he later died from lung cancer,\" he says. \"Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged   his life.\"\n  According to a recent survey, 95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.\n  \"A lot of men think they're invincible  ,\" Gullotta says. \"They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think, 'Geez, if it could happen to him, ...'\"\n  Then there's the ostrich approach. \"Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,\" says Dr, Ross Cartmill.\n  \"Most men get their cars serviced more often than they service their bodies,\" Cartmill says. He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be found by regular check-ups.\nRegular check-ups for men would put strain   on the public purse, Cartmill says. \"But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the final cost is far greater; it's called premature  death.\""

      "\"Humans have a code of ethics  ,\" says Marc Bekoff, an animal behavior expert at the University of Colorado. \" If I don't play in a certain way, you won't play with me. Some animals have the same code.\"\n     Scientists recently discovered that animals that live in groups, such as elephants, foxes, and wolves, are especially likely to follow rules. If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over. His body language meant, \" Don't leave, I'll play nicely.\" The female gave him another chance, and the male wrestled more gently this time."

      "A rainforest is an area covered by tall trees with the total high rainfall spreading quite equally through the year and the temperature rarely dipping below l6degC. Rainforests have a great effect on the world environment because they can take in heat from the sun and adjust the climate. Without the forest cover,these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere, warming the rest of the world. Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns,potentially causing certain natural disasters all over the world.\nIn the past hundred years,humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources : land for crops,wood for paper and other products,land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit.\nThere are two main reasons for _ . Firstly,when people cut down trees,generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly,cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now,but in the long run it actually reduces the world's wood supply.\nRainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests. However,fewer than l%of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value. It is extremely likely that our best chance to cure diseases lies somewhere in the world's shrinking   rainforests."

      "Microblogging is a broadcast medium in the form of blogging. A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically much smaller, in both actual size and aggregate file size. Microblogs \"allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links\".\nAs with traditional blogging, microbloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as \"what I'm doing right now,\" to the thematic , such as \"sports cars.\" Commercial microblogs also exist, to promote   websites, services and/or products, and to promote collaboration within an organization.\nSome microblogging services offer features such as privacy settings, which allow users to control who can read their microblogs, or other ways of publishing rights besides entering the web-based interface.  These may include text messaging, E-mail, or digital audio.\nThe first microblogs were known as tumblelogs. The term was invented in a blog post on April 12, 2005. However, by 2006 and 2007, the term microblog came into greater usage for such services provided by Tumbler and Twitter. Other leading social networking websites Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and XING also have their own microblogging features, better known as status updates.\nSeveral studies, especially by Harvard Business School have tried to analyze the usage behavior of Microblogging services. Many of these studies show that for services such as Twitter, there is a small group of active users contributing to most of the activity.\nTwitter, Facebook and other microblogging services are also becoming a platform for marketing and public relations, with a sharp growth in the number of social media marketers. The Sysomos study shows that this specific group of marketers on Twitter is much more active than general user population, with 15% following more than 2,000 people."

      "Jack Benny was one of the most famous names in show business.He was born in Chicago,Illinois,on February 14th,1894.His parents,Meyer and Emma Kubelsky,were religious Jews.They had moved to the United States from Eastern Europe.Benny was a quiet boy.For much of the time,his parents were busy working in his father's store.As a child,Benny learned to play the violin.After finishing his school,he joined the Navy.He continued using his violin to perform for sailors.In one show he was chosen more for his funny jokes than for his skill with the violin.That experience made him believe that his future job was a comedian.\nBenny developed a show personality that had all the qualities people dislike.He was known for being so _ --he refused to spend any money unless forced to do so.On his shows Benny often spoke of his appearance,especially his baby blue eyes.As he grew older,he always claimed to be 39 years old.Benny rarely made jokes that hurt other people.Instead,he would let the other actors on the show tell jokes about him.\nIn real life,he was very giving and he was a person people liked having as their employer.Benny entered the new media of television in 1950.Five years later,he dropped his radio programme to spend more time developing his television show.At first his appearances on television were rare.By 1960 the Benny Show was a weekly television programme.It continued until 1965.Benny appeared in about twenty films during his life.A few became popular.But most were not.In 1963 Benny returned to Broadway for the first time since 1931.\nBenny received many awards during his lifetime.Perhaps the one honour that pleased him most was that his hometown of Waukeegan named a school for him.This was a special honour for a man who had never finished high school.\nBenny continued to perform.He died of cancer in 1974.At his funeral his friend Bob Hope said,\"Jack Benny was stingy to the end.He gave us only eighty years.\""

      "A recent study, published in last week's Journal of the American Medical Association, offers a picture of how risky  it is to get a lift from a teenage driver. Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a deadly accident as a teenager driving alone, while the risk of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional passenger.\nThe authors also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased sharply after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late-night accident.\nRobert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. \"The basic issue,\" he says, \"is that adults who are responsible for issuing licenses fail to recognize how complex and skilled a task driving is.\"\nBoth he and the author of the study believe that the way to mitigate (......)the problem is to have states set up so-called graduated licensing systems, in which getting a license is a multistage process. A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove himself capable of driving in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with night or passenger limits, before graduating to full driving licenses.\nGraduated licensing systems have reduced teenage driver crashes, according to recent studies. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place, but only 10 of those states have limits on passengers. California is the strictest, with a new driver under 20 forbidden to carry any passenger (without the presence of an adult over 25) for the first six months."

      "Many kids don't drink enough water daily, according to a new study. The study's lead author, Erica Kenney, at first planned to look into the amount of sugary drinks kids were drinking in schools. However, during her research she found that many kids were simply not drinking enough water.\nKenney and her team examined data from a group of 4,000 children, aged 6 to19, between the years of 2009 and 2012. The data was taken from the National Health and Nutrition Survey,a study on the health of children in the United States conducted each year by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention..\nWhile looking through the survey results, she noticed that more than half of the kids who took part in the study were dehydrated  . Of' that group, boys were 76% more likely than girls not to have enough water in their system. Nearly one quarter of the kids in the survey reported drinking no plain water at all.\n\"These findings highlight  a possible health issue that wasn't given a lot of attention in the past,\" Kenney said in a statement. \"Even though for most of these kids this is not an immediate and great health threat, this is an issue that could really be reducing quality of life and well-being for many children and youth.\"\nThe United States-National Agriculture Library says average kids need between 10 to 14 cups of water every day. This water can come from a mix of drinks and foods that contain high amounts of water, such as celery, melons or tomatoes. It is also recommended that fluids come from water instead of sugary drinks that are high in calories and can lead to weight problems."

      "Elizabeth Mitchell's new \"Liberty's Torch\" is the fascinating story of how the Statue of Liberty came to be. The Statue of Liberty's rough history is explored in \"Liberty's Torch\".\nFrederic Auguste Bartholdi is an all-but-forgotten figure in American history. He was, however, responsible for one of the most enduring symbols of the United States: the Statue of Liberty. A Frenchman from Alsace, he designed and built the Statue of Liberty which stood on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor. How this statue came to be is the fascinating subject of Elizabeth Michell's new book \"Liberty's Torch\".\nThe power of Mitchell's narrative is convincing . We recognize the Statue of Liberty now as a symbol of hope and opportunity for a nation of immigrants. At the time, though, people could not see that-nor did they even imagine that. Instead, the construction of the statue was born of one man's desire to set up a great monument.\nFor this reason, perhaps, \"Liberty's Torch\" relies on Bartholdi as the connecting thread. Bartholdi went to Egypt to make photographic copies of the main monuments. On the boat, Bartholdi met and began a lifelong relationship with Ferdinand de Lesseps, the man who would build the Suez Canal. Maybe it was this friendship, or maybe it was seeing Egypt's huge monuments, but finally the trip inspired Bartholdi's dream to create the largest statue ever built. Failure to bring this to completion in Egypt, followed by his exile   from Paris, led Bartholdi to sail to America.\nBy explaining the Statue of Liberty's hard history and showing Bartholdi's brave spirit, Mitchell has done a great service."

He is _ for news all the time, then after several years he may get a desk job, and life becomes a bit more settled. Let's look at his work a little more closely. In a day he may have to interview the prime minister of a foreign country, and the next day he may be writing about a football match. Sometimes he may be so busy that he has hardly any time to sleep. And at other times he may go on for days looking out for news materials yet return empty-handed.\nIn the beginning, a reporter has to cover a very wide field. After the early years he becomes more specialized in his work. For example, he may finally be asked to write only on court cases or politics or sports. Some reporters may become so specialized that they are asked only to write on a special thing: horse racing, for example. In most newspaper houses there is at least one special racing correspondent. Some newspapers have book reviews. Their job is delightful. They read the latest book and then write reviews on the ones they like. Then there are those who write on films, so they get to see them even before they are shown in the cinema. How lucky, you would say!\nA reporter's job can also be very dangerous. A number of them have died rushing from one assignment to another, and if there is a flood or a riot  they may get hurt or even be killed. Three years ago there was a reporter whose camera was smashed by a group of men, because they were angry with him for taking their picture.

      "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \""

      "Finally, I entered the university. Because of my careful savings, I                did not have to work during the school year. Then, summer came and it was time to work harder than ever.  I continued working as a waitress at night, instructed tennis camps several mornings a week and worked as a secretary for a few hours in the afternoons. I even decided to take a class at a community  college. This class at the community college saved me $650. It was an extremely tiring summer and made me anxious to return to my relatively easy life at the university.\nDuring my second and third years of undergraduate schooling, I decided to work about five hours per week in the campus   admissions office answering phones. This provided a little spending money and kept me from drawing my savings out. The overall situation looked hopeful as I approached my senior year as long as I could make as much money as I had the previous summer. I wanted to go to Israel to study for 3 weeks, but I hesitated in making this decision because it would cost me $1 600 more to get the credits in Israel. About two weeks later my Mom called to tell me that I had$1 600 in the bank that I had forgotten about! One of my concerns about this trip was not only the cost, but the loss of time to make money; however, I made as much that summer in the ten weeks when I was at home as I had made during the fourteen weeks when I was at home the summer before. The way everything worked together to make this trip possible was one of the most exciting things that have ever happened to me.\nThis experience has shaped me in many important ways. The first thing that I learned was the importance of a strong work ethic  . Working long hours did a lot to develop my character and helped me learn the value of a dollar. It also made me learn how to search for creative ways to settle difficult situations."

      "Ban Fur? Then Why Not Leather?\nMuch to the displeasure of some local businesses, the City Council in West Hollywood, California, voted without opposition last week to ban the sale of fur products. Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?\nAnimals Do Not Have Rights\nBy Tibor R. Machan\nMy view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies. If animals had such rights as human beings do, they would have to be held responsible for killing fellow animals in the wild. That way of thinking about animals makes a category mistake. Using animals, including their fur or organs, to improve people's lives is acceptable.\nA Small Step Against Cruelty\nBy Kate Carter\nBoth fur and leather are the skins of dead animals. Why should we think that the lovable furry ones deserve more of a life than the less pleasing ones? Some say leather is  less cruel because it's a byproduct   of the meat industry. But this isn't really true. Some cheap leather may be a byproduct of the meat industry, but often it's the other way round. In South Africa, where there is a developing market for ostrich farms, the skins account for roughly 80 percent of the slaughtered  birds' value, a mere 20 percent of which comes from the meat.\n\"Who\" Are You Wearing?\nBy Marc Bekoff\nWest Hollywood's ban is a move in the right direction. However, we must work to ban the sales of leather and hides, too. Furs come from animals who are attacked to become clothing, while some leather and hides come from slaughterhouse  animals. We must remember that when people choose to wear fur, leather and hides, they are wearing formering conscious beings. So it's a matter of who they are wearing, not what they are wearing because these animals must be referred to as who and not what or that."

      "NEW YORK--Microsoft on Monday made another effort to challenge Apple's iPhone and Google's Android in the exploding smartphone market--launching a wireless operating system,Windows Phone 7.\nConsumers will consider it\"always delightful and thoroughly mine,\"Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said at a launch event. Ballmer said last year that Microsoft had\" _ \"with its Windows Mobile operating system.For example,it failed to keep up with touch-screen innovations that make iPhones and Android phones easy to use.\nMicrosoft fell from third to fourth place in market share this year,behind BlackBerry,iPhone and Android. Only 10.8% of smartphone owners used Microsoft's system in August,down from 18% last December.\nBut Windows Phone 7 is\"a total departure from anything they've done\".Microsoft says it sought to simplify common activities. For example,you can instantly take a picture with a phone's camera by pushing a button on the device. You don't have to first awaken it from its sleep mode and launch the camera application. You also can program the phones to automatically upload photos to Facebook or other social network sites in a couple of seconds. Users can easily work with Microsoft Office contact and calendar information as well as documents created in Microsoft's Word,Excel and PowerPoint.\nThe phones will not show videos built on Adobe's Flash platform,widely used by services including YouTube and Hulu.\nAT&T will offer the first Windows Phone 7 smartphone,the Samsung Focus,on Nov.8.Soon after,it will have the LG Quantum and HTC Surround. Each will cost S|  199.99 with a two-year service contract. T-Mobile will have two Windows Phone 7 models out for the holiday shopping season:the HTC HD7 and Dell Venue Pro.

      "Cole Bettles had been rejected by a number of universities when he received an e-mail from the University of California, San Diego, last month, congratulating him on his admission and inviting him to tour the campus. His mother booked a hotel in San Diego, and the 18-year-old Ojai high school senior arranged for his grandfather, uncle and other family members to meet them at the campus for lunch during the Saturday tour.\n\"They were like 'Oh my God, that's so awesome  ', \" Bettles said. Right before he got in bed, he checked his e-mail one last time and found another message saying the school had made a mistake and his application had been denied.\nIn fact, all 28, 000 students turned away from UC San Diego, in one of the toughest college entrance seasons on record, had received the same incorrect message. The students' hopes had been raised and then dashed   in a cruel twist that shows the danger of instant communications in the Internet age.\nUCSD admissions director Mae Brown called it an \"administrative error\" but refused to say who had made the mistake, or if those responsible would be disciplined  . \nThe e-mail, which began, \"We're thrilled that you've been admitted to UC San Diego, and we're showcasing   our beautiful campus on Admit Day, \" was sent to the full 46, 000 students who had applied, instead of just the 18, 000 who got in, Brown said.\nThe error was discovered almost immediately by her staff, who sent an apology within hours.\n\"It was really thrilling for a few hours; now he's crushed  , \" said Cole's mother, Tracy Bettles. \"It's really tough on them.\"\nThe admissions director said she was in the office on Monday until midnight answering e-mails and phone calls from disappointed students and their parents.

      "People in Mutsuhito, Japan, lived through one hundreds, and sometimes thousands, a day.But they couldn't get used to it.\nWhat was it? It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!"

If you prefer offbeat places, check out the following roadside attractions.\nWorld's Largest Ball of Paint\nAlexandria, Ind. \nIn 1977, Michael Carmichael set out to create the biggest ball of paint anywhere. Starting with a baseball as centre, he painted layer by layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness World Record. Visitors can paint the wall themselves and become part of the history.\nThe Museum of Dirt\nBoston, Mass. \nThe museum is the idea of Glenn Johnson. Labeled   glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free.\nMount Horeb Mustard Museum \nMount Horeb, Wis. \nIt's heaven for hotdog lovers! This museum says it has to have the world's largest collection for prepared mustard . Its more than 4,100 bottles of spices  come from 60 nations, including Turkey and China. Visitors learn the history of mustard, from how it's made to how it's advertised and sold. The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much that he even puts it on ice-cream!\nPaper House\nRockport, Mass. \nSwedish immigrant  Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much---if any---thought to recycling paper. In fact, \"recycling\" wasn't even a word yet. The house is framed with wood, but the walls are made of 210 layers of newspaper. In all, he used about 100,000 newspapers."

      "I am sure that everybody in his/her life has used computers. Nowadays you can feel their presence everywhere at home,at school,at work and they certainly make life easier.On the other hand,there are people who can't work with them.\nAnyway,I believe their presence is a good thing. Life with them seems easier, less difficult and more comfortable You can use them to choose your meal,to withdraw your money, and also save your time,because these operations are all controlled by computers. Therefore you can hardly imagine the modern world without them;the whole planet seems to be one big computer society.\nNevertheless,problems can often appear in this area, too.To have a computer means you have to be quite well-off and have the necessary skills to use it.However,think about questions like \"Are computers so available for everyone, or rich and poor people,for people from villages and people from cities. Aren't they too expensive?Is everyone able to learn how to use them and not everyone has the chance to access and work with them,how could everything in the future be dependent on them?\"Therefore,I think our society will be split into two parts.One part will work with them and enjoy the benefits that computers can bring and the other part will be pushed out and will actually be far behind the other group.\nAnother question that bothers me is,on the one hand,computers are important  and good things in our life,but they aren't everything.They are good as a help at school,quite often as entertainment,especially for young people,as an necessary tool to help in research etc,but I think we shouldn't be so dependent on them,because computers are only machines and machines can't feel anything be human and sympathetic,and every action performed by computer can be interfered with another person,which could cause these machines to crash or work badly.\nIn conclusion,I would like to say I am not against computers.I use computers,too,but people should be wary all the time."

      "The British policeman has several nicknames, but the most frequently used are\"copper\"and\"bobby\". The first name comes from the verb \"cop\" meaning \"to take\" or \"capture\", and thesecond comes from the first name of Sir Robert Peel, a 19th century politician, who was the founder of the police force. An early nickname for the policeman was \"peeler\", but this name had died out.\nVisitors to England seem,nearly always, to be very impressed by the English police. In fact, it has become a joke that the visitors to Britain, when asked for his views of the country, will always say,at some point or other, \"I think your policemen are wonderful.\"\nWell, the British bobby may not always be wonderful but he is usually a very friendly and helpful character.\nA music-hall song of some years ago was called, \"If you want to know the time, ask a policeman.\" Nowadays, most people own watches but they still seem to find plenty of other questions to ask the policeman. In London, the policemen spend so much of their time directing visitors about the city that one wonders how they ever find time to do anything else!"

      "Since the 1950s, most of the stars of pop music have come from Britain and America. Howver, in the last ten years, when many different kinds of music have established themselves on the pop scene, more and more stars have come from other countries.\nPop music changes all the time and new stars appear and become famous. For a musician to stay popular and still produced good, original music over a long period of time, is a sign of true star.\nMost stars start their careers in a simple way---- playing in unknown night clubs or dance-hall where people want to dance to the music, not listen to it. They may have continued doing this for many years untill they get a \"break\"---- a chance to perform in a well -known place or get a recording contract. To become a star is the aim of every singer or musician and the dream of many a pop-crazy teenager.\nHowever a group or star makes it to the top, they can be sure that their lives will change once they are successful. Ordinary teenagers living at home with their parents may suddenly find themselves rich enough to buy their own houses. An established superstar may be able to buy several.\nDespite the large amount of money that are earned, life at the top is not easy for many stars.. The pop scene is hard work and many stars need to spend a lot of time away from home. For a lot of them, this means they have no home life and their personal relationships suffer. Despite great public success, life at the top can be very lonely."

      "Growing up in one of the poorest, most crime-ridden  communities on the south side of Atlanta, US, being raised by a single mother who didn't finish 3rd grade, living each day on food stamps  and attending what the media called \"the most dysfunctional  public school district,\" not many people expected much of me, so I had to expect something of myself.\nOn my 13th birthday, I bought a poster of Harvard to hang in my room. Being at Harvard became what I dreamt about: I saw myself attending class in Sanders Theater, studying in Widener Library and eating in Annenberg Hall. Even when my electricity was\ncut off and I woke up at 5:30 a.m. to pitch blackness, I knew that my poster of Harvard was still hanging only two feet away from me. I'd begin my day by asking myself these two questions, \"What do I want in my life?\" and \"Are the things I am doing today going to get me closer to that life?\"\nReminding myself of my goal each day made it easy to say no to the same choices I saw my peers making, because those paths wouldn't have gotten me closer to my goal. I found that even poverty could not take away my power to decide what I choose to do with\nmy day. Asking myself those questions gave me the courage to cold email about 50 Harvard students so I could ask for feedback  on my application essays; it gave me the energy to study just one more hour on my SATs when my friends were asleep; and it gave me the determination to submit  just one more scholarship application when 180 0thers had already turned me down.\nOn March 3 lst, 2011, an email arrived from Harvard. The first word was \"Congratulations!  \"A month later, Harvard flew me up to visit the campus where for the first time I got to see inside Sanders Theater, tour Widener Library and eat dinner in Annenberg Hall.\nWho you are today is the result of the decisions you made yesterday, and who you will be tomorrow will be the result of the choices you make today.

      "A weather system known as a polar vortex brought dangerously cold weather to large parts of the United States this week. A polar vortex is a cold, thick low pressure system. The air turns counter-clockwise when on the move.\nThe polar vortex started up in Canada. After crossing the border, it moved deep into the southeastern United States. The polar vortex brought the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years to many areas. Alice Jenkins lives in Washington D.C.\n\"I have a coat on. I have three sweaters. I have two blouses. But I don't feel like I have anything on.\"\nAnother woman, named Amanda, lives nearby in Maryland.\n\"It's D.C. It's not supposed to be this cold.\"\nThe extreme weather started with a low-pressure system near the North Pole. The Arctic air was pushed as far south as Alabama on wind currents known as the jet stream. The bitter cold covered much of the central United States, forcing schools, government offices and businesses to \nclose.\nBut the polar vortex did not have the same effect everywhere.\nInterestingly enough, it is warmer in Alaska and also somewhat warmer over Greenland because when you exhaust cold air in the North Pole and the Arctic region, when it's forced southward, it can't all stay there. Basically it's rushing towards us in the United States.\"\nCamden Walker, a weather expert, says the weather system moved away quickly from places like Washington. But the cold air and high winds were staying longer in the middle of the country.\nTemperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius or lower were reported in Washington, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In fact, temperatures in all or parts of the 50 states were below freezing at some point on Tuesday. Even in Hawaii, it was minus six degrees at the top of the state's highest mountain. \nThe effect of the polar vortex was extensive. Airline companies cancelled more than 11,000 flights over a four day period. The cold weather also interfered with train service. In the south, the Tennessee Valley Authority said it set a single day record for electricity as homeowners struggled to stay warm. But there was more to the picture."

      "People bury treasure to stop other people from taking it. They choose a quiet place, dig a deep hole and bury the treasure in it. Then they make a map of where the treasure is or write down other clues that will help them or someone else to find it again.\nIn Britain a few years ago, a writer wrote about some treasure that he had buried. He put clues in the story to help readers find it. Thousands of people hunted for the treasure. They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasured Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates   and later finds some buried treasure.\nThen there is the true story about a man who had to travel overseas for a year. He did not trust banks, so he buried his life savings in a park. Then he went away. On his return, he went straight to the park. But the park was no longer there. In its place there was a huge building.\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map.\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures."

      "A survey reveals that employees in China say they are not engaged in their jobs. Judging by the survey data, many Chinese workplaces are black holes of misery and despair.\nOnly 6% of Chinese employees said they are \"engaged\" in their jobs, according to a global Gallup survey released this month. China's numbers equal the numbers out of war-weary  Iraq.\nWorkers across all income levels and industries were surveyed by Gallup in China, defined by Gallup to mean they were \"psychologically committed to their jobs and likely to be making positive contributions to their organizations\".\nOut of 94 countries polled, only six countries scored lower rates of job engagement than China, including Tunisia, Israel and Syria. Unsurprisingly, 0% of Syrians admitted to being engaged at work.\nIn a related survey, China ranked near the bottom in a poll measuring job satisfaction among 22 Asian countries. Only 49% of Chinese respondents said they were happy in their jobs.\nPart of the problem, I suspect, is that very few in China have the _ to pursue a career that truly interests them.\nEven university graduates often feel they have no choice but to choose the positions with the government or state-run enterprises, since those jobs are thought to be stable.\nThat makes those who are happy at work in China a rare find indeed."

      "No one knows for certain why people dream, but some dreams misht be connected to the mental processes that help us learn. In a recent study, scientists found a connection between nap-time   dreams and better memory in people who were learning a new skill.\n\"I was astonished by this finding,\" Robert Stickgold told Science News. He is a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School who worked on the study of-how the brain and nervous system work, and cognitive studies look at how people learn and reason. So a cognitive neuroscientist may study the brain processes that help people learn.\nIn the study, 99 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 each spent an hour on a computer, trying to get through a virtual maze  . The maze was difficult, and the study participants had to start in a different place each time they tried - making it even more difficult. They were also told to find a particular picture of a tree and remember where it was.\nFor the first 90 minutes of a five-hour break, half of the particularity stayed awake and half were told to take a short nap. Participants who stayed awake were asked to describe their thoughts. Participants who took a nap were asked about their dreams before sleep and after steep - and they were awakened within a minute of sleep to describe their dreams.\nAbout a dozen of the 50 people who slept said their dreams were connected to the maze. Some dreamed about the music that had been playing when they were working; others said they dreamed about seeing people in the maze. When these people tried the computer maze again, they were generally able to find the tree faster than before their naps. However, people who had other dreams, or people who didn't take a nap, didn't show the same improvement.\nStickgold suggests the dream itself doesn't help a person learn - it's the other way around."

Google is saying how many sets of Glass will be available during the limited-time offer.\nThis version of Glass, though, still isn't the perfect product that Google hopes to sell in stores later this year.\nFor now, Google is still trying to recruit  more people willing to serve as volunteers for its attempt to build a wearable device that features some of the same feature as a smart phone. \" Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new view that is making Glass better,\" Google said.\nThe device has a small screen attached above the right eye. A user can check e-mails, see Twitter post or get directions without having to use a phone. It can also take hands-free photos and video through voice-activated  commands. The ability to record images so easily has raised safely concerns about drivers wearing Glass. The lawmakers have to draw up new rules forbidding use of the device in moving vehicles.\nGoogle regards Glass as a breakthrough .

These days, more teens volunteer than work for pay. Teens clean up parks, walk dogs at animal shelters , visit the elderly and more.\nSome cities ---- including Seatle, Chicago, and Washingtong,D.C. ----require high school students to volunteer.

      "Hair has always been an important sign of beauty, especially true for women.Next to the face, hair is one of the main qualities people look for when they consider a woman's beauty.Whether long or short, curly or straight, hair often gets a lot of attention.\nEach hair grows independently of other hairs.Not all hairs experience the same period of growth at the same time.During the period of active growth, which is called Anagen, hair grows at a rate of about or one centimeter a month.About eighty five percent of hair follicles  are going through this process at any given time.This period can last from two to six years.\nThe Catagen period of hair growth comes next.It is then that hair growth begins to slow down.This period usually lasts two or three weeks.Finally, hair growth comes to a complete stop and the hairs begin to fall out.This period is known as Telogen.Once the Telogen period has ended, the hair growth process begins again.\nSo what happens when a person has trouble growing hair or suffers from hair loss? Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person.\nHowever, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period.\nYour health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice."

      "A woman wears a face mask to protect her from polluted air in prefix = st1 /Lanzhou,China, in December.\nA new study showed air pollution might put people more at risk for heart disease than scientists had thought. Kristin Miller, a doctoral student at the UniversityofWashington, said chances of getting the disease were related to not only which city a woman lived in, but also where in the city. The study found that the effects of air pollution were often larger within cities than between cities.\nThe new findings make experts suspect that current pollution limits may be inadequate. Scientists examined rates of heart attack, stroke   and other cardiovascular   events in women with long-term exposure to air pollution.\nThe study involved women over the age of fifty who had no sign of cardiovascular disease at the start of the research. The study followed the women for as long as nine years to see how they would develop cardiovascular problems.\nThe researchers also examined levels of fine particles (,) in the air in 36 areas across the country. That information came from the Environmental Protection Agency. The extremely small particles came from industrial smoke and traffic, along with things like wood-burning fireplaces in houses.\nIn the study, every ten-microgram increase in the risk of a cardiovascular event. But it was related to a seventy-six percent increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\nBut just how do particles in the air damage the cardiovascular system? The particles may cause the lungs to swell and release chemicals from the pollutants into the blood. The chemicals then could damage the heart."

      "Today, whether or not you follow the latest trends, one's fashion and choice of dress is a reflection of one's individual style and tastes. Can you still remember how you dressed at the start of China's opening-up? Today's program is one of a special series commemorating   the 30th anniversary of reform and opening-up in China. In these two episodes we focused on fashion and style and were honored to invite two special guests to join us in studio--Ms. Zhang Ling from Raffles-BICT Inter-national College and Alex from Esquire magazine.\nWhen we talk about fashion, color is absolutely crucial. A color can reflect the mood of an individual person or the spiritual temperament  of entire society or age. Mrs. Zhang and Alex talked about the colors which have left the greatest impression on them. In the 1960s and 70s, blue and grey were the dominant colors at the time and people had limited choices to dress up. But fast forward to the present, you will find no difficulty in choosing from array  of vivid colors in the market.\nWe also gave our guests a list of keywords--traditional brands, jeans, DIY, international brands, personal dress for them to choose from in order to represent the fashion of their generation. We find out that for every keyword our guest chose, there was a special story behind it. Some of the stories brought us back to old times--we even brought some vintage  clothing from the 60s and 70s up on stage and invited some audience members to try them on.\nWhen we mention fashion, we must mention brand. With increasing disposable  income and purchasing power of the Chinese, many luxury brands have flocked into China. However, you could imagine in 1980s, when the first inter-national brand came to China, it unveiled  a fashion storm among the Chinese."

      "I still remember my first day at school in London and I was half-excited and half-frightened. On my way to school I wondered what sort of questions the other boys would ask me and practiced all the answers: \"I am nine years old. I was born here but I haven't lived here since I was two. I was living in Farley. It's about thirty miles away. I came back to London two months ago.\" I also wondered if it was the custom for boys to fight strangers like me, but I was tall for my age. I hoped they would decide not to risk it.\nNo one took any notice of me before school. I stood in the center of the playground, expecting someone to say \"hello\", but no one spoke to me. When a teacher called my name and told me where my classroom was, one or two boys looked at me but that was all.\nMy teacher was called Mr. Jones. There were 42 boys in the class, so _ , either, until the first lesson of the afternoon. Mr. Jones was very fond of Charles Dickens and he had decided to read aloud to us from David Copperfield, but first he asked several boys if they knew Dickens' birthplace, but no one guessed right. A boy called Brian, the biggest in the class, said: \"Timbuktu\", and Mr. Jones went red in the face. Then he asked me. I said: \"Portsmouth\", and everyone stared at me because Mr. Jones said I was right. This didn't make me very popular, of course.\n\"He thinks he's clever,\" I heard Brian say.\nAfter that, we went out to the playground to play football. I was in Brian's team, and he obviously had Dickens in mind because he told me to go in goal. No one ever wanted to be the goalkeeper.\n\"He's big enough and useless enough.\" Brian said when someone asked him why he had chosen me.\nI suppose Mr. Jones, who served as the judge, remembered Dickens, too, because when the game was nearly over, Brian pushed one of the players on the other team, and he gave them a penalty  . As the boy kicked the ball to my right, I threw myself down instinctively   and saved it. All my team crowded round me. My bare knees were injured and bleeding. Brian took out a handkerchief and offered it to me.\n\"Do you want to join my gang  ?\" he said.\nAt the end of the day, I was no longer a stranger."

      "I was brought up in the British, _ . Strong feelings aren't something you display in public. So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already. We needed a break."

      "Computer power is moving into the \"cloud\"--networks of data centres that use the Internet to supply all kinds of services, from e-mail and social networks to data storage and analysis.\nThe rise of cloud computing is rapid and causing huge changes in the tech industry. The old guard is suffering: this week's $67 billion merger   between Dell and EMC, makers of computers and storage devices respectively  , was a marriage forced by the rise of the cloud. Disruptive   newcomers are blooming: if Amazon's cloud-computing unit were a stand-alone public company, it would probably be worth almost as much as Dell and EMC combined.\nThe gains for customers have been equally dramatic. Compared with older IT systems, cloud computing is often much cheaper. It adds tremendous flexibility: firms that need more computing capacity no longer have to spend weeks adding new servers and installing software. In the cloud they can get hold of it in minutes. Their applications can be updated continually, rather than just every few months. Individual users can reach their e-mails, files and photos from any device. And cloud services also tend to be more secure, since providers know better than their customers how to protect their computing systems against hackers.\nBut cloud computing makes one problem worse. In the old IT world, once a firm or a consumer had decided on an operating system or database, it was difficult and costly to switch to another. In the cloud this \"lock-in\" is even worse. Cloud providers go to great lengths to make it easy to upload data. They accumulate huge amounts of complex information, which cannot easily be moved to an alternative provider.\nCloud firms also create a world of interconnected services, software and devices, which is convenient but only for as long as you don't venture   outside their universe. Being locked in to a provider is risky. Firms can start to tighten the screws by increasing prices. If a cloud provider goes bust  , its customers may have trouble getting back their data.\nThese risks have already caused a debate about whether the cloud needs stricter regulation. Some European politicians want to force cloud providers to ensure that data can be moved between them. That is too heavy-handed, because strict rules will inhibit   innovation in what is still a young industry. The history of computing suggests that common standards may well appear naturally in response to customers' demands--just as in personal computers, where it is now much easier to use the same files on different systems.\nIn the meantime, a few commonsense measures can reduce the risk of lock-in. Firms that use more than one cloud provider to host their data are less affected. So are those that keep their most important information in their own data centres. Consumers can take precautions, too. Some services are better than others at enabling users to move data between providers (Google does well on this score). Cloud computing promises its users many benefits, but don't mistake it for some sort of digital heaven."

      "When Caleb Forbes got his first job at an advertising company at the age of 20, he thought he would be at the company for years. But after seven months he was bored. Soon after that, Forbes moved to London. He took four different jobs at three companies over the next five years. Forbes wanted a better job and higher pay---he was never quite satisfied.\nWelcome to the world of a job hopper. Forbes's story isn't unusual these days and such frequent movement from one job to the next will become more common. The main reason: the nature of employment is changing. There are a lot more contracts and part-time jobs or flexible employment. That leads to people having a greater number of jobs. What's more, layoffs  and pay freezes , among other things, have pushed people from one job to another. In some cases, a bad worldwide job market has limited opportunities for star employees, promoting them to seek new challenges at other companies.\nHowever, employers often think that if a person jumped from his last employer after a short period, he will likely do the same again --- there is a significant financial risk in hiring someone who leaves in short order.\nWhat's more, moving from company to company frequently doesn't mean workers are climbing the corporate ladder  faster. In 2005, Monika Hamori, a professor at Spain's IE Business School, looked at CEOs at about 55 to see if those who moved around more frequently climbed the ladder faster.\nShe found that executives who stayed with one company became CEOs after 23 years, while executives who changed companies many times became CEOs after 26 years. One reason: workers within the same organization tend to be promoted more frequently and be offered better jobs."

      "Talking plants might sound like characters in a fairy tale. But recent scientific studies have shown that plants communicate with each other and with other living things in a surprising number of ways. To understand them, scientists say, we just have to learn their language. Farmers are especially interested in what plants have to say.\n\"Plants are able to communicate with all sorts of organisms  . They can communicate with giant bacteria, with other plants and with insects. They do this chemically,\" said Cahill, an Ecology Professor of the University of Alberta in Canada.\nPlant scientists are just beginning to understand this chemical \"language\". Cahill says studies have shown, for example, that plants can evaluate   conditions in their immediate environment and take appropriate actions.  Plants have an ability, for example, to signal pain or discomfort caused by anything from temperature extremes to an insect attack. Jack Schultz, a professor of chemical ecology at the University of Missouri, says when a plant senses that it's being eaten, it cannot walk away from trouble; on the contrary, it will release a chemical vapor  that _ other plants nearby.\n\"Their language is a chemical language, and it involves chemicals that move through the air that are easy to be changeable, and most of all are smells that we are familiar with,\" Schultz explained.\n\"All plants responded to the attack by changing their chemistry to defend themselves,\" Schultz recalled. \"But we were quite surprised to find that nearby plants also changed their chemistry to defend themselves, even though they were not part of the experiment.\"\nStudies have also shown that plants under attack release pleasant chemicals. Those chemicals attract friendly insects that attack the pests eating the plant.\nIn the end, plants' ability to communicate their needs--and our ability to understand them--could help farmers reduce the use of poisonous chemicals, cut operating costs and limit damage to the environment."

      "People can be addicted to  different things -- e.g. alcohol, drug, certain foods, or even television. People who have such an addiction are compulsive :They have a very powerful psychological need that they feel they must satisfy. According to psychologists, many people are compulsive spenders. They feel that they must spend money. This compulsion, like most others, is impossible to explain reasonably. For compulsive spenders who buy on credit , charge accounts are even more exciting than money. In other words, compulsive spenders feel that with credit, they can do anything. Their pleasure in spending large amounts is actually greater than the pleasure that they get from the things they buy.\nThere is even a special psychology of bargain hunting. To save money, of course, most people look for sales, low prices, and discounts. Compulsive bargain hunters, however, often buy things that they don't need just because they are cheap. They want to believe that they are helping their budgets , but they are really playing an exciting game. When they can buy something for less than other people, they feel that they are winning. Most people, experts claim, have two reasons for their behavior: a good reason for the things that they do and the real reason.\nIt is not only scientists, of course, who understand the psychology of spending habits, but also business people. Stores, companies, and advertisers use psychology to increase business. They consider people's needs for love, power, or influence, their basic values, their beliefs and opinions, and so on in their advertising and sales methods. Psychologists often use a method called \"behavior therapy \" to help individuals solve their personality problems. In the same way, they can help people who feel that they have problems with money."

      "Some children are natural-born bosses. They have a strong need to make decisions, manage their environment, and lead rather than follow. Stephen Jackson, a Year One student, \"operates under the theory of what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine,\" says his mother. \"The other day I bought two new Star Wars light sabers . Later, I saw Stephen with the two new ones while his brother was using the beat-up ones. \"\n\"Examine the extended family, and you'll probably find a bossy grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin in every generation. It's an inheritable trait,\" says Russell Barkley, a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. Other children who may not be particularly bossy can gradually gain dominance when they sense their parents are weak, hesitant, or in disagreement with each other.\nWhether it's inborn nature or developed character at work, too much control in the hands of the young isn't healthy for children or the family, Fear is at the root of a lot of bossy behavior, says family psychologist John Taylor. Children, he says in his book From Defiance to Cooperation, \"have secret feelings of weakness\" and \"a desire to feel safe. \" It's the parents' role to provide that protection.\nWhen a \"boss child\" doesn't learn limits at home, the stage is set for a host of troubles outside the family. The overly willful and unbending child may have trouble obeying teachers or coaches, for example, or trouble keeping friends. It can be pretty lonely as the top dog if no one likes your bossy ways.\n\"I see more and more parents giving up their power,\" says Barkley, who has studied bossy behavior for more than 30 years. \"They bend too far because they don't want to be as strict as their own parents were. But they also feel less confident about their parenting skills. Their kids, in turn, feel more anxious. \""

      "Chinese New Year celebrations, also known as the Spring Festival start on the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month of the Chinese calendar, and end on the 15th day of the first lunar month in the following year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese New Year's Day's date is calculated according to the Chinese lunar calendar. In 2015 it's Thursday, February 19.\nMany people clean their homes to welcome the Spring Festival. They put up the red posters with poetic verses on it to their doors, Chinese New Year pictures on their walls, and decorate their homes with red lanterns. It is also a time to reunite with  s so many people visit their families at this time of the year.\nIn the evening of the Spring Festival Eve, many people set off fireworks and firecrackers, hoping to cast away any bad luck and bring forth good luck. Children often receive lucky money. Many people wear new clothes and send Chinese New Year greetings to each other. Various activities such as beating drums and striking gongs, as well as dragon and lion dances, are all part of the Spring Festival festivities.\nThe Spring Festival is a national holiday in China. Government offices, schools, universities and many companies are closed during the period from the Spring Festival Eve to the seventh day of the first lunar month in the Chinese calendar. However, some enterprises such as banks often arrange for workers to be on shift duty. Public transport is available during the Chinese New Year period.\nThe red posters with poetic verses on it were initially a type of amulet  , but now it simply means good fortune and joy. Various Chinese New Year symbols express different meanings. For example, an image of a fish symbolizes \"having more than one needs every year\". A firecracker symbolizes \"good luck in the coming year\". The festival lanterns symbolize \"pursuing the bright and the beautiful\"."

      "The vast jungles of the Amazon rainforest are home to tribes mostly isolated from the outside world,whose way of life,largely unchanged for hundreds of years,is now increasingly threatened by modern civilization.\nNow, scientists discover they can monitor these\"uncontacted tribes\"using satellites,which would allow inexpensive and safe tracking of these tribes in order to protect them from outside threats.\nIn order to help conserve these uncontacted Indians,researchers need accurate estimates of their populations.One way to collect this data involves flying over their villages,but such overflights are both expensive and could fill these native peoples with fear.Another strategy involves meeting individuals on the ground,but among other risks,scientists could accidentally spread disease to members of the tribes.\nInstead,scientists investigated whether satellite imaging could monitor uncontacted tribes. The result was inspiring.They confirmed their locations and measured the sizes of their Village,houses and gardens.\"We can find isolated vinages with remote sensing and study them over time.\"Walker told Live Science.\"We can ask:Are they growing?Do they move?\"\nSurprisingly,based on the sizes of the houses and Villages,the scientists find the population densities of these isolated villages are about 10 times greater,on average,than other villages of native Brazilian peoples.This may be due to the fact that they have to live closer together because they are not as good at clearing the forest,since they lack modern devices like chainsaws and tractors,the researchers said.The tribes may also be afraid of spreading out due to fear of being attacked by outsiders,Walker said.\nThe researchers now plan to focus on 29 more isolated villages to\"look at their ecology--that is.distance from rivers and roads--and use this to model where else we can find more isolated villages,\"Walker said."

      "Sons who have fond childhood memories of their fathers are more likely to be emotionally stable in the face of day-to-day stresses, according to psychologists who studied hundreds of adults of all ages. \"As our study shows, fathers do play a unique and important role in the mental health of their children much later in life,\" psychology professor Melanie Mallers of California State University said.\n              For this study, 912 adult men and women between the ages of 25 and 74 completed short daily telephone interviews about that day's experiences over an eight-day period. The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.\n              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\" and \"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\" The same questions were asked about fathers.\n              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers. Men who reported having a good relationship with their fathers during childhood were more likely to be less emotional when reacting to stressful events in their current daily lives than those who had a poor relationship, according to her findings.\n              Also, the quality of mother and father relationships was significantly associated with how many stressful events the participants faced on a daily basis. In other words, if they had a poor childhood relationship with both parents, they reported more stressful incidents over the eight-day study when compared to those who had a good relationship with their parents.\n              Mallers explained why healthy or unhealthy relationships may have an effect on how people handle stress as adults. \"Perhaps having caring parents equips children with the experiences and skills necessary to more successfully navigate their relationships with other people throughout childhood and into adulthood,\" she said."

      "Dear Santa Claus,\nMy name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy. I just want one day when no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.\nLove,\nAmy\nAt radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully.  He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.\nThe next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the \"News Sentinel\". The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television stations reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable, Christmas gift--just one day without teasing.\nSuddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other.\nMany people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high.\nAmy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at  South Wayne High School. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.\nThat year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson. \"Everyone, \"said the mayor, \"wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth. \""

      "Some nations think they must have more and more babies, more and more people, if they are to remain strong and free.\nActually, this is not so. Very often in history, small nations have conquered large ones. It's not so much the size of the army as its organization and the technical level of its weapons. Thus, Greece took over Persia in the 300s B.C., Great Britain took over India in the 1700s, even though Persia and India had far bigger population than Greece and Great Britain.\nIf a nation wishes to avoid being dominated by its neighbors, its best chance is to raise its standard of living and its level of technology. _ can be done best by not allowing its population to grow to such a point that it is sunk in misery and poverty. In fact, the worst way in which a nation can try to avoid being dominated by its neighbor is to increase its population to the point of misery and poverty.\nIf every nation tries to compete with its neighbors by raising its population, then the whole world will be sunk in misery and poverty. The nations will become weak in a disaster that will leave nothing behind that is worth dominating. No one will have gained anything. Everyone will have lost everything.\nOnce all this is understood, and people generally agree that population growth must not be allowed to continue, they must also come to understand how that growth can be stopped. Population grows because more people are being born than are dying. There are two ways, then, in which the growth can be stopped. You can increase the number of people who die until it matches the number of people who are being born. Or else you can decrease the number of people who are born until it matches the number of people who are dying.\nThe first method--increasing the death rate--is the usual way in which population is controlled in all species of living things other than ourselves, but we don't want that, for disaster lies that way. The intelligent way is to reduce the birth rate. But how can the birth rate be reduced?"

      "My friend Mike was shaking his head in disbelief. \"That young woman who just waited on me,\" he said, pointing to an employee of the fast food restaurant where we were eating, \"had to call someone over to help her count change. The cash register   showed her I needed 99 cents, but she couldn't figure out how to count out the coins.\" I understood Mike's concern. What we have done is to create several generations of individuals most of whom have no idea how to reason; how to do simple math; how to do research; or, finally, how to be creative . The reason for this is our overuse of information technology: video games, television, digital watches, calculators, and computers. Information technology feeds us information without requiring us to think about it and let us perform operations without understanding them.    \nIt is time we took a hard look at an educational system that only teaches our children how to push buttons. Our kids can't tell time if the clock has hands. They can use calculators, but cannot add, subtract , divide, or multiply. Video games have taken the place of active, imaginative play. Although most of them are technically educated, they choose not to read. They are so used to television and movies that they cannot use their imagination to stay interested in a book.    \n     Therefore, we must do something to help our children. If we don't, they will never learn how to solve problems. They will never learn even basic reasoning skills and will certainly not develop creativity. Instead of filling classrooms with electronics, let's concentrate on good old-fashioned literacy -- reading books. Students must see how things work and how processes lead to results, and they must also stretch their imagination."

      "College is a fresh start, and a chance to make new friends. These friends may become your lifelong friends, or the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Whether you are going to a nearby college or the university far away from home, you are likely to meet new people wherever you are. Here are some advice to help you make friends at college.\nClearly, your classmates are all possible friends! Get to class early on the first day, and if you get there early enough, you will be in the room, or waiting outside it, with one other person, or a small group. A good casual opener would be to ask if you're in the right classroom, then introduce yourself, and explain that you're new, and a _ . Do this at all of your classes, and you will have a group of friends that you can make study groups with, take notes for you when you're absent or sick.\nIf you live in a dormitory, your hall will most likely have many fun activities to take part in. Take advantage ofthem, and go to as many as you can. Knowing your friends living in the same hall will also come in convenience because they will be the ones hosting and inviting you to parties that you will be missing out. Joining as many organizations as possible will also help you make new friends quickly. Parties are there to help students form close relationship with each other. Doing a team sport is another great idea. The best part of joining an organization is that you'll find people who share your interests, and with whom you'll therefore have a lot to talk about."

      "Signing up for a digital TV service provides you with access to over 200 channels from all over the globe. However, television today is dominated by adult language, making it hard for concerned families to find channels suitable for young eyes. Therefore, most movie channels are automatically removed form the list of TV channels for an entire family. The following are some good ones based on popularity on a global scale.\nDiscovery Channel\nDiscovery and its many channels can be considered as the founding father of informative channels on television. What National Geographic does in a scholastic  manner, Discovery tries to do in an entertaining manner--educating the masses about anything and everything.\nFox Family\nFinding a movie channel that broadcasts pictures suitable for teenagers and kids alike is very difficult unless your service operator offers you Fox family movies. This channel screens most movies before it broadcasts them, ensuring that no movie shows unacceptable material for young eyes.\nNickelodeon\nA channel very similar to Cartoon Network, it mostly shows US programs. However, their shows are sometimes a bit more mature for younger kids and better suited to kids aged 5 and up.\nABC Family\nABC started the ABC family channel in an attempt to introduce family-centered shows and serials to the public in the USA. The need for this channel was felt after ABC observed the lack of proper family type US channels.\nLiving\nIf travelling is a family hobby and better living is the motto then there is no better channel than Living. Kids can see never-seen-before sights, learning about new places while adults can practice their cooking and learn amazing things about motorbikes."

      "After the first World War, a small group of veterans   returned to their village in Britain. Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\""

      "\"Migrant workers\"  is a familiar term for 17-year-old Shi Jian. Her father and uncle often talk about the problems surrounding this group of people. However, Shi cares more about the children of these migrant workers.\nLast year Shi's housekeeper's daughter had to give up her schooling in Beijing because she would not be allowed to sit the national college entrance exam. She was forced to continue her high school education in her hometown in Sichuan Province.\nShi thinks the current law is unfair for migrant workers' children, as it prevents them from studying at public schools, unless their parents pay huge sums. So, Shi decided to do a survey of migrant workers so that she could find some solutions to help solve the problem.\nIn the last six months Shi spoke to 186 migrant workers in Beijing. Her interviewees include babysitters, guards, keepers, supermarket clerks, house cleaners and construction site workers. Shi found out that 55 of them were parents. Among this group, only eight have children who attend schools in Beijing. The other 47 had to leave children with relatives in the countryside. However, 40 of the 47 would like to enroll  their children in city schools.\nFrom her interviews, Shi found that the workers' lowest income was 400 yuan each month. Over one-third earn a monthly wage of or below 1000 yuan. \"Even schools for migrant workers' children charge more than public schools. Morever, parents constantly worry about these schools closing or relocating,\" she explained.\nShi has recently completed a report about her survey, in which she makes a series of recommendations. \"The government can set up public schools for migrants' children equal to schools for city children. Second, to offset  migrant workers' very low pay, public schools should offer them special rates so they can afford their children's tuition ."

      "Manage your time well for each module , but also make sure you get a good balance  between work and social life. That is\nfor life in general.\nSet aside time specifically for each subject. Try to study one subject a day. You need to balance time. If you are bad at balancing things, make a personal timetable. Even if you do not stick to it, you will have an idea what you should be doing each day. This is better than trying to do everything each day and, at the end of the week, not achieve anything. Also, try to keep your weekends free of studying. Only study at the weekend if you really have to.\nI had to learn to balance work, study and family when I was at college. I was a retail assistant working part-time and had at least four modules to complete at the same time at college. I also had to help around the house doing household cleaning and shopping at times. I managed to finish my college work on time, which was very difficult and hard, and still hold down a job.\nWhy was it possible? Because I only thought about my part-time work when I was at work on the weekends and my college work had to be done from Mondays to Fridays before the weekends. This was hard--but you need to set a timetable for yourself. It was an achievement when I finally realized that things have to be done in order, and need to be organized as well.\nBalancing study and other aspects  of your life can be a problem if you have a job or a family, but planning in advance is helpful. Use the time you have well. Do not leave anything until the last minute, as this will only cause problems."

      "In his 1930 essay \"Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren \", John Keynes, a famous economist, wrote that human needs fall into two classes: absolute needs ,which are independent of what others have , and relative needs ,which make us feel superior to our fellows. He thought that although relative needs may indeed be insatiable   , this is not true of absolute needs.\nKeynes was surely correct that only a small part of total spending is decided by the desire for superiority. He was greatly mistaken, however, in seeing this desire as the only source of insatiable demands.\nDecisions to spend are also driven by ideas of quality which can influence the demands for almost all goods, including even basic goods like food. When a couple goes out for an anniversary dinner, for example, the thought of feeling superior to others probably never comes to them. Their goal is to share a special meal that stands out from other meals.\nThere are no obvious limits to the _ of demand for quality. For example, Porsche, a famous car producer, has a model which was considered perhaps the best sport car on the market Priced at over $120,000, it handles perfectly well and has great speed acceleration. But in 2004, the producer introduced some changes which made the model slightly better in handling and acceleration. People who really care about cars find these small improvements exciting. To get them, however, they must pay almost four times the price.\nBy placing the desire to be superior to others at the heart of his description of insatiable demands, Keynes actually reduced such demands. However, the desire for higher quality has no natural limits."

      "As shocking as the idea of baby birds growing up in a cigarette-filled home sounds, a new study suggests that some birds may benefit from putting the stuff from cigarette butts   into their nests. The nicotine remaining in smoked filters   may serve as a natural insecticide  , driving harmful insects away from the nests and the baby birds living within. Tobacco plants produce nicotine because it defends against insects that would otherwise eat the plants.\n              The butts are undoubtedly smelly. But birds are actually quite fond of smelly chemicals, such as those found in aromatic   plants. Some nest-building species regularly fill their nests with fresh aromatics, possibly because the chemicals are good for the immune system or the development of the chicks. Alternatively, the plant chemicals might act as insecticides.\n              In the study, researchers at the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala in Mexico set up heat traps, which attract harmful insects, in 55 nests around Mexico City. Some traps were lined with the stuff in smoked cigarette filters. The others were lined with the stuff from unsmoked cigarette filters, which did not contain nicotine and other smoking by-products. Whether the nest held eggs, chicks or nothing, the unsmoked cigarette traps collected more harmful insects, suggesting that it is the chemicals that drove harmful insects away.\n              In a second experiment, the researchers collected 28 house sparrow nests and 29 house finch   nests from Mexico City immediately after the chicks flew out for food. They found that the more smoked filter stuff filled a nest, the fewer harmful insects it had.\n              The missing piece of the puzzle is whether the reduced number of harmful insects in the nests actually provided any benefit to the chicks. It is also unclear if nicotine or another chemical found in cigarettes may have turned the harmful insects out of the nests.\n              If the results hold, then this study is an example of wildlife adaptation to urbanization - or at least evidence that birds are smart and can still follow their noses in urban environments."

      "A rare butterfly has been discovered in Britain for the first time in 60 years,having moved from Eastern Europe.The only previous record of a wild yellow-legged Tortoiseshell in Britain was in 1953,when it was seen just once in Sevenoaks,Kent.Several weeks ago,there were already four confirmed sightings,along the East coast in Norfolk,Suffolk and Kent,and six further reports of the butterfly in coastal areas. Conservationists are very excited about the    sightings,which are rare in the butterfly world.\nThe butterflies are thought to have flown on easterly winds across Europe in the last few weeks.The large and colourful insect mainly lives in Eastern Europe.In recent years,it has spread into Scandinavia and its number increases rapidly during warm weather.Also known as the Scarce Tortoiseshell,it has an orange and blue colour and is about one third bigger than our own Small Tortoiseshell.\nButterfly Conservation was starting its annual Big Butterfly Count,a yearly survey of the butterflies across the nation.Sir David Attenborough,President of the charity,said,\"The UK is a nation of amateur naturalists and we have a proud tradition of celebrating and studying our wildlife.By taking part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer,you can contribute to discovering the fantastic butterflies and other wildlife that share your garden,parks and    countryside.\"He added,\"Butterflies fought back last year after a terrible 2012 but despite this,butterfly numbers were still below average.Three quarters of the UK's butterflies are in decline and one third are in danger of dying out.This is bad news for the UK's birds,bees,bats and other wildlife."

      "Travel can be a lifesaver. But in today's economy   with airlines adding new fees almost daily and ticket prices sharply on the rise, many have written off travel as too expensive. However, with a few saving tricks and a little research, there are still lots of great deals to be had on airline tickets and more.\nEarly Bird Gets the Deal.\nTravel experts say that there are certain times of day when more deals are available. Airfares can change three times a day as airlines adjust their prices to fill up flights. Early morning is when the fares tend to be lowest.www.zxxk.com\nWhat Wouldn't a Business Traveler do?\nFlying when business travelers don't can save you big money. Most business travelers fly on Mondays and Fridays, so Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days. Airlines will usually lower their prices on these days to aggressively try and fill empty seats.\n _ \n _ \nFly to popular places at unpopular times. The slowest time of the year for travel is in the Fall between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Again, to try and fill more empty seats, the airlines will lower prices and offer better deals to get people to fly during this time of the year.\nPackage Deals\nMany times the best deals on airfare can be found as part of a package rate. Most travel sites have package rates available. Often, the entire package (hotel, airfare, rental car) is cheaper than just the plane ticket on another site. Even if you don't need the rental car, with the money you've saved on the flight, you can afford to take a taxi. These deals are especially good on last minute bookings.\nWith a little inside knowledge and some good timing, you can get yourself a steal on a ticket to the vacation you thought was out of reach."

      "Two new studies have investigated why fewer women, compared to men, study and work in the so-called STEM subjects in the United States: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nThe American Association of University Women(AAUW) examined existing research. Its report \"Why So Few?\" suggested ways to interest more girls and women in the STEM fields. The researchers found that cultural and environmental factors make a difference.\nResearcher Christianne Corbett says more boys than girls score very high on math tests in most countries, but Iceland and Thailand are exceptions. \"This is something that we point out in our report--that cultural factors and societal factors can make a difference in who achieves at the very high levels and whether girls are achieving or not.\"\nAnother study carried out by the Campos Company for the Bayer Corporation in the United States asked more than 1,000 women and minority members of the American Chemical Society about their experiences.77% said not enough women and minorities are working in STEM today, because they were not encouraged to study those subjects in school.\nThe study, producing results similar to the AAUW research showed there's still a lot of work to be done. \"They say their interest in science begins before the age of eleven. So we need programs that get in front of kids while they're young in elementary school.\"\nIncreasing diversity in professions leads to better products, better science. And developing this science and engineering workforce is important to the nation's economic development.\n\"No matter what career you go into, whether it's accounting, human resources or science career, it's important that you can think creatively, you can work in teams, you can adapt to change and that's important for everybody,\" says Rebecca Lucore."

Worried shoppers rushed to stores and supermarkets in the country for salt, with the belief that it might protect them from potential nuclear radiation spreading from Japan.\n    Many rushed to buy to store as much iodized salt as possible because of the rumor that iodized salt could help prevent radiation poisoning spreading from Japan' s Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Consumers also worried that the nuclear plumes might spread  to China by air and sea, polluting food sources, including salt taken from the sea.\n The wave of panic buying spread quickly across the country, driving up salt prices by five to ten fold in some cities.\n Even regions rich in salt production, like Jiangxi Province,faced sudden shortages.\nThe government took measures to guarantee enough supply and to stabilize the market. It also dismissed the nuclear rumors, saying the nuclear fallout was unlikely to reach the country, and that salt did not help to prevent radiation poisoning.\n    Local authorities have stepped in to stabilize the market, too. As well, state-owned salt companies have been urged to increase their supply.\n Facing expanding market demand, distribution centers have taken extra measures to ensure they are well-prepared.\nWang Yun, the General Manager of Beijing Salt Industry Corporation, said, \"Our storage reserves can guarantee a two-month supply for the Beijing market.\""

      "Israel has passed a law banning the use of underweight models in advertising. Known as the \"Photoshop Law\", it also requires that agencies tell their audience if they've digitally changed pictures to make models look thinner.\nThe new law forbids the use of models with a body mass index of 18.5 or less, a standard based on internationally accepted measures. The figure matches the set of fixed limits by the U. S. Department of Health.\nThe law doesn't set a money amount that can be gained in court from such a _ . Lawmakers realize that it may be a long and difficult process to prove in court that a company broke the new law, but they feel that simply having the law in place will accomplish what they want; stopping advertising companies from continuing to influence Israelis with images of unhealthy-looking models as the gold standard of beauty.\nSome modeling agencies in Israel aren't happy. They say that the indexes on which the law is based are arbitrary  and are not suitable for every model. Many models who are totally healthy girls might be disqualified because of the law. Some models are naturally thin and unable to gain weight and the new law would unfairly prevent them from finding jobs.\nHowever, plus-size American supermodel Emme told CNN that she thinks the law will cause other countries to make similar measures against showing underweight models. \"I think this is fantastic because so many young women and men are suffering to look in a way that is unrealistic and unhealthy,\" she said."

      "Conventional wisdom is a major barrier to innovation that threatens the survival of companies everywhere.It's based on the assumption that old ideas will always work,so they shouldn't be challenged. While this may be a valid assumption in situations that don't change,it's unlikely to hold true in a changing situation.In today's rapid changing global environment,old methods often don't work,and stubbornly using them can lead to major problems.\nMost people seem to agree with conventional wisdom because it gives one a false sense of security.If everyone else believes it,then it must be true.Individuals who use conventional wisdom are certain that they are right,and being right is good. They want to continue using old ideas rather than take risks with changes that might not work.In 1977,Ken Olsen,co-founder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),stated \"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\" Despite being a dominant leader in the computer industry,DEC no longer exists.\nPeople seem to forget that since innovation is a change,there can be no innovation without change.Unfortunately,conventional wisdom prevents leaders,followers and companies from changing and therefore innovating.If companies don't innovate,but their competitors do,the future is likely to be problematic. Breaking from conventional wisdom has led to many of the most innovative companies and products in history across many industries,so it has a powerful effect on business success.\nTed Turner (founder of CNN) knew little,if anything,about the news business,but he knew it was inconvenient to watch news only at the dinner hour,as was common before CNN.Turner's solution was to create a cable channel dedicated to news 24 hours a day.The news establishment reflected conventional wisdom at the time,and predicted his idea would fail because no one wanted to watch the news all day.However,it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that viewers don't have to watch the news all day for the CNN to work.Viewers just have to watch when they want to get information.Due to conventional thinking,the critics failed to recognize the opportunity that was clear to Ted. They assumed that only what was familiar to them could work in the future.\nConventional wisdom prevents creativity,flexibility and risk-taking,so unconventional leaders enthusiastically break from it.To survive,thrive and maintain competitive advantage,companies must be flexible when reacting to change."

      "Amazingly, US crime figures have been falling for 20 years now. Of course, the big question is, why? And can any lessons be learnt?\n  One reason could be the fall in the demand for the drug crack. During the 1980s, drug-related crimes soared, mostly caused by desperate crack users. However, according to professor Blumstein, co-author of The Crime Drop in America, news of the dangers of crack use caused its decrease and led to a fall in the number of drug-related crimes.\n  Some say that the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy in many cities has helped lead to a fall in crime. In New York City, for example, mayor Rudy Giuliani imposed strict and automatic punishments for all crimes, including minor offences such as graffiti and littering. Many believe this has had a very strong deterrent  effect.\n  Another reason could be smarter policing strategies. Anti-theft measures and educating the community about car theft has helped see a drop in crimes in many areas. Also, the use of crime mapping schemes that can discover identify crime peaks in different parts of the city has helped police target hotspots.\n  Another reason could be that more criminals are now behind bars. Sociologist John Conklin (from Tufts University) says a significant factor behind the fall in crime in the 1990s is the simple fact that many criminals are in jail. In his book Why Crime Rages Fell, he says sentencing was merciful in the 1960s and 1970s, when crime rose. But then more prisons were built and more offenders were imprisoned.\n  Some have linked the fall in violent crime to a decline in children's exposure to lead in petrol. Jessica Wolpaw Reyes says, \"Even low to moderate levels of exposure can lead to behavioral problems, reduced IQ, hyperactivity  and youth crimes. You can link the decline in lead between 1975 and 1985 to a decline in violent crime 20 years later.\"\n  Others say that the drop in crime has something to do with birth rates. According to statistics, birth rates peaked between 1957 and 1961, and the proportion of men in the US in their late teens and early 20s (the so-called \"criminal age\") was highest in the late 70s and early 80s. However, as time went on, the proportion of people in this age group decreased. \n  Others claim that videogames have helped. A recent study has suggested that these games are keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime. Advocates of this argue that any effects the games may have in encouraging violent behavior is  _ by the fact that the games keep potential criminals indoors and in front of the television.\n  Some argue that the widespread use of camera phones makes some criminals think twice before committing a crime and getting filmed doing it. Also, many believe that the mass use of CCTV has also had an effect.\n  Finally, some say that petty theft just isn't worth it any more. The resale value of second-hand goods such as televisions, cameras or clothes is now so low (or even non-existent) that most people see no point in stealing. \n  So, what do you think?"

      "When I came to Cincinnati as an au pair  , a lot of things there were different from what I knew. My host family lived in a huge house I could only describe as a \"castle\".In Germany I had lived in a small apartment together with my mom. Soon I found out that the \"castle\" was actually rather small in our neighborhood.\nEverybody there was very friendly and polite. They greeted you when they were walking by at least 3 feet away from you. They must not have seen a German au pair before, for most people I met asked me all kinds of questions about Germany. I enjoyed answering their various strange questions. I made a lot of friends and I started to hang out with them.\nOf course, there were a number of new things, and it took me the whole year to find them all out. I never got homesick. Perhaps it was because I did not have too many negative experiences and felt loved and welcomed there.\nHowever, I had _ some painful experience back in Germany. I was frustrated by the way people would run me over and not even say \"Sorry.\" Taking up my studies at the TU-Dresden, I felt lonely. Everybody here seemed to be withdrawn  and I missed everything I had in Cincinnati. Germany was so \"cold\". I found it so much harder to make new friends. After six months I got a roommate and only two good friends. I also flew back to Cincinnati several times for long periods. I felt that without those visits I was not able to make it.\nNow I am over this German culture shock. It almost took me an entire year. I am still going back and forward between Dresden and Cincinnati four times a year."

      "The modern Olympic Games, founded in 1896, began as contests between individuals, rather than among nations, with the hope of promoting world peace through sportsmanship. In the beginning, the games were open only to amateurs. An amateur is a person whose involvement in an activity---from sports to science or the arts---is purely for pleasure. Amateurs, whatever their contributions to a field, expect to receive no form of compensation ; professionals, in contrast, perform their work in order to earn a living.\nFrom the perspective of many athletes, however, the Olympic playing field has been far from level. Restricting the Olympics to amateurs has precluded  the participation of many who could not afford to be unpaid. Countries have always desired to send their best athletes, not their wealthiest ones, to the Olympic Games.\nA slender and imprecise line separates what we call \"financial support\" from \"earning money.\" Do athletes \"earn money\" if they are reimbursed  for travel expenses? What if they are paid for time lost at work or if they accept free clothing from a manufacturer or if they teach sports for a living? The runner Eric Liddell was the son of poor missionaries; in 1924 the British Olympic Committee financed his trip to the Olympics, where he won a gold and a bronze medal. College scholarships and support from the United States Olympic Committee made it possible for American track stars Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph and speed skater Dan Jansen to train and compete. When the Soviet Union and its allies joined the games in 1952, the definition of amateur became still muddier. Their athletes did not have to balance jobs and training because as citizens in communist regimes, their government financial support was not considered payment for jobs.\nIn 1971 the International Olympic Committee(IOC) removed the word amateur from the rules, making it easier for athletes to find the support necessary to train and compete. In 1986 the IOC allowed professional athletes into the games.\nThere are those who regret the disappearance of amateurism from the Olympic Games. For them the games lost something special when they became just another way for athletes to earn money. Others say that the designation of amateurism was always questionable; they argue that all competitors receive so much financial support as to make them paid professionals. Most agree, however, that the debate over what constitutes an \"amateur\" will continue for a long time."

      "In the US and Britain, the slogan around colleges was \"Save water. Shower with a friend.\" Now, Wuhan University has come up with another system for the campus bathhouse. It charges students for the amount of time in a shower. Before entering the bathhouse, students pay for the amount of time they want in the shower with cash or their student ID card. The clock starts ticking the minute the tape is turned on. It pauses when a button is pressed for soap. An integrated circuit (IC) card reader at each tap shows the time. No money, no water. The benefits of the new system can be seen with the old system, which charged 1 Yuan for each person regardless of time in the shower. The university used about 320 tons of water daily under the old system, but only 160 tons now.\nMany students use the new system but opinions on it are divided. Some students say it is bad because bathing had become a sort of race. Many people using it for the first time are not sure how long they need to shower. Some might be embarrassed if their time is up and they're still covered in soap. They have to ask the bathhouse worker to help them buy extra time.\n\"It's a _ in the system that you can not buy extra time on the ID card,\" said Ren, a freshman in Wuhan University. The university is also considering some students' suggestions that they be allowed to pay after they've finished the shower. Not surprisingly, some are complaining about losing the hour shower. But many students say the move helps them develop a water-saving sense.\nWithout the time limits, most students tended to shower for 30 to an hour in the bathhouse.\nSome even used the hot water to wash their clothes. \"In my experience, 10--20 minutes is enough,\" said Dai Zhihua, a third-year student who usually takes 8 minutes.\nA similar system has been installed in other universities. Shanghai Normal University introduced it at its Fengxiang Campus in September. The bathing fee there is 0.2 Yuan per minute. One male student responded by setting a record with a two-minute shower."

      "It was 11 pm. Donald Lubeck was lying in bed. Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out. The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one, probably caused by lightning. Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. \"I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,\" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. \nUp a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911.

      "Scientists have exactly discovered the set of brain cells involved in making risky decisions, and have been able to control them in rats using targeted light. By changing the activity of the cells they were able to change the behaviour of risk-taking rats to avoid risk, hinting the approach could in future be used to treat people with impulse   control problems.\nRisk-taking is a key part of survival, knowing when to take a chance could pay off--such as moving to a new area to look for food when pickings are slim.\nWhile all animals need an element of risk, the preference towards it varies between individuals. Researchers found this variation, which determines how risk-averse an individual is, is regulated by brain cells in a region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. This cluster of neurons releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which regulates the brain's reward and pleasure centres.\nPrevious studies have shown that in patients with Parkinson's disease, taking medication which blocks specific dopamine receptors (DR2)   leads to increased gambling   behaviour and risk taking behaviour. In studies with rats, researchers were able to use a technique called optogenetics  --which uses light sensitive proteins to change the activity of cells--to modify cells with DR2 in the nucleus accumbens.\nRats were trained to choose one of two levers, offering them a choice between a \"safe\" or \"risky\" choice. The safe option resulted in a small, but consistent amount of a sugar water treat. But the risky choice consistently delivered smaller amounts of sugar water, with the occasional large pay off--essentially encouraging the animals to gamble for a bigger prize. Around two-thirds of the animals weren't keen on risk, opting for the safe option, but the remaining third were risk-seekers. Brain scans of the animals showed that those with low levels of DR2 consistently went for the gamble.\nBut using pulses of light to stimulate   the DR2 cells and improve their activity could cause the risk-takers to play it safe and opt for the guaranteed but less rewarding option. Once the light-pulses stopped, the risk-takers returned to their gambling strategy.\nIn the _ , stimulating the same cells had little to no effect.\nProfessor Karl Deisseroth, of Stanford University in California, said: \"Humans and rats have similar brain structures involved.\"And we found a drug known to increase risk preference in people had the same effect on the rats. So every indication is that these findings are relevant to humans. \"Risky behavior has its moments where it' s valuable. As a species, we wouldn't have come as far as we have without it.\""

      "You use her as a shoulder to cry on. She texts you back with casual jokes. But she, Xiaoice, is only a virtual chatbot.\nXiaoice, Microsoft's latest artificial intelligence robot, was briefly released in 2014, and returnen to WeChat in 2015, where she became a big hit. Millions of young Chinese now exchange messages with her daily, The New York Times reported. On WeChat, Xiaoice is an official account. After following it, users can start text-based conversations with Xiaoice.\n\"Her incredible learning ability was why people loved to talk with Xiaoice,\" Liu Jinchang, a researcher at High-tech Research and Development Center under the Ministry of Science and Technology, told China Daily. Apart from her ability to identify photos and send emojis m conversations, Xiaoice gains 45 percent of her knowledge from interacting with users, China Daily reported.\nChatbot programs first appeared in the mid-1960s in the US. Driven by top tech companies, they are becoming smarter and more common. For instance, IBM's latest artificial intelligence program served as an academic consultant at Australia's Deakin University, answering students' questions about course schedules and financial aid. Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa have been used as voice assistants who can read news, play music and even make jokes for their users.\nThese programs are expected to move beyond smartphones, into televisions, cars and living rooms, The New York Times pointed out. However, it may take decades before scientists develop a \"Samantha\", the advanced chatbot seen in the fiction film Her. In the film, Samantha sparks a romantic relationship with her user played by US actor Joaquin Phoenix. Many viewers were enthusiastic about this fan tasy of virtual soul mates."

      "Never before in Chinese history has a documentary film aroused so much public enthusiasm. Everybody is talking about a new 7-part documentary called A Bite of China which was recently broadcast late at night on CCTV I. The documentary describes various _ across the vast Chinese culinary   landscape.\nAccording to Taobao, China's biggest online retail website, just five days after the series began to air, nearly 6 million people went to the site in search of various local specialties, particularly those mentioned in the documentary. More than 7.2 million deals were concluded. A ham producer from Yunnan Province saw his sales grow 17-fold in five days.\nHowever, one can't help but believe that the documentary's popularity is probably linked to the endless stream of terrible food security issues that have emerged in recent years. In one well-received article, a netizen wrote, \"I wonder how many felt so empty-hearted and sighed after watching the film. Blue-vitriol watered chive, formaldehyde  sprayed cabbage, Sudan Red colored salty eggs, restaurants using gutter oil. The list is long...\"\nA varied and ancient food culture that is famous world-wide and which should have made the Chinese proud ends like this: one can only sigh. Food is the most vital thing in people's lives. Yet China's food industry is a typical description of \"bad money driving out the good\".The market is huge while the cost of faking and cheating is so low for unscrupulous   businessmen; and the punishment is too light. Take the milk industry as an example. Although Sanlu, the company that sold the melamine-adulterated milk powder, was punished, thousands of other dairies didn't work hard to improve the quality. In order to allow national brands to survive, Chinese authorities are happy to loosen their regulations.\nAs the documentary shows, people are attracted not to gourmet items like matsutake, a species of rare mushroom grown naturally in remote forests, but to common Chinese dishes like barley, lotus root or tofu. They are what meet our basic needs. This explains why people are so excited about A Bite of China---it is a reminder that there is still a world out there where food is excellent and people have dignity."

      "The adder is the only poisonous snake native to Britain. Adders have the most highly developed poison injecting mechanism of all snakes, but they are not aggressive animals. Adders will only use their poison as a last means of defence, usually if caught or trodden on. No one has died from adder bites in Britain for over 20 years. By faar the most common smake in Britain is the adder. In Scotland, in fact, there are no other snakes at all. The adder is also the only British sanke with a poisonous bite. It can be found almost anywhere, but prefers sunny hillsides and rough open country, including high gournd. In Ireland there are no snakes at all.\nMost people regard snake bites as a fatal misfortune, but not all bites are serious, and very few are fatal . Sometimes attempts at emergency treatment turn out to be more dangerous than the bite itself, with amateurs heroically, but mistakenly, trying do-it-yourself surgery and other unnecessary measures.\nAll snakes have small teeth, so it follows tha tall snakes can bite, but only te bite of the adder presents any danger. British snakes are shy animals and are fare more frightened of you than you could possibly be of them. The adder will attack only if it feels threatened, as can happen if you take it by surprise and step on it accidentally, or if you try to catch it or pick it up, which it dislikes intensely. If it hears you coming, it will normally get out of the way as quickly as it can, but adders cannot move  very rapidly and may attack before moving if you are very close.\nThe effect of a bite varies considerably. It depends upon severa things, one of which is the boidy-wight of the person bitten. The bigger the person, the less harmful the bite is likely to be, which is why children suffer far more seriously from snake bites in Britain ,and thought these bites can make soime pepe very ill, thre are probaably just as many cases of bites having little or no effect, as there are of serious illess."

      "It's a fact that we all dream. Some dreams seem to last for hours, others only for seconds. Some of us have strange dreams, some have interesting dreams, and some of us have unpleasant dreams. Tests in the 1980s showed that these dreams occur within 90-minute cycles, each cycle made up of six stages. In the last stage people experience rapid eye movement, known as REM, and it is in this stage that dreaming takes place. Eighty percent of people who were woken during this sixth stage could easily remember their dreams. On the other hand, when during the first five stages (NREM), only seven percent could describe a dream.\nHowever, of these same people woken during the first five stages, 74% were able to remember thinking activity, although they would not call it a dream. NerysDee, who has written about dreams in a book called \"Your Dreams and What They Mean\" says: \"Perhaps during NREM sleep we are sorting out our outer mundane problems, but in REM sleep we are dealing with inside matters.\" She also makes the following statement about 90-minute cycle: It may also prove the reason why _ who wake in the middle of the night find it impossible to get to sleep again for at least an hour and a half.

      "There are many acceptable varieties of English throughout the world. Whichever variety is used in your country, the most important thing is that students' pronunciation must be good enough for another person to understand what they are trying to say.\nIn a PPP lesson, teachers naturally include a good model of the pronunciation when they are presenting new vocabulary, grammar or functional language. It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them.\nSpoken British English has 44 sounds, but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English. This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different, so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages. Also, some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages. This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly. So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds, listening to them, trying to recognize them and trying to copy them.\nIf you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet, this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary. You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier. However, you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet. Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right. Students need to know:\n* which parts of a word are stressed (spoken louder and longer);\n* which parts of a sentence are stressed;\n* basic intonation patterns;\n* what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence (the music of the language);\n* how to link together the sounds within a sentence.\nStudents need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation."

So was her boyfriend.\n\"Later I realized that she didn't literally mean what she said and that she was not aware of the full meaning of the word 'hate' in English,\" said Du. \"It was more a problem with translation,\" she added.\nCultural differences can cause confusion about what words or even actions mean, an issue that has come to the forefront recently following the arrest of a Chinese doctoral degree student in New Jersey.\nZhai Tiantian, who studied at the Stevens Institute of Technology, has been accused of trying to set fire to a campus building and of making threats to a professor who gave him a low mark.

      "There are two factors which determine an individual's intelligence. The first is the sort of brain he is born with. Human brains differ considerably, some being more capable than others. But no matter how good a brain he has to begin with, an individual will have a low order of intelligence unless he has opportunities to learn. So the second factor is what happens to the individual--the sort of environment in which he is reared  . If an individual is handicapped   environmentally, it is likely that his brain will fail to develop and he will never attain the level of intelligence of which he is capable.\nThe importance of environment in determining an individual's intelligence can be demonstrated by the case history of the identical twins, Peter and Mark X. Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth processes were the same. When the twins were three months old, their parents died, and they were placed in separate foster homes. Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities. Mark was reared in the home of well-to-do parents who had been to college. He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated intellectually. This environmental difference continued until the twins were in their late teens, when they were given tests to measure their intelligence. Mark's I.Q. was 125, twenty-five points higher than the average and fully forty points higher than his identical brother. Given equal opportunities, the twins, having identical brains, would have tested at roughly the same level."

      "Humans may be a bad influence on their best friends---at least when it comes to problem-solving. In a task that wasn't very tough, wolves performed must better than dogs. All the animals had to do was pull the lid off a food container, containing a sausage treat.\nMonique Udell studies animal behavior at Oregon State University in Corvallis. She tested 10 pet dogs and another 10 dogs from an animal shelter. In one set of tests, a person was nearby but did not encourage or discourage the dogs. Those dogs typically spent 10 to 15 percent of their time gazing at the person. They spent a mere 5 percent of their time or less touching the container.\nUdell offered the same challenge to wolves. These animals had been raised and fed by people but still lived outdoors. Here, the wolves didn't look at the nearby person. Instead, they devoted about 90 percent of the time to struggling with the box holding a treat.\nWhen someone walked around the dogs and actively encouraged them to keep trying to open the  box, the dogs did spend more time handling the problem. A few more even managed to open the box. But their success rate still did not match the wolves. The dogs and wolves were also tested when no one was present. But even then, the dogs didn't paw or teat the box much more than they did when a human was present."

      "We know that the earth has become warmer over the last century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, reports that the average surface temperature of the earth has increased during the twentieth century by 0.6deg _ 0.2degC.(The _ 0.2degC means that the increase might be as small as 0.4degC or as great as 0.8degC). This may seem like a small shift, but although regional and short--term temperatures do fluctuate  over a wide range, global temperatures are generally quite stable. In fact, the difference between today's average global temperature and the average global temperature during the last Ice Age is only about 5 degrees C. Indeed, it's warmer today around the world than at any time during the past 1,000years, and the warmest years of the previous century have occurred within the past decade.\nWe also know that human activities--primarily the burning of fossil fuels--have increased the greenhouse gas content of the earth's atmosphere significantly over the same period. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases, which trap heat near the planet's surface.\nThe vast majority of climate researchers agree with these overall findings. The scientific disagreements that do still exist primarily concern detailed aspects of the processes that make up these largely accepted general themes.\nYou can think of this website as a window into the world of scientific research. In this primer, you'll find a general discussion of the physical processes underlying the earth's climate, an outline of the kinds of data that may shed light on how the climate is changing--and the role of human activity in these changes--and a description a some of the questions and uncertainties that researchers continue to explore.

Visitors have fallen to around 3 million a year from 3.5 million since Ling Ling's death.\nSince a boat collision near the Diaoyu Islands in September, Sino-Japanese relations have been at a low point.

Perhaps he visited Hawaii and got you a special key chain that you've always used; you can include that. Each family member is welcome to make something homemade that can be included in the box. Some ideas could be a painting or drawing or, even poetry.\nYou can also include something from your dad's past.

There is only the massive Australian wild land, where some houses are 500 miles apart and some driveways are 50 miles long.\nThere seem to be only two main sources of entertainment out here: the sunset at the beach and Sun Pictures.\nSun Pictures is a very different movie theater:The seats are park benches and deck chairs, but you're also welcome to sit on the grass.\nIt is the world's oldest outdoor movie garden. Sun Pictures was built in 1916 on the other side of the globe from Hollywood. All the big films were shipped here and the lonely country was amazed.\nBroome resident Pearl Hamaguchi has never traveled far from home. But in the Sun Pictures chairs, under the deep blue night sky, she has been almost everywhere.\n\"And we came back excited about Gregory Peck,\" she recalled.\nThis is one of the few places left in the world where you can see two sets of stars at the same time-----one set in the sky, the other in the film.\nEach night, dozens of people from around the world line up at the old wooden stand, with no computer in sight, and buy their tickets to the latest films.\nSun Pictures is also a museum, exhibiting projectors  that date back to the silent films, a portrait gallery of the famous people who never knew about this place---- even though they came here all the time.\nEvery once in a while, I'm told, you might find a non-ticket holder in your seat. That's why it's always a good idea to shake out your chair to make sure there are no spiders or scorpions.\n\"We've only had a couple of scorpion incidents but no one's been stung yet,\" said Aaron Mestemaker, a tourist visiting from Michigan.\nSun Pictures is a holy hall of movie history and a reminder that air conditioning and carpet are no match for grass and fresh air---even when the lizards steal the scene."

      "Studies show that you may be lied to every day anywhere from 10 to 200 times. We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/ husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity  , maybe to keep a private secret.\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds bluff  . Five-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery  . Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques."

      "Do you have a hobby--something you really enjoy doing in your spare time? Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could spend more time on your hobby and less time at work? Maybe it's not an either/or situation. Perhaps you can do both at the same time.\nWhen choosing a career, one of the things you must consider is your interests. Why then do so many people not even think about their hobbies when a hobby is, in fact, an interest? Perhaps it's because even Webster's Dictionary defines a hobby as \"a pursuit (,) outside one's regular occupation  \". Maybe this is a rule you should break. After all, no one ever said your hobby had to stay separate from your occupation. In addition people are usually very skilled at their hobbies. The combination of interest and skill is a very compelling   reason to choose a particular career.\n\"Who's going to hire someone who loves making beaded   jewelry?\" you may ask yourself. Good question. Don't wait for someone to hire you. Start your own business. That may be the best way to combine your hobby with your career. Those with hobbies that involve creating things, i.e. jewelry, clothing, or pottery, may do well to sell those items on their own. Before you go forward with your plans, though, you should find out whether being an entrepreneur   is for you.\nWhen you attempt to turn your hobby into a career, don't forget to do your homework. Even though you may have enjoyed training your pet birds to sing the national song, that doesn't mean you're suitable to be an animal trainer. Be sure to research your career choice completely. There may be aspects of it that just aren't for you. In that case, stick to your day job, as they say, and save your hobby for your free time."

      "Mary went out at night. She never forgot the night when she met a robber many years ago.\nThat evening, she was invited to a birthday party which lasted until two o'clock in the morning. Without company Mary walked along the quiet street.\nSuddenly from the shadow of a dark building a tall man with a sharp knife in his right hand ran out at her. \"Good evening, lady,\" the man said in a low voice, \"I don't think you wish to die here.\"\n\"What do you want?\" Mary asked.\n\"Your earrings  .Take them off!\" Slowly Mary's eyes looked down. She tried to cover her necklace with the collar of her overcoat while she used the other hand to take off both of her earrings, and then she quickly threw them on the ground.\n\"Take them and let me go.\" she said. The robber looked at her only feeling uncertain. He saw the girl didn't care for the earrings at all, only trying to protect the necklace. He realized the necklace would cost more. So he said, \"Give me your necklace.\"\n\"Oh, sir. It's not worth much. Please let me keep it.\"\n\"Stop rubbish. Quick!\"\nWith shaky hands, Mary took off her necklace. As soon as the robber disappeared, she picked up her earrings and ran as fast as she could to one of her friends.\nThe earrings cost 480 pounds and the necklace the robber had taken away cost only six pounds ten shillings."

      "In 1974, after filling out fifty applications, going through four interviews, and winning one offer, I took what I could get ----- a teaching job at what I considered a distant wild area: western New Jersey. My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen ------- teaching English.\nSchool started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that \"Make hay while the sun shines\" just meant to have a good time.\nBut, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class ---- seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.\nIn college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear as I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.\nMy boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn't happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\nHe was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.\nWhen he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, \"You had nothing to say to them.\"\n\"You had nothing to say to them\". he repeated.\" No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior\"? We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.\nAs the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson's words: \"The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil.\"\nFifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school. Thanks to the help I received that difficult first year, the school is my home now."

And there's a goodchance that you've also expressed the phrase, \"I never meant to hurt you.\"\nStop doing that, says author Caroline Myss.\nIn a talk Myss - a spiritual researcher - took on the topic of forgiveness and healing, and explained in no uncertain terms why \"I never meant to hurt you\" is never a sufficient apology, no matter who it comes from.\n\"Picture that person coming up to you and saying, 'Wow, l'm sorry I did this, but, you know ,l never meant to hurt you. And, hey, can we just call it a day?\"' Myss says.\nThough it can make the two bur\\ the hatchet and keep friendship, that type of apology won't sit well with the person on the receiving end. \"That whole little thing -  'I never meant to hurt you' - that's the thing you can't forgive,\" she says. \"It goes right to your soul, that toxic  (, )  , sick feeling.\"\nInstead, Myss says it's important to approach the conversation differently. Basically, it's about offering more than an apology. It's about sharing a soul-to-soul confession    . \"Let's redo the scene,\" Myss says. \"The person comes up to you and says... 'I need to tell you something. Iconsciously knew what I was doing. I know I went against you.

      "\"Colour\" and \"color1\" , \"favourite\" and \"favorite\"\"- Have you ever wondered why Americans spell those words without a \"u\"?

      "When I left my bag on a train, I lost my most precious possession, a small framed photograph of my great grandparents, Emily and Gordon Baker. The frame was made of silver, with an elegant flower design in one corner. The photograph was taken in March 1939 on their wedding day. Emily looked very happy, and Gordon looked rather alarmed.  A few months later, he was killed in action in North Africa. I received the photograph when my aunt Mabel died.\n   I'm a student at Edinburgh University and I live in an old Edwardian house.  At the end of last term, I packed a large bag and a small bag and set off for London, where I was planning to catch the Eurostar train to Paris. Minutes after getting off the train at Kings Cross Station, I realized that I'd left the small bag in the overhead luggage rack. I ran back to the train, but it had already left the platform.\n   This all happened several months ago, and I had become resigned to the loss of my most precious possession. Then last week, something extraordinary happened. I logged onto the site Bay and looked for a silver photo frame and I found it ! The photo of my great grandparents was on Bay !\n   I called the person who was advertising it. He was a little suspicious at first, and told me that he had bought it from a stall at an antique market. After we talked for a while, he asked if there was any way I could prove it was mine. All I could think of was that the photo was taken in March 1939. He opened the frame and made sure that this date was written by hand on the back of the photograph.\n  \"It ' s definitely yours. \" he said.  \"Come and get it ! \"\n5(11)"

      "Just getting accepted to an American college or university does not guarantee that you will get a visa. And getting a visa just lets you arrive in the United States. It does not guarantee that an immigration officer will permit you to enter the country. \nIf you are requesting a visa for the first time, you will probably have to go to an American embassy or consulate . You will need to bring a government form sent to you by your American school that shows you have been accepted. \nYou will also need banking and tax records that show you have enough money to pay for your education. And be prepared to provide evidence that you will return to your home country after your studies end. \nAll of this is important in satisfying the requirements to get a visa. A consular official will also take your picture and your fingerprints. \nForeign students must contact their local embassy or consulate to request an interview and to get other information. This includes directions about how and where to pay the visa application charge. The cost is two hundred dollars. \nYou should apply for the visa as soon as you have been accepted to a school in the United States. The government needs time to perform a background investigation. \nYou cannot receive a visa more than one hundred twenty days before the start of your program. And if you are coming as a student for the first time, you cannot enter the country more than thirty days before classes begin.\nOnce you come to the United States, you can stay for the length of your period of study.

      "Catherine and I were on our way to our nephew's birthday party one rainy Saturday morning, driving along what some people call moose  alley. It was early, there were few other cars on the road and we were looking forward to a good day with the family. Suddenly, a moose rushed across our path. Fortunately, a quick swerve  to the other lane prevented a full impact, with only a small collision on the right side of our car ripping off the mirror and knocking the moose to the pavement.\nBy the time I stopped and looked back in my rear view mirror, the moose was getting up. It ran into the bush. Shaken but unharmed, we both looked at each other shocked by what had happened. We knew that moose accidents had claimed many lives throughout the years, and that we had been very fortunate to escape with no personal injury or worse. After a quick check of our vehicle, we drove off.\nEven though the moose accident lasted just a few seconds, we still remember it to this day. Why?\nWe had often talked about the frailty of life, the here today and gone tomorrow potential we all face, but it had never felt so real. And it wasn't that we hadn't had friends, relatives and colleagues die before, it was that this experience was much more personal. In a matter of seconds, lives can easily change.\nThe effect of that one near miss with death has been positive, and made us appreciate life. Each one of us has only a limited time on this Earth; no one can predict when your time will end. We should give thanks for each day, to see the sun rise again, and to know that you can accomplish and assist others to appreciate their life if they are caught in the \"poor-me\" syndrome ."

She would remain quiet, sleep too much and turn wild, very often. At first, Linda thought it was just because of the problems she had met in her studies. However, Lucy became even stranger over time. Finally, Linda couldn't take it any longer and asked Lucy about her strange behavior. Lucy broke into tears and said that she was going around with a boy, who was taking drugs and forcing her to take them, too.\nLinda was shocked by her story. She then advised her friend to leave the boy. She reminded Lucy of her dreams of becoming a successful doctor and encouraged her to set an example for others. She also reminded her of how her parents would feel if they found out what their daughter was up to. Through her efforts, Lucy was finally able to leave the boy and drugs. During this time, her friend always stood by her.\nFinally, the two friends graduated and their friendship grew stronger. They both became successful doctors, but never let each other down by getting into bad habits. They lived happily as close friends.\nFrom the story we can know that true friends are those who encourage you to become the best you can ever be. They believe in you and will never leave you."

      "In 1955, a man named Raymond Kroc entered a partnership with two brothers named Mcdonald. They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world.\nWhy was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants.\nSingle parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth.\nFast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets."

      "A new collection of photos brings an unsuccessful Antarctic voyage back to life.\nFrank Hurley's pictures would be outstanding----undoubtedly first-rate photo-journalism---if they had been made last week. In fact, they were shot from 1914 through 1916, most of them after a disastrous shipwreck , by a cameraman who had no reasonable expectation of survival. Many of the images were stored in an ice chest, under freezing water, in the damaged wooden ship.\nThe ship was the Endurance, a small, tight, Norwegian-built three-master that was intended to take Sir Ernest Shackleton and a small crew of seamen and scientists, 27 men in all, to the southernmost shore of Antarctica's Weddell Sea. From that point Shackleton wanted to force a passage by dog sled  across the continent. The journey was intended to achieve more than what Captain Robert Falcon Scott had done. Captain Scott had reached the South Pole early in 1912 but had died with his four companions on the march back.\nAs writer Caroline Alexander makes clear in her forceful and well-researched story The Endurance, adventuring was even then a thoroughly commercial effort. Scott's last journey, completed as be lay in a tent dying of cold and hunger, caught the world's imagination, and a film made in his honor drew crowds. Shackleton, a onetime British merchant-navy officer who had got to within 100 miles of the South Pole in 1908, started a business before his 1914 voyage to make money from movie and still photography. Frank Hurley, a confident and gifted Australian photographer who knew the Antarctic, was hired to make the images, most of which have never before been published."

      "Is It OK to Snap   Your Food?\nHave you ever taken a snap of a luxurious cake or photographed a juicy steak when you eat in restaurants? You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying  to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \" foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher , snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred  chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing   towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright  bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \" foodstagramming\".\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \" Fotografia para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other dinners, such as never use a flash."

He says:\" When people misuse the service it means our precious time is being taken away from someone who really does need our help.\" Indeed, these hotlines are supposed to help the seriously ill or those with a life-threatening injury. You never know, one day, the person who needs assistance could be you or someone in your family."

      "Once upon a time two brothers who lived on neighbouring farms fell into conflict. It was the first serious one in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed .\nThen the long cooperoration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. \nOne morning there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm looking for a few days' work\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with. Could I help you?\" \n\"Yes,\" said the older brother. \"I do have a job for you. Look across the creek  at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow  between us and he took his bulldozer  to the river levee  and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better. I want you to build me a fence -- an 8-foot fence -- so I won't need to see his place or his face any more. Cool him down , anyhow.\" \nThe carpenter said, \"I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" \nThe older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing, and hammering. \nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. \nThere was no fence there at all. It was a bridge -- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work -- and his younger brother, was coming across, his hand spread out .. \n\"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\" \nThe two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother. \n\"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but, I have many more bridges to build.\""

But, to everyone's surprise, a few years ago June did come to large inheritance .\nAt first June said very little about the money. As the initial shock disappeared, she became excited, June is a great believer in making lists, so I was surprised to find her writing down all the ways she would spend her new wealth.\nAs time went on, she started revising the list. What had been midway down the list was now at the top. At last, I said to her, \"You know, it isn't necessary to spend all your inheritance at once. Take come time; think about it.\" \"I know, I know,\" she answered with a little bit anger.\nThen one morning June called, \"I've decided how I want to use my new inheritance. I want to see what you think,\" she said. This wasn't something I looked forward to, but we had been friends so long.\nAs we sat, June spread a sheet of paper on the table. To my great surprise, she had written only two words: Charities, and Grandchildren-in that order. Though I had promised to keep quiet, I couldn't keep from asking how she came to this decision.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I took your advice and thought about it.\" She added, \"Helping others means a lot to me, so I'm hoping this gift will help people in need.\"\nI interrupted, \"But what about this big apartment you most hope to have?\"\n\"At first it was hard, but it doesn't seem as important any more\", she answered with a smile.\nThen June moved her hand, and I could see a few words written in tiny letters at the bottom of the page.

      "Some mothers in Senegal are learning a new way to save the lives of babies born too soon. The idea is borrowed from the way mother kangaroos carry their young in front in a pouch. The baby kangaroo stays in this built-in baby carrier until it can survive independently.\nKangaroo mother care is also known as the skin-to-skin method for premature  babies. The direct contact with the mother keeps the baby warm. It also lets the baby breastfeed  at any time. The mother's heartbeat also helps control the baby's breathing rate.\nEvery year, seven thousand babies are born at the health center where Ousmane Ndiaye works in Guediaway, outside Dakar. One in five is underweight. But Senegal has few incubators  in which to keep premature babies warm. In Africa, one newborn in twenty dies. A major reason is prematurity, so the death rates are among the highest in the world.\nDoctor Ndiaye says babies who weigh less than two kilos get special attention from _ who assist with the births. They teach the mother how to keep the baby wrapped to her chest. The health center has a Kangaroo Clinic, a special area for teaching this method.\nDoctor Ndiaye says they plan to expand the program throughout Senegal. But he believes the best way to get more people to use the kangaroo method is for mothers who have used the method to tell others about it."

      "No one is sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids near Cairo. But a new study suggests they used a little rock'n'roll. Long-ago builders could have attached wooden poles to the stones and rolled them across the sand, the scientists say.\n\"Technically, I think what they're proposing is possible,\" physicist Daniel Bonn said.\nPeople have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks. And there's no obvious answer. On average, each of the two million big stones weighed about as much as a large pickup truck. The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away.\nThe most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths. Many scientists suspect wokers first would have put the blocks on sleds . Then they would have dragged them along paths. To make the work easier, workers may have lubricated the paths either with wet clay or with the fat from cattle. Bonn has now tested this idea by building small sleds and dragging heavy objects over sand.\nEvidence from the sand supports this idea. Researchers found small amounts of fat, as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths.\nHowever , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . West said , \"I was inspired while watching a television program showing how sleds might have helped with pyramid construction . I thought , \"Why don't they just try rolling the things ? \" A square could be turned into a rough sort of wheel by attaching wooden poles to its sides , he realized . That , he notes , should make a block of stone \"a lot easier to roll than a square\".\nSo he tried _ \nHe and his students tied some poles to each of four sides of a 30-kilogram stone block.That action turned the block into somewhat a wheel.Then they placed the block on the ground.\nThey wrapped one end of a rope around the block and pulled.The researchers found they could easily roll the block along different kinds of paths.They calculated that rolling the block required about as much force as moving it along a slippery path.\nWest hasn't tested his idea on larger blocks,but he thinks rolling has clear advantages over sliding.At least,workers wouldn't have needed to carry cattle fat or water to smooth the paths."

      "When his book Little Princes begins, Conor Grennan is planning a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month volunteer service at the Little Princes Children's home, an orphanage  in Nepal.\n              When he arrived at the orphanage, Conor was immediately welcomed by all the children even though he had no previous experience in working with children. He quickly grew to love the job. But it wasn't long before Conor came to learn that the children were not orphans at all -- they were actually children who had been separated from their parents by a child trafficker .\n              This realization turned Conor's global journey into a strong desire to try to find a way to reunite these children with their families. As a part of his efforts, Conor did a great amount of work when he was back in America. He started up a nonprofit organization called Next Generation Nepal(NGN), raising funds in order to buy a house in Nepal for another children's home. Then, back in Nepal, he began a life-changing trek  into the remote villages in the mountains of Humia.\n              It is really amazing to read about Conor communicating with the children and to read his descriptions of each of them. He made me truly care about the kids. I wanted them to be able to reunite with their families, too! Unfortunately, this was simply not possible for some of the children. But there were some children who received amazing surprises. Jagrit, for example, had thought for years that both his parents were dead. So, Conor was dumbfounded when he visited Jagrit's village and was introduced to the boy's father!\n              Conor successfully found many of the families of the children.

      "New York Times---( DINITIA SMITH )Tomorrow is the 433d anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. A recent survey shows that more people are watching him, reading him and studying him than ever before.\nConsider the recent yearly conference of the Shakespeare Association of America in Washington, where more than 600 people who study or admire Shakespeare from 18 countries took in topics like ''Whither Attribution Studies,'' ''Unpopular Shakespeare'' and ''Sex Me Here,'' a talk on breast-feeding and Lady Macbeth.\n''The national media is saying that fewer students' taking Shakespeare,'' Barbara Mowat, the editor of The Shakespeare Quarterly, observed in a speech at the conference. ''But Shakespeare is thriving.'' The association's membership has increased by a third since 1990.\nThe Shakespeare business is so good these days that W. W. Norton is introducing a huge new collections of the plays into the already crowded _ just in time for tomorrow's birthday anniversary. Priced at $44.95, ''The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition'' runs for 3,420 pages, offering introductions, illustrations and notes and three versions  of''King Lear.''\nToday, movies and videos have made the plays even more accessible. Last year, ''William Shakespeare'sRomeo and Juliet'' was No. 1 at the box office when it opened, and it grossed nearly $50 million. In New York in January, crowds lined up in the freezing cold to see Kenneth Branagh's four-hour''Hamlet.''The students select a scene and then have a violent discussion about it.'' Influenced by films, professors are increasingly teaching students by having them perform the plays."

      "It's a warm summer afternoon. You're cooking up the catch of the day over a campfire. Suddenly, a few raindrops fall on your arms, and before you know it, the sky is opened up. Then you hear what sounds like thunder in the distance. What should you do? Your tent is close by and would offer shelter from the pouring rain. There's a campsite picnic shelter a few minutes down the path. And then you remember that your car is parked down the road. What's your safest choice to make sure you and your families are safe?\nIt's a common question for many hikers and campers, especially when they are camping during summer months. Heading to your car is almost always the safest choice. Your tent and a picnic shelter will keep you dry, but they offer little or no protection against lightening. Your car, on the other hand, will keep you dry and protect you from lightening strikes. Protecting yourself against possible lightening strikes is very important; lightening kills an average of 62 people in the US each year. If you keep all of the windows and doors closed in your car, you'll be able to return to your campsite safely.\nOf course, if you're backpacking , not car camping, and you're deep in the woods, your car won't be a good choice. So, what should you do if your car is far away and there's no other safe shelter nearby? First, you'll have to make sure that tree limbs or other objects don't fall on you or your campsite. Then you'll have to get in a safe position to avoid lightening, or flash flood conditions. What else should you do?"

      "Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. For real - you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations and their high image   of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?\nWell, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. Repeated psychology tests have proved that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a \"social reality\". The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then, because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So, this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals.\nPeter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.\n    It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests - everyone wrote down their personal goals.Then, half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them toward their goals, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go to still achieve their goals. But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goals.\nSo audience, next time you want to tell someone your goal, what will you say? (Silence) Exactly - well done."

      "Many people write to newspapers and magazines to express their opinions. Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say."

      "Home to me means a sense of familiarity and nostalgia . It's fun to come home. It looks the same. It smells the same. You'll realize what's changed is you. Home is where we ran remember pain, live, and some other experiences; We parted here; My parents met here; I won three championships here.\nIf I close my eyes, I can still have a clear picture in mind of my first home. I walk in the door and see a brown sofa surrounding a low glass-top wooden table. To the right of the living room is my first bedroom. It's empty, but it's where my earliest memories are.\nThere is the dining room table where I celebrated birthdays, and where I cried on Halloween-when I didn't want to wear the skirt my mother made for me. I always liked standing on that table because it made me feel tall and strong. If I sit at this table, I can see my favorite room in the house, my parents' room. It is simple: a brown wooden dresser lines the right side of the wall next to a television and a couple of photos of my grandparents on each side. Their bed is my safe zone. I can jump on it anytime - waking up my parents if I am scared or if I have an important announcement that cannot wait until the morning.\nI'm lucky because I know my first home still exists. It exists in my mind and heart, on a physical property  on West 64th street on the western edge of Los Angeles. It is proof I lived, I grew and I learned.\nSometimes when I feel lost, I lie down and shut my eyes, and I go home. I know it's where I'll find my family, my dogs, and my belongings. I purposely leave the window open at night because I know I'll be blamed by Mom. But I don't mind, because I want to hear her say my name, which reminds me I'm home."

      "Flying\nEver since I was old enough to dream,I have imagined myself soaring with the eagles.My love of flying has shaped the way I live and the person I have become.Two years ago,that passion rocketed to new heights when I had the opportunity to visit Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.For a whole week I lived in a college dorm,roomed with a total stranger and---best of all---I flew!\nMy group took part in activities ranging from learning about the history of aviation   to flying in state-of-the-art pilot training simulators  .At least once a day,I devoted myself to learning one of the world's best training aircrafts,the Cessna 182.Not only did I receive thorough ground instruction,but I also got to fly.In total,I flew five hours to receive my private pilot's license.\nIn that one joyous and oh-so-short week,my passion for aviation grew even stronger.Now,\nwhenever I see a plane flying overhead,I feel a sense of pride thinking I've done that.\nDuring my time in and above the Arizona desert,I learned not only about the mechanics and\ntechniques of aviation,but also about myself and how I see the world.As I floated in that seemingly endless sea of air,I became aware of the variety and complexity of the humanity below.On the ribbons of roadways,each tiny car carried people with hopes and dreams.I wondered if any of those people had ever wished to fly like an eagle.Then I realized that each must have his or her own dreams and ambitions.That's what makes us unique.We try to respond to something special inside us.I also realized that I was especially fortunate to be making my own dream come true.\nEverywhere I go,I hear,\"Do what makes you happy and you will be happy.\"It sounds like\nstandard advice,but I've really thought about it and taken it to heart.I couldn't care less about how much money I make or what benefits I receive.I know that I am already in hot pursuit  of my dreams.And,even if they change,even if they finally don't involve aviation,I'll always aim to fly with the eagles."

      "Cyberspace, the connections between computers in different places, considered as a real place where information, messages and pictures exist, mirrors the real world in many ways. People ask for information, play games, and share hobbies. Others buy and sell products. Still others look for friendship, or even love.\nUnlike the real world, however, your knowledge about a person is limited to words on a computer screen. Identity and appearance mean very little in cyberspace. Rather, a person's thoughts--or at least the thoughts they type--are what really count. So even the shyest person can become a chat room star.\nUsually, this \"faceless\" communication doesn't create problems. Identity doesn't really matter when you're in a chat room discussing politics or hobbies. In fact, this emphasis(,) on the ideas themselves makes the Internet a great place for exciting conversation. Where else can so many people come together to chat? But some Internet users want more than just someone to chat with. They're looking for serious love relationships. Is cyberspace a good place to find love? That answer depends on whom you ask. Some of these relationships actually succeed. Others fail miserably.\nSupporters of online relationships state that the Internet allows couples to get to know each other intellectually first. Personal appearance doesn't get in the way. But critics of online relationships argue that no one can truly know another person in cyberspace. Why? Because the Internet gives users a lot of control over how others view them. Internet users can carefully craft their words to fit whatever image they want to give. And they don't have to worry about what their \"nonverbal\"  communication is doing for their image. In a sense, they're not really themselves.\nAll of this may be fine if the relationship stays in cyberspace. But not knowing a person is a big problem in a love relationship. With so many unknowns, it's easy to let one's imagination \"fill in the blanks.\" This inevitably  leads to disappointment when couples meet in person. How someone imagines an online friend is often quite more different than the real person. So, before looking for love in cyberspace, remember the advice of Internet pioneer Clifford Stoll: \"Life in the real world is far richer than anything you'll find on a computer screen.\""

      "Alaska's Arctic lakes now freeze later and melt earlier in the year than in 1950,leaving them easy to suffer water loss from evaporation and possibly adding to local warming,a new study finds.The winter ice season near Barrow,Alaska,is shorter than in 1950,researchers reported Jan.30 in the journal The Cryosphere.\nLake ice is also thinner each winter.The scientists surveyed 402 lakes on the North Slope,where permafrost (permanently frozen ground)and shallow lakes dominate the areA. In 2011,the lake ice was 38 percent thinner than in 1950,and 22 percent fewer lakes froze through to their bottoms.\n\"When we saw the actual numbers we were shocked at how dramatic the change has been,\"lead study author Cristina Surdu,of the University of Waterloo in Canada,said in a statement.Surdu and her co-authors analyzed the changes in lake--ice thickness and ice cover with satellite images and climate model simulations(satellite images are only available from 1991).\nThe climate models suggest the Arctic lakes froze almost six days later and broke up about 18 days earlier in the winter of 2011 compared with the winter of 1950.\"The changes in ice and the shortened winter affect Northern communities that depend on ice roads to transport goods,\"Surdu saiD. For example,every winter,oil companies build roads over frozen lakes to carry supplies to Prudhoe Bay.\n\"The dramatic changes in lake ice may also contribute to further warming of the entire region,because open water on lakes contributes to warmer air temperatures,\"Surdu saiD. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet,for reasons that may include its layered atmosphere,which traps heat,and the loss of sea ice and snow cover,which help reflect the sun's energy when present."

      "Do you love holidays but hate gaining weight? You are not alone. Holidays are times for celebrating. Many people are worried about their weight. With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\nDon't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\nControl the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to \"load up  \". You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist  .\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories.(238 words)"

      "Warm weather brought by El Nino has had mixed effects on animals in usually snowy places in North America, including New England, according to an Associated Press article.\nSome animals seem to benefit from having a chance to gather more food before winter, and from expending less energy in daily survival mode. Others, like snowshoe hares, are put at center stage in predators'  view when they lack snow for disguising their white fur -- not a good thing for them, of course.\nBlack bears, on the other hand, have been keeping busy gathering nuts and apples, when they would normally have settled into their winter homes by now. Vermont and Massachusetts officials have asked residents to wait till snow falls to take out their bird feeders for the sake of safety, the article said.\n\"We suggest waiting for 6 or more inches of snow that lasts before taking out your bird feeders, especially if you have been visited in the past by bears or if there are sightings of bears in your neighborhood,\"Forrest Hammond, Vermont Fish and Wildlife's bear biologist, said in the article.\"Due to lack of snow and frozen ground, birds are able to seek food in fields and forests for theirnatural foods.\"\nSnow amounts can also determine how comfortable bears are and how quickly they consume their accumulated fat during hibernation , noted Hammond in the article. This is because snow covers and traps them in their winter homes, and also hides them from predators."

      "Recreational tree climbing is taking root in the ecotourism industry, and it's sending guys like Tim Kovar to far off reaches of the globe. Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\""

      "Bungee jumping is an activity about jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord . The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser. The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirk, Chris Baker and Alan Weston of the Dangerous Sports Club. The jumpers continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982 they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot-air balloons. Later they put on commercial shows, which began in 1986.\nAs with any sport, injuries can still happen, and there have been deaths. A relatively common mistake in the cases that may cause death is to use a cord that is too long. The cord should be fully shorter than the height of the jumping place to allow it room to jumper either starts to slow down or keeps speeding up depending upon the speed of falling."

      "Animals can be extremely protective of their young. But when hard times call, animal fathers can be really a danger to their own kids.\nDaddy Lion\nA combination of laziness, pride, cruelty and anger makes the lion one of the most fearsome and worst dads of the animal kingdom. When not walking proudly across the jungle, the father lion just lazes around under the sun, or waits for one of its lioness  partners to bring back food. Once the lioness gets home the food, the lion eats up most of it, and leaves little or nothing at all for the kids. The father doesn't even train the kids for hunting and surviving, it is the lioness who teaches them how to _ themselves.\nThe Polar Father\nCute, pure and soft. Protective of young ones and family? Sure. But what makes the polar bears one of the worst dads of the animal kingdom? They don't take care of the young ones, they won't take up the responsibility of feeding them, they won't take care of them like a father should. They just leave that to the mother bear.\nThe Assassin Bug \nSize matters, you say? This little bug would eat its own eggs to stay strong and fulfill its hunger needs. The male assassin bug is actually responsible for guarding the eggs. The female assassin bug lays eggs in large numbers. The male bug eats the weaker eggs.\nDaddy Bass \nUsually, water calms you down. Not so much for this underwater species. The male bass is known to eat up eggs from its own spawn. It guards the spawn(,) laid by its female partner. However, when hungry and unable to hunt for food, the father won't think twice before eating up the eggs.\nAnd do you think your father was strict and hard?

      "It seems that the Englishman just cannot live without sports of some kind. A famous French humourist once said that this is because the English insist on behaving like children all their lives. Wherever you go in this country you will see both children and grown-ups knocking a ball about with a stick or something, as if in Britain men shall always remain boys and women girls! Still, it can never be bad to get exercise, can it?\nTaking all amateur and professional sports in Britain into consideration, there can be no doubt that football is at the top of the list. It is called soccer in the United States. The game originated in Britain and was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier, though as an organized game, or \"association football\", it dates only from the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe next is rugby, which is called \"football\" in the United States. It is a kind of football played by two teams of fifteen players rather than eleven. The rugby, in which an oval-shaped ball is used can be handled as well as kicked. It is a pretty rough game.\nIn summer, cricket is the most popular sport. In fact, it has sometimes been called the English national game. Most foreigners find the game rather slow or even boring, but it enjoys great popularity among the British.\nTennis rates high on the list, too. It was introduced into England from France in the 15th century, but it was from England that it spread to practically every country in the world.\nTable-tennis or \"ping-pong\" surely is not played on a great scale as it is in China or in Japan. Basketball and volleyball were introduced into Britain during the late 19th century from America and are gaining popularity. Horse-back riding, swimming, rowing and golf all attract a lot of people."

      "My father always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people unless such opinions are positive. He said this is the \"Chu Shi Zhe Xue\", the philosophy of dealing with social network.\n  It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.\n I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender.\n Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learned how to survive in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to get the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.\n All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. I say to myself:They are good and we are friends\". And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts.

      "They can be seen more frequently than ever before on college campuses, wearing thick-rimmed glasses while listening to indie  music. One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at second-hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being \"hip\" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \"cool\".\nHipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox.\n\"I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt,\" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University in the US. Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity, especially regarding music.When lesser-known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes: I used to like that band before it got popular.\nAccording to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become \"less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity.\"\nMany young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset  themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster position. Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted  the anti-mainstream culture.\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist  to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster.\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream.\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\"\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much?\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery . Writing in The New York Times, Wampole paints a less appreciative picture of a typical hipster.\n\"The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies continuously, searching for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation ; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things.\""

      "If you like bicycling as much as you like playing ball and can't seem to decide between the two sports, you may want to consider cycle ball--a fun sport that adopts the key attributes from both activities and transforms it into a totally new game..\nAlso known as red ball, the game was invented in 1893 by German laborers who wished to play polo , but could not afford horses. While the sport has not _ in North America, it is very fashionable in Europe and even Japan.\nPlayed in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball.\nThe one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads. In fact, if a player even touches the floor with his feet during the 14-minute game, it is considered a foul  and the opposing team gets a free kick.\nWhile the game was initially  played with normal bikes, things are a little different now. The seats of these specialized bikes are positioned over the back tire and they sport a single fixed gear, making it easier for the rider to control the constant back and forth movement required for the game. The handlebars  also point straight up so that the competitors can sit upright while playing and they are about twice the weight of normal bikes, which helps with the stability.\nWhile cycle ball may sound a little strange, it is a fast-paced sport that requires much training, skill, and, is also really fun to watch."

      "Two things changed my life:  my mother and a white plastic bike basket. I have thought long and hard about it and it's true. I would be a different person if my mom hadn't turned a silly bicycle accessory into a life lesson I carry with me today.\nMy mother and father were united in their way of raising children, but it mostly fell to my mother to actually carry it out. Looking back, I honestly don't know how she did it. Managing the family budget must have been a very hard task., but she made it look effortless. If we complained about not having what another kid did, we'd hear something like, \"I don't care what so -and -so got for his birthday, you are not getting a TV in your room a car for your birthday a lsvish sweet 16 party.\" We had to earn our allowance by doing chores around the house. I can stil l remember how long it took to polish the legs of our coffee table.My brothers can no doubt remember hours spent cleaning the house .Like the two little girls growing up at the White House,we made our own beds (no one left the house unitil that was done)and picked up after ourselves.We had to keep track of our belongings ,and if something was lost ,it was not replaced.\nIt was summer and ,one day ,my mother drove me to the bike shop to get a tire fixed---and there it was in the window, White, shiny, plastic and decorated with flowers ,the basket winked at me and I knew ----I knew---I had to have it.\n\"It's beautiful,\" my mother said when I pointed it out to her,\"What a neat basket.\"\nI tried to hold off at first ,I played it cool for a short while. But then I guess I couldn't at and it any longer:\"Mom, please can I please ,please get it? I 'll do extra chores for as long as you say, I'll do anything ,but I need that basket,I love that basket.Please ,Mom .Please?\"\nI was desperate.\n\"You know,\" she said ,gently rubbing my back while we both stared at what I believes was the coolest thing ever,\" If you save up you could buy this yourself.\"\n\"By the time I make enough it'll bu gone!\"\n\"Maybe Roger here could hold it for you,\" she smiled at Roger ,the bike guy.\n\"He can't hold it for that long ,Mom .Someone else will buy it .Please, Mom,Please?\"\n\"There might be another way,\" she said.\nAnd so our paying plan unfolded. My mother bought the beautiful basket and put it safely in some hiding place I couldn't find. Each week I eagerly counted my growing saving increased by extra work here and there (washing the car ,helping my mother make dinner, delivering or collecting things on my bike that already looked _ without the basket in front).And then ,weeks later ,I counted ,re-counted and jumped for joy. Oh ,happy day ! I made it! I finally had the exact amount we'd agreed upon....\nDays later the unthinkable happened. A neighborhood girl I'd played with millions of times appeared with the exact same basket fixed to her shiny ,new bike that already had all the bells and whistles. I rode hard and fast home to tell my mother about this disaster. This horrible turn of events.\nAnd then came the lesson . I've taken with me through my life:\"Honey, Your basket is extra-special,\" Mom said, gently wiping away my hot tears.\"Your basket is special because you paid for it yourself.\""

      "Every fall, many Jewish people around the world celebrate the holiday of Sukkot  . They build huts   in their backyards, and if it is warm and dry outside, they live in those huts for seven days and nights. Living in a sukkah   is meant to remind Jewish people that for 40 years their ancestors   lived in huts in the desert. In modern times, it has also become a reminder that many people do not have a place to call home.\nIn 2010, an American reporter named Hoshua Foer was building his own sukkah when he came up with an idea. He wondered what it would be like to have a competition for people around the world to use their imaginations to create modern sukkahs. It would be a design competition. But the sukkah would have to be built according to Jewish laws. These laws are found in an ancient book called Talmud. Some of the laws are surprising! ks5u\n \n* It can be built on a boat.\n* It must have at least two and a half walls.\nJoshua got in touch with his friend Roger Bennett. They announced the competition in May 2010. More than 600 designers sent plans. Twelve were chosen as finalists  . Then those finalists were each given money so they could build their sukkahs in a park in New York City. People building the final sukkahs were from the United States, France, England, Japan, and Germany.\nMore than 17,000 people voted   for the winners. At the end of the competition, the sukkahs were sold. The money was then given to a group that helps homeless people."

      "Thousands of people living in the Chinese capital will celebrate the start of the Chinese New year by heading for the ski resorts  . Never mind that Beijing's dry weather seldom produces snow. It is cold enough in winter for snow-making machines to make a covering for the hills north to the capital. And the rapid growth of a pleasure-seeking middle class has formed the basis for this new craze .\nSince Beijing's first ski resort was opened ten years ago, the sport has enjoyed astonishing increase. There are now more than a dozen resorts. Clothes markets in the city have added bright colored ski suits to their winter collections. Mr. Wei, a manager of a newly-opened ski resort in  Beijing, sees the growth of an industry that could soon lead Chinese to head for the ski resorts of Europe. In recent years, ski resorts offering natural snow have opened in China. But many are in faraway areas of the country and can't really match the equipment and services of some ski resorts in Europe.\nBeijing's skiing craze is partly a result of the recent increase in private   cars. This has led to the growth of a _ in the capital's suburbs  , which until the late-1990s were unreachable to ordinary people. According to Mr. Wei, about 40% of the visitors to his resort come in their own cars. The rest are bused in by schools, businesses or government offices.\nThe problem is making money. Starting ski resorts requires quite a lot of money; hiring land from the local government, preparing the hills, buying snow machines, making sure there are enough water and electricity to run them, and buying ski equipment for hiring out to customers.\nThe ski resort where Mr. Wei works cost nearly $4 million to set up. And as so often in China when someone comes up with a good idea, many others rush in and price wars break out. Beijing now offers some of the cheapest ski training classes in the world, though with most people rather new to the sport, expecting a few more doing the same job."

I stopped at a gas station about 50 miles from Oklahoma City, where I was planning to stop and visit a friend. While I was standing in line at the cash register , I said hello to an older couple who were also paying for gas.\nI took off, but had gone only a few miles when black smoke poured from the back of my car. I stopped and wondered what I should do. A car pulled up behind me. It was the couple I had spoken to at the gas station.

Soon afterward, I received a Christmas present from them. Their note that came with it said that helping me had made their holidays meaningful.\nYears later, I drove to a meeting in a nearby town in the morning. In late afternoon I returned to my car and found that I'd left the lights on all day, and the battery was dead. Then I noticed that the Friendly Ford dealership - a shop selling cars - was right next door. I walked over and found two salesmen in the showroom.\n\"Just how friendly is Friendly Ford?\" I asked and explained my trouble. They quickly drove a pickup truck to my car and started it. They would accept no payment, so when I got home, I wrote them a note to say thanks. I received a letter back from one of the salesmen. No one had ever taken the time to write him and say thank you, and it meant a lot, he said.\n\"Thank you\" - two powerful words. They're easy to say and mean so much."

In medicine as in law, government, and other lines of work, the requirements of honesty often seem dwarfed   by greater needs: the need to protect from brutal news or to uphold a promise of secrecy; to advance the public interest.\nWhat should doctors say, for example, to a 46-year-old man coming in for a routine physical check up just before going on vacation with his family who, though he feels in perfect health, is found to have a form of cancer that will cause him to die within six months. Is it best to tell him the truth? If he asks, should the doctor reject that he is ill, or minimize the gravity of the illness? Should they at least hide the truth until after the family vacation?\nDoctors face such choices often. At times, they see important reasons to lie for the patient's own sake; in their eyes, such lies differ sharply from self-serving ones.\nStudies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill patients do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate   faster, perhaps even commit suicide.\nBut other studies show that, contrary to the belief of many physicians; a great majority of patients do want to be told the truth, even about serious illness, and feel cheated when they learn that they have been misled. We are also learning that truthful information, humanly conveyed, helps patients cope this illness: help them tolerate pain better, need less medicine, and even recover faster after operation.\nThere is urgent need to debate this issue openly. Not only in medicine, but in other professions as well, practitioners may find themselves repeatedly in difficulty where serious consequences seem avoidable only through deception  . Yet the public has every reason to know professional deception, for such practices are peculiarly likely to become deeply rooted, to spread, and to trust. Neither in medicine, nor in law, government, or the social sciences can there be comfort in the old saying, \"What you don't know can't hurt you.\""

      "Dear Earthmen , \nI have enjoyed my stay on your interesting unusual planet. I think I understand the life on earth now and I would like to give you my impressions.\nFirst of all you live in boxes. Every morning you leave your big boxes and get into smaller boxes on wheels. All these small boxes race around and around, and finally stop to rest. You then leave these boxes on wheels and go to very large tall boxes.\nAfter testing all days you get back in your little boxes and return to your big boxes. There you sit and stare at tiny glowing boxes with moving pictures on the front.\nOnly one thing puzzles me. One day I went to a football game. A bunch of angry boys fought over a little round ball. Everyone yelled for them to stop but they kept on fighting. They were angry, I suppose, about being cooped up  in boxes all day.\nThank you earthmen for this chance to get to know you.\n Gratefully,\nThe man from the Mars"

      "Have you ever intended to be fully absorbed in your work but found yourself distracted by e-mail, the Internet and other things throughout the day? According to the survey made by a famous university in the USA, most people have the experience.\n\"People often lose their concentration when they are bored, of course, but also when they are engaged in challenging tasks,\" says Peter Bregman, the head of the survey. \"They sometimes have a feeling to escape from what's difficult or boring, so they jump out,\" he says. The part of the brain devoted to attention is connected to the brain's emotional center. Any strong emotion --quarrels with colleagues, problems at home --can interrupt our attention. Studies over the last decade have shown that too much work to do at a time can easily lead to distraction.\nRefocusing is hard for many people. Robert Epstein suggests the following, \"Stop and listen to some soft music for a few minutes. Find a good friend or a teacher and say out your matter on your mind. Go for a short walk or take a deep breath, where you breathe in deeply, count to five slowly, hold it and breathe out very slowly.\" This can \"blow out all the tension and the unwanted in your mind to _ your focus.\"\nTake more control by structuring your time and becoming more aware of your behaviors. \"Setting the phone alarm to go off every hour is my way of creating awareness,\" Mr. Bregman says. \"You have to inform yourself that you've lost focus in order to do something about it.\" Starting the day with a to-do list is also important, such as when to eat, when to go to the gym or take a walk. But if it's overly ambitious, you will put yourself in a state of anxiety, which makes it hard for the brain to concentrate. \"Choosing three or four things as your priority for the day allows your brain to settle down and focus,\" he says."

      "You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task."

The club has also gotten support from the Music and Youth Initiative,a nonprofit that develops after school music education programs in underserved communities in Massachusetts.

      "Boxing was long viewed sickly. Generally forbidden by law in earlier days, the fighting was usually done with bare fists, and matches often lasted forty or fifty rounds.\nIn 1882 John L. Sullivan, a fighter of great power, won the world heavyweight championship from Paddy Ryan in a bare fisted battle marked by hitting, scratching, and biting without any rule. Five years later, while fighting Patsy Cardiff at Minneapolis, Sullivan broke his right arm in the third round, but he continued fighting to the sixth round and won. In 1889, Sullivan defeated Jade Kilrain with his bare fists in another championship fight, winning twenty thousand dollars and a diamond prize medal. His admirers talked then of running him for the next governor, but he traveled to Australia for a boxing tour instead, coming back only to lose his title in a twenty-one-round match with a young Californian named James J. Corbett.\n\"Gentleman James\" victory in this match marked a turning point, for it showed scientific boxing was over strength. But Corbett's title ended in 1897, when another boxer, Bob Fitzsimmons, in less than three seconds, achieved his feats and then Fitzsimmons knocked out an Irishman, won the heavyweight championship of the world, and invented the terrible \"solar plexus punch.\""

      "Both are so much related to each other. And both are so dissimilar! What are the differences between friendship and love? Is platonic  friendship possible between persons of opposite sex? Let us try and understand.\nWhat is friendship? Why do we call a person our friend? When do we call someone a very good friend? If we care for a person, if we are always ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person, they are our good friends. We can always count upon our good friends in an emergency. We are always sure that our friend will understand why we acted in a certain way. We need not explain anything to our very good friends. The friendship is so deep and the relationship is so close, that most of the things are automatically understood by our friends.\nWhat about love? In a relationship of deep love, all the sharing that we discussed above are taken for granted. But love transcends(,) all these. During love, we are attached with a particular person, while in friendship, one may have many friends. A loving relationship makes one so much attached to the other, that one gets pained if his/her beloved is hurt! Love also involves a physical element. Friendship does not have that. This is a vital difference. Nature gives us love so that the species can go forward. Nature does not give us friendship.\nYour heart beats will never increase in expectation of meeting your friend. You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend. You will not feel totally lost, if you don't meet your friend for a few days. You will not have dreams in your eyes thinking about your friend. But in love, you will do all these and much more. Indeed, there is no comparison between love and friendship."

      "The father's role in the family is important. One researcher says babies cared for by their fathers have greater cognitive   development at one year of age than babies not cared for by their fathers. Another expert reports that by spending time with their pre-school children, fathers can help to develop children's language ability. Researchers also point out that for school-age children, fathers are one link with the outside world.\nFathers who value education have children who do better in school than those children whose fathers don't value education. What's more, fathers who spend quality time with their children may give their children happy memories which may last a lifetime.\nWhile each father is a unique  person who educates children in his own style, good fathers have something in common.\nGood fathers attend their children's school activities. They also involve the children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to see the workplace, or by taking them when the car needs to be repaired, etc.\nGood fathers expect a great deal from their children, but also accept and support the unique individuals that their children are becoming.\nGood fathers rely on explanations and reasoning rather than force.\nGood fathers know their time with children is really an investment   in them.\nBeing an involved father is good for children and good for fathers. Both children and fathers have the opportunity for growth and development. Today's lifestyles are changing. More and more fathers are balancing their personal life, work, and family time."

      "C.O.P.D  blocks air flow through the lungs. It makes breathing difficult. The leading cause of C.O.P.D. is cigarette smoking. Experts at the National Institutes of Health in the United States say there is no cure to the damage to the lungs.\nDawn Demeo is an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She said, \"By 2020, C.O.P.D. may be the third leading cause of death across the world.\"\nC.O.P.D. is a new name for emphysema  and chronic bronchitis . These are the two most common forms of the disease. Many people with C.O.P.D. have both of them. And Doctor Demeo says more women than men now die from the disease.\nShe is the lead author of a study by a team from Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital and the University of Bergen in Norway. The new study adds to findings that women may be more at risk than men from the damaging effects of smoking.\nThe team examined results from a Norwegian study of 954 people with C.O.P.D. Inga-Cecilie Soerheim co-wrote the team's findings. Doctor Soerheim says they show that women suffered the same level of C.O.P.D.as men. But the female smokers were younger and had smoked a lot less.\nThe team also looked at two groups among the people in the study. These were people under the age of 60 and those who had smoked for less than 20 years. In both cases, women had more serious C.O.P.D. and a greater loss of lung function  than men."

      "Shoppers who have cut back on purchases in the worrying U.S. economy are likely to continue their conservative shopping habits even if the economy improves, according to a new study.\nThat signals continued bad news for retailers , who have been struggling to respond to a great cutback in spending as consumers have opened their wallets only for basic items, while cutting back on unimportant purchases.\nThe report, which estimates retail sales growth to be flat this year, found that three-quarters of respondents to a monthly survey of 4,000 consumers said they had shifted their shopping behaviors because of the economy. Most said they were making do with less or going without some favorite items.\n\"The habits learned during this economic crisis have the potential to permanently change the mind-set of consumers,\" the report said. \"The vast majority of shoppers who are changing their near-term shopping behavior say they plan to continue them as the economy improves.\"\nTo ease the consumer discomfort, smart retailers will focus on downsizing, the report said, as adding stores to an already crowded retail landscape is out of fashion. It came up with smaller initiatives to build shopping buzz, such as limited editions of products or having existing stores target local markets. The report also forecast that retailers will increasingly focus on private brands to attract cost-conscious shoppers, while adding complementary categories of goods to their stores to make one-stop shops for consumers.\nWhile warehouse clubs and super centers are expected to fare the best in the weak environment in 2009, discount department stores and supermarkets will be the weakest, the report warned. Sales of clothes, though expected to rebound in 2010, will be the hardest hit and slowest to recover."

      "'Well,' began Enfield, 'I was coming home about three o'clock on a black winter morning, when suddenly I saw two people. The first was a short man who was walking along the street, and the second was a little girl who was running as fast as she could. Well, the two bumped into each other and the child fell down. Then a terrible thing happened. The man calmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots, and left her screaming on the ground. It was an inhuman thing to do. I ran after the man, caught him and fetched him back. There was already a small crowd around the screaming child. The man was perfectly cool, but he gave me a very evil look, which made me feel sick in my stomach. The child's family then arrived, and also a doctor. The child had been sent to fetch the doctor for a sick neighbor, and was on her way home again.\n'\"The child is more frightened than hurt,\" said the doctor -- and that, you would think, was the end of the story. But, you see, I had taken a violent dislike to the short man. So had the child's family -- that was only natural. But the doctor, who seemed a quiet, kind man, was also looking at our prisoner with murder in his eyes.\n'The doctor and I understood each other perfectly. Together we shouted at the man, and told him we would tell this story all over London so that his name would be hated.\n'He looked back at us with a proud, black look. \"Name your price,\" he said.\n'We made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child's family. With another black look, the man led us to that door over there. He took out a key and let himself into the building. _ he came out and handed us ten pounds in gold and a cheque for ninety pounds from Coutts's Bank. The name on the cheque was a well-known one.\n'\"See here,\" said the doctor doubtfully, \"it isn't usual for a man to walk into an empty house at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for nearly a hundred pounds.\"\n'\"Don't worry,\" said the man with an ugly look, \"I'll stay with you until the banks open, and change the cheque myself.\"\n'So we all went off, the doctor and the prisoner and myself, and spent the rest of the night at my house. In the morning we went together to the bank. Sure enough, the cheque was good, and the money was passed to the child's family.'"

This is because the glass glasses are more likely to do harm to children's eyesight.\nAlexander pointed out: wearing the right glasses as soon as possible is still the best way to cure and put right children's eyesight problems.\nIn America and Japan the resinous glasses have taken up 80 percent of the glasses market. And some European countries and America have made it a law that children, teenagers and drivers must wear resinous glasses. Now, about 10 million children in China have different eyesight problems and they need timely treatment.\nBut still, too many parents are buying the traditional glass glasses for their children. This is mainly because many parents know little or nothing about the good points of the resinous glasses. Besides, the price for the new glasses is a little higher than the traditional ones."

      "What's A Real Friend?\nYou can have the same neighbors for years. You love them or you think you love them. And you hope that they love you. But do you ever really understand them?\n    Charlie Kemp and his family lived next door to me for 15 years. We were good friends all the time. I enjoy friendship. I think it's the best thing in the world. And friendship with the Kemps was easy because they seemed to welcome it.\n    They were interesting and clever people. Their house caught fire twice, and twice the whole family slept in mine. They are always losing things like money, keys and watches. Pictures fell off the walls, the children fell out of bed ...\n    I was their neighbor and their friend. Life was always interesting, never dull. Best of all, I liked the whole family.\n    One day, I lit a fire in the garden to burn some rubbish. After some time Charlie Kemp came out of his house and walked up the road.\n    \"Morning, Charlie,\" I said, \"lovely day, isn't it?\" He smiled at me and nodded. I went on with my work.\nTwenty minutes later, a policeman arrived. He walked into my garden and said, \"You'll have to put out that fire. Your neighbor has complained   to us. He doesn't like the smell.\"\n\"My neighbor ...?\" I asked.\n    \"Yes,\" the policeman took out his notebook and read, \"Charlie Kemp. He lives next door, doesn't he?\""

      "Sir,\n    The majority(=Most) of your readers must have been surprised and shocked to read a letter from Mr.R.Hogg,published in last Wednesday's Herald.Mr.Hogg seems to think that his own convenience and that of motorists in general are the only things that matter in our city.\n    I would have supported Mr.Hogg if he had just made suggestions to improve the situation.No doubt his problems would be partly solved if the local government built a multi-storey car park in the city center,instead of encouraging motorists to use public transport.All the same,judging from the tone of Mr.Hogg's letter,I suspect that motorists who are so careless of pedestrians' safety that they would rather park their ears on the pavement than hold up the traffic would probably be too lazy to use a multi-storey car park if they had to walk a few hundred yards to their destination afterwards.\n    My main reason for writing,however,is much more important.Does Mr.Hogg realize that,according to figures  showed by the Department of Transport,13,000 people were knocked down in Britain last year because of ears being illegally parked either on the pavement or on crossings? In fact,although the total pedestrian casualty  rate has fallen over the last ten years,there has been an increase in accidents caused when pedestrians have to step out into the mad to avoid parked cars on the pavement and cannot see oncoming traffic.\n    I cannot share Mr.Hogg's view that the government have paid little attention to\"long-suffering motorists\":and I think the punishment for dangerous parking should be made severe enough to stop all motorists from breaking the law in this way.\nA WALKER,\nProudfoot Lane,Carchester"

As more are discovered all the time, you can be sure of seeing something new each time you visit.\nWe have a free Fossil Identification Service, so you can bring in any fossils you have and find out what they are. In addition, we have a reasonably-priced Museum Shop, where you can buy a souvenir of your visit. You could also bring a picnic and relax in our special picnic area.\nActivities\nFossil hunts are organized from the museum and run all year round. Groups of up to 25 are guided on a local beach where they can search for fossils. All these hunts are fully licensed and insured, and guides can help to identify any fossils found and point out things of interest.\nDue to the popularity of these hunts, all trips must be booked by a personal visit to Dinosaur Farm Museum.\nDid you know...?\nThe BBC programme \"Live from Dinosaur Island\" was filmed along the coast here, and Dinosaur Farm Museum was the base for the television crew.\nFind out more\nCheck out our website at _ to learn in detail how we dig for dinosaurs.

      "When American inventor Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, it was a revolution in communication. For the first time, people could talk to each other over great distances. Over the last two decades a new means of spoken communication has appeared: the mobile phone.\n The mobile phone is like a two-way radio. But the two-way radio is a limited means of communication. As soon as the users move out of range of each other's broadcast area, the signal is lost. In the 1940s, researchers experimented with the idea of using a number of radio masts   to pick up signals from two-way radios. A caller would always be within range of one of the masts. When he or she moved too far away from one mast, the next mast would pick up the signal. (Scientists referred to each mast's reception area as being a \"cell\". This is why in many countries mobile phones are called \"cellphones\".)\nHowever, 1940s' technology was just at the beginning. The \"mobile phones\" were huge boxes. They had to be moved by car.\nThe first real mobile telephone call was made in 1973 by Dr Martin Cooper. As soon as his invention was complete, he tested it by calling a rival   scientist to announce his success. Within a decade, mobile phones became available to the public.\nThey have changed the way we do a lot of things. One powerful feature is: the short message service (SMS) or text message. It's the perfect communication method for the busy modern lifestyle. The text message has changed the way we write in English. The language construction became more lax  . Traditional rules of grammar and spelling are much less important.\nOver the last few years mobiles have become more and more advanced. We have seen the introduction of cameras, global positioning system and Internet access.\nAlexander Graham Bell would be surprised if he could see how far the science of the telephone has developed in less than 150 years. If he were around today, he might say: '''That's gr8! But I'm v busy rite now. Will call U 2nite.'"

      "Two people have died after two separate university shootings in Texas and Arizona, just hours apart. One person was killed and three injured in the first shooting at Northern Arizona University early on Friday. Later that morning a shooting at a student complex near Texas Southern University left one person dead.\nIn Arizona, police named the gunman there as Steven Jones, an 18-year-old first year student at Northern Arizona University.Mr. Jones told police he was approached by a group of men and attacked. He fled, produced a gun from his pocket and opened fire when the men caught up with him, Arizona police said. Witnesses told police that the victims were unarmed.\nThe second shooting in Texas happened later on Friday morning at the University Courtyard Apartments on the edge of the Houston campus. One student was killed, a freshman at the school, the university confirmed, and another person was wounded. Two people have been arrested as suspects and a third is still at large, said Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva.\nThe attacks came as President Barack Obama visited families of victims of a college shooting in Oregon. On arriving in Oregon, he was jeered  by gun rights activists who oppose calls he made for tougher gun laws after nine people were killed at Umpqua Community College, Roseburg, last week.\nAfter a private meeting with families, Mr Obama said he had \"strong feelings\" about gun control, adding: \"We are going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place.\"\nOn the edge of this little American town, a few hundred protestors gathered to tell their president he was not welcome. Many were openly carrying handguns to _ their message. The demonstrators blamed the shooting here last week on two things: a failure to treat mental health problems and the designation of Umpqua Community College as a gun-free zone. Many of those we spoke to said they had travelled to Roseburg from elsewhere in Oregon to make their voices hear. The hostility to the Democratic president here in Republican rural Oregon was not just political, it was personal."

      "I'm usually fairly skeptical about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago. While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children aged 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.\nWhy are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation  brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.\nConsidering that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation.\nAt the top of the list is nurturing  a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.\nTo help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for facetoface relationships, and they will get more sleep.\nLimit the amount of virtual  violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.\nKeep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.\nMake exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable. But it doesn't have to ruin your life."

      "The rain had continued for a week and the flood had created a big river which were running by Nancy Brown's farm. As she tried to gather her cows to a higher ground, she slipped and hit her head on a fallen tree trunk. The fall made her unconscious for a moment or two. When she came to, Lizzie, one of her oldest and favorite cows, was licking her face. \nAt that time, the water level on the farm was still rising. Nancy gathered all her strength to get up and began walking slowly with Lizzie. The rain had become much heavier, and the water in the field was now waist high. Nancy's pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head. Finally, all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie's neck and try to hang on. About 20 minutes later, Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land, which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water. \nEven though it was about noon, the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy. A man from a helicopter  lowered a rope, but Nancy couldn't catch it. A moment later, two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter. They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym, where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter. \nWhen the flood disappeared two days later, Nancy immediately went back to the \"island.\" Lizzie was gone. She was one of 19 cows that Nancy had lost in the flood. \"I owe my life to her,\" said Nancy with tears."

      "Children today would rather toy with new technologies. The role of children has changed as well as that of teens. The world has truly evolved  throughout the years.\nToday,a typical day in the life of a five year old is entirely different from what it once was. A few decades ago children used to work. They did the kind of work parents do today. Today there are shows on which children are putting pounds of makeup on and have flashing things all over their bodies. This makes a child want to _ all of their imperfections. They think they have to look perfect all the time.\nTeens have changed as well. My grandma got married when she was thirteen. Girls who had an arranged marriage had no time to play because they were expected to cook, clean,take care of the kids, and do housework every single day. Today,we go to school every morning, maybe participate in some after-school activities, and possibly go to work for extra cash. Then we go home and do homework, and eat. After all of this we have to find the time to socialize by texting, talking on the phone, or logging on to social networking sites. We enjoy ourselves a lot.\nThe generation before us complains about how they did not have the things we have now. They say we are not appreciative and do not value life or just do not care about our futures anymore. Let's make a change! The youth have the power to work on whatever they believe in and make a difference in the world. Take advantage of your resources. It is never too late to make a positive change in our world."

      "How do you get a man to do his share of the house work? If you are like most of the women, you will face the question the hard way.\n   A man will enjoy a clean, orderly house, but he usually won't make the effort to clean or organize it. This doesn't mean that a woman has to do all the housework; she may have to manage many of household duties, and request his partner's participation. A woman can often say that men and women should take equal responsibility for housework.\n   Very few men are raised to be fully responsible for housework, and many men look on housework as women's work. On the other hand, most men will readily work around the yard, make repairs and complete projects on weekends or evenings, and it's important that you give your man appreciation for those things too. Most man will take a little additional housework around the house if asked politely. They are even more likely to do housework if they choose what they want to do, and do it without being monitored.\n   Here is the key; men want to feel that they are doing housework because they want to please their women.

      "In the last 500 years nothing about people--not their clothes, ideas, or languages has changed as much as what they eat. Chocolate   drink was first made from the seeds of the cacao   tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world during the 1500s. And although it was very expensive, it quickly became popular, In London, shops where chocolate drinks were served became important places. Some still exist today. The potato is also from the New World. Around 1600, the Spanish brought it from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent   on it that thousands of Irish people starved   when the crop failed during the years of 1845--1846, and thousands more were forced to go to live in America.\nThere are many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. But some others went in the opposite direction. Brazil is now the world's largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in other South American countries. But it is native to Ethiopia. It was first made into a drink by Arabs during the 1400s. According to an Arabic story, coffee was discovered when a goat keeper named Lakdi noticed that his goats were eating red fruits on a coffee tree.

      "Lonely Planet Publications is the largest guidebook publisher in the world.  With over 650 titles sold in 118 countries, it annually sells six million copies, giving guidance to travelers in locations worldwide.\nTony Wheeler and his wife Maureen Wheeler were the founders of Lonely Planet Publications and its first writers. They put together Lonely Planet's first publication- Across Asia on the Cheap.  Originally from Australia,  the couple had decided to travel from Europe back home to Australia overland-going through the countries of Iran,\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and South-East Asia, to eventually reach Australia. Tourist facilitres were limited in these countries, so if travelers wanted to go there, they had to eat and sleep locally. Many of these travelers were young and adventurous, but they didn't have much money, so going local was the only way that they could afford to travel across Asia. Frustrated that there was no guidebook to give budget travelers information on accommodations, food, and transport in these regions, the Wheelers decided to write a guidebook themselves. Full of humor and strong opinions, the book became famous among backpackers-budget travelers-as the chief travel guide for Asia. It made enough money for the Wheelers to travel more and finance their second book about traveling in Southeast Asia on a Shoestring.\nThis second book became even more popular and acquired readership outside of Australia in North America, Europe, and New Zealand. Sales developed so well that the Wheelers were able to open up a publishing house in Australia, and eventually opened up offices in the United States and Europe. Because the guidebooks were based off contributing writer's experiences, material was fresh and up to date. As more and more books were written, the series finally came to cover every country in the world."

      "Here is some must-know information from a handbook on how people behave in doing business in some countries.\nIn Brazil \nBrazilians are warm and friendly.They often stand close when talking and it is common for them to touch the person on the shoulder.People often greet each other (particularly women)with light cheek kisses . Schedules tend to be flexible,with business meetings sometimes starting later than planned.But to be safe,be on time.Meals can stretch for hours--there's no such thing as rushing a meal in Brazil.Lunches also can start in the mid to late afternoon.Brazilians are social,preferring face-to-face communication over emails or phone calls.\nIn Singapore\nSingaporeans shake hands when they meet and often also greet each other with a small,polite bow.Business cards should be offered and received with two hands.Arriving late is considered disrespectful.So be on time.Efficiency is the goal,so meetings and dealings often are fast-paced.Singaporeans are direct in their discussions,even when the subject is about money.Rank is important and authority is respected.This determines how people interact in meetings.For example,people avoid disagreeing outright with someone of a higher rank.\nIn the United Arab Emirates\nIn the UAE,status  is important,so the most senior or oldest should be greeted first with their titles.The handshake seems to be longer than elsewhere.So do not pull away from the handshake.Women should cover themselves when it comes to dress.Men also tend to be covered from neck to elbows and down to the knees.People do not avoid entertaining in their homes, but they also hold business meals at restaurants.Touching or passing food or eating with your left hand is to be avoided.When meetings are one-to-one, if your host offers you coffee,you should refuse.It might seem odd,but it is a cultural tradition.Coffee should only be accepted if it is already set out or presented.\nIn Switzerland\nThe Swiss tend to be formal and address each other by last name.They also are respectful of private lives.You should be careful not to ask about personal topics.Punctuality is vital,something that comes from a deep respect for others' time.Arrive at any meeting or event a few minutes early to be safe.They also have clear structure in their companies.Higher-ups make the final decisions,even if others might disagree.Neat,clean dress is expected.The Swiss follow formal table manners.They also keep their hands visible at the table and their elbows off the table.It is polite to finish the food on your plate."

      "To me, the ocean is our greatest wilderness. I love swimming in it , surfing its waves, watching it from shore and thinking about all the life living unseen under the surface.\nWhen I take my little kids to check out tide pools, we're overjoyed when we find a sea star or some shellfish. Lately, though, I've noticed a change in my favorite pools: there are more sea grasses and fewer animals with shells.\nI can't help feeling these small changes _ something more troubling about our oceans. It matches what scientists are telling us: our oceans are being troubled by carbon dioxide that threatens corals, colorful fish, salmon, sea otters, even whales. Our oceans are facing a major change.\nEvery hour, a million tons of carbon dioxide from cars, factories and power plants rain down on the world's oceans. Carbon pollution brings about a chemical reaction that turns sea water more acidic   and takes away things important for sea animals .\nSome of us are already feeling the effects of this growing crisis . Shellfish farmers in the Pacific Northwest have reported a decrease in natural and farmed oysters . Just this week, a new studyproved the link between the huge reduction in the numbers of oysters and ocean acidification. As polar waters become more acidic, Alaskan fishermen are troubled by the future of smaller fish.\nWithout action, ocean acidification will have a disastrous influence on the food chain, affecting not only sea life but the people who depend on it for food and their living. Already, our oceans have become 30 percent more acidic since preindustrial times, and it gets worse every day. We can stop this frightening dream, but only if we act now.\nThat's why the Center for Biological Diversity has started a petition   requesting President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan to deal with ocean acidification. Decisive action can save sea life as we know it.\nNow it isn't too late to save our oceans and sea life. With immediate action to reduce carbon dioxide release we can start taking important steps today to deal with this disastrous situation.

      "Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground. The plant-analyzing method is certain to work.\""

      "As people have accurately observed,smiles are absent from early photographs. In 1852,for instance,a girl sat for her Daguerrotype,her head slightly turned,giving the camera an unsmiling look. She is preserved forever as a very serious girl indeed. Charles Darwin,a loving and playful parent,looks frozen in photographs. Why did our ancestors,from unknown sitters for family portraits  to the great and famous,because so sad in front of the camera?\nThe severity is everywhere in Victorian photographs. However,you don't have to look very long at these unsmiling old photos to see how incomplete the seemingly obvious answer is-that they are freezing their faces in order to keep still for the long exposure times. In Julia Margaret Cameron's Portrait of Tennyson,the poet dreams,his face a shadowed mask of genius. This is not simply a technique. It's an emotional choice.\nPeople in the past did not go around in a continual state of sorrow. In fact,the Victorians had a sense of humor even about the darkest aspects of their society. Laughter was not just common in the past but accepted by society far more than it is today,from medieval carnivals  to Georgian print shops,where people gathered to look at the latest funnies. Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.\nPeople who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait. Like a portrait painting,it was intended as a timeless record of a person.\nTo me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more. But they felt no need to prove it with pictures. Instead,when whey sat for a photograph,they thought about time,death and memory. Perhaps we should stop smiling sometimes,too."

      "We might not be alone in the universe. Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life."

My mother had been doing Weight Watchers for some time and was rapidly seeing results without starving herself. She shared her books with me and explained the program: estimate your daily target based on your weight and other factors, write down everything you eat and move! The longer I stuck to it the more I noticed a difference in the way I enjoyed food. I soon began to like eating fruits and vegetables for snacks instead of chocolate bars and chips. My mother and I went on walks together and kept each other in check. Unsurprisingly, I lost twenty pounds soon and looked amazing in my wedding dress.\nI buy healthy foods, replace ice cream and faithfully keep a food journal. I exercised and take evening walks. Because I have a hard time reaching for something healthy by myself, I bought a Weight Watchers cookbook and use it to prepare our meals. I use small plates and bowls to trick myself into believing there is more food than the serving size. \nIt's been hard to discipline myself not to eat badly.

      "Dear residents of Molten,\n    We can't keep silent in the current wild situation when prices for all existing products are skyrocketing unbelievably. The enormous figures on price tags for food products have caused a real panic. We've perfectly realized that, and that's why we have kept bread prices affordable for all this time. \n    At the moment all our reserves are exhausted. Stocks of bread-baking ingredients   such as flour, sugar, butter and the like are running out. To buy what we need at reasonable prices is virtually impossible today. \n    However, we all need bread every day, which means we will be forced to buy everything we need at much higher prices.\n    The cost of bread closely depends on ingredients. Another financial crisis  has led to a 300-percent increase of prices for butter, vegetable oil and others as of September 1. All these prices continue to grow every hour. \n    We have to take any possible measures which will help Figaro contain the growth of prices for its products. Despite of our SOS signal, no measures have been taken as yet. We have found ourselves in the same situation as any of you. We see the situation changing steadily for the worse. We will not cope with that alone.\n    Because of this, Figaro came to the critical point where it is necessary to raise prices of its products. We see one recourse (way): raise the bread price minimally and cancel our free plastic bag service. But what is next? This is the concern of all the 700 employees and the board of Figaro. \n    Every extra cent in the cost of bread upsets you and us very much. Making our sincere apologies for a forced increase of the bread price, we hope for your understanding and support. Today and tomorrow we are with you, as usual.\nThe staff and board of Figaro"

      "No one has enough, but everyone has all there is. We each have just twenty-four hours in a day. Time is not our problems , but what we do with the limited time we have is the issue. Many people spend their days on dozens of activities , but achieve very little because they aren't concentrating on right things. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 Rule shows us that typically eighty per cent of unfocused effort generates only twenty percent of the results. The remaining eighty per cent of the results are achieved with only twenty percent of the effort . To effectively manage your time, you need to change where you are spending your time. We all have the same amount of time every day. How you spend your time is how you spend your life. Here are time management strategies, which may be helpful.\nLearn to say no\nPolitely say no should become a habit. Saying no frees up time for the things that are most important.\nMake a \"to-do\" list\n   List the tasks that need to be done in order of their importance. Save other less important things for when you have time.\nMinimize interruption\nPlan ahead. Think through projects. Look for ways to  _ interruptions. For example, close your door, don't answer the phone or work in a different space.\nCombine several activities\n   Try to do several activities at one time. While going to school,listen to taped notes. This allows up to an hour or two a day of good study review. While showering,make a mental list of the things.

      "\"Wake up. Alicia is waiting for you outside,\" my mother called from the kitchen. My mother didn't like me going for this weekend to my friend's house in the mountains. \"I trust you, but I don't trust the people out there,\" she said seriously. \"I'm going to be fine,\" were my last words before closing the door of the Jeep. The vehicle went along the dusty road and my mother grew smaller in the distance.\nThe trip over the rough road was uncomfortable. It was scary to climb the steep hills surrounded by great pines. After a long trip we finally arrived at the house. From the moment I got there I knew I would forever love the house. It was decorated like an old country home. My room was small, yet set up nicely. That night I went to sleep early, not because I didn't want to continue my search, but because I was tired after the long trip.\nIn the morning, the singing of the birds woke me up. The light was just getting through the window. A strong smell of baking and fresh coffee came from the kitchen. I wandered around looking for a living soul, but the house was empty. I had the whole day to myself; my friend had gone hiking. I didn't want to go with her. The main reason for this trip was to spend some time alone to think about the events happening in my life.\nAfter an icy shower, my energies were at their fullest. With basket in hand, I started my hunt. I did not mind walking alone; it was a wonderful feeling to be in contact with nature for the first time. The sound of the water running through the rocks gave me great peace. I never felt such independence in my soul before."

      "He looked like a pirate.\nWith his handkerchief tied in a knot behind his little nine-year-old head, he looked like a pirate, a sad pirate. The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\""

      "When I was 16 years old and in foster care in Tennessee, people told me I was unadoptable. But I desperately wanted a family. I sought the help of a judge, even the commissioner of the Department of Children's Services, and was adopted just a week before my 18th birthday.\nWe have a lot to be grateful for and this holiday season let's not forget about the more than 415,000 youth in foster care especially older youth. These youth are the most likely to get overlooked for adoption, but they shouldn't be. They need and deserve a family just as much as young children do. Making an older youth a part of your family can bring just as much a joy as adopting a baby or a younger child--without all the diapers and potty training.\nMy adoption was life changing and probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I still remember the first gift my parents gave to me. It was a Mickey Mouse key chain with a key to their home. They told me that no matter what happened they would always love me and I'd always have a place to come home to. This is our 17th Thanksgiving together...\nMy first Thanksgiving with my family was a little overwhelming with lots of extended family including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. However, it's when I realized that I would never have to spend another holiday alone and that was truly an amazing feeling.\nI was always eager to spend time with my little sister, Beth. She was six when I joined the family. My dad always says he knew we were really sisters, and I was no longer a guest in the house when Beth and I had our first fight. Today, she's one of my best friends, and I'm her biggest cheerleader.\nThere were also bittersweet Thanksgivings. One we spent in my mom's hospital room. It was there that she helped me plan my wedding but passed away three weeks before the ceremony. My dad walked me down the aisle, and my sister was my maid of honor. Because of our bond, we were able to support each other through that challenging time and that's what family is for--the good and bad times.\nIt's nice having my dad and sister to share holidays and special occasions. But they're even more important when it comes to the little things--like having someone to share my bad day with, celebrate my promotion at work, or help me think through a difficult decision. It's in these moments that I just can't imagine being alone in the world.\nI'm so glad that I didn't listen to those people who said I was unadoptable, I'd never find a family, and that I was putting myself out there for rejection. It's a risk for older foster youth to consider adoption. _ But it's a risk they should take because life doesn't end at 18. It's really just beginning.\nIf you know someone who might consider adopting an older teen, please share my story -- and have him or her think of my family. They didn't get to see my first steps or watch me be a pilgrim in my second grade Thanksgiving play. But they taught me so many things about life, and were there to watch me walk across the stage when I graduated from college and law school and accompanied me to the White House last year as I was honored for my work helping foster youth.\nI look forward to many more Thanksgivings with my family, and I'm eternally thankful they chose me to be a part of their family."

      "Schoolgirls have been wearing such short skirts at Paget High School in Branston that they've been ordered to wear trousers instead. All skirts will be banned from September. Tight-fitting trousers will also be forbidden and Muslim head-dresses will have to be \"school blue'' color.\nHead teacher Don Smith said, \"One of the big problems for us at the school has been the number of girls who have been wearing inappropriately short skirts. This has been an area of particular concern at a time when there has been a lot of material nationally about the sexualisation of young people.\"\nHe also said, \" It will be impractical to police the length of girls' skirts. A blanket ban will be easier for staff to put into practice. We did not want to arrive at a situation where we were telling girls their skirts could only be a certain number of centimeters above or below the knee. Pupils', parents' and other teachers' opinions were sought before the uniform rules were changed.,,\nThe new clothing policy has been explained in a letter sent to parents of the school's 1,000 pupils and will come into force after the summer holiday. Support will be given to parents unable to afford the new tie. The school also wants pupils to wear clip-on ties instead of traditional neckties.\nBut the new uniform rules have not been well received by everyone. One parent, whose teenage daughter attends the school, said, \"I completely agree some girls were wearing skirts that were too short. However, I think girls should be allowed to be feminine .Other schools manage to let girls wear skirts while making sure they are not inappropriately dressed.

      "While Americans feel worried about how to look after their children and help them grow, French parents are raising happy, well-behaved children without all the anxiety.\n   Pamela Druckerman, an American mother living in Paris, watched carefully as to why French children seem to behave so much better than American children. Let's listen to what she said.\n   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it.\n   After surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I have encountered mostly sleep throughout the night from two or three months old. Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat. French kids always have three meals a day and one snack at about 4:00 pm."

After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary employee . John could not take it any more, so he sent his resignation  and complained that the boss did not value hard working workers but only promoted those who said good words of him.\nThe boss knew that John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, \"Thank you for telling me, but I have a request. I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave. Perhaps you will change your mind and take back your resignation.\"\nJohn agreed. The boss asked him to go and find out anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found out a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much per kg, John shook his head and went back to the market to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kg.\nThe boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. Bobby went, returned and said only one person sold watermelons. $1.2 for a kg, $10 for 10kg and his watermelons added up to 340. On the table 58 melons, every melon weighs about 2 kg, bought from the south two days ago and they were fresh, red and good quality.\nJohn was surprised and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to go away but to learn from Bobby.\nThe story tells us that a more successful person is more concerned and thinks more. Chances are there in the daily details. For the same thing, a person sees one year ahead, while another sees only tomorrow. The difference between a year and a day is 365 times, how could you win?"

      "There is an English saying: \"Laughter is best medicine.\" Until recently, few people took the saying seriously. Now, however, doctors have begun to look into laughter and the effects it has on the human body. They have found that laughter really can improve people's health.\nTests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercises. It increases blood pressure, the heart beating and breathing. It also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach, and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be beneficial.\nOther tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group that tolerated  the pain for the longest time was the groups which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemicals in the brain which _ both stress and pain.\nAs a result of these discoveries, some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they help to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is enough to produce beneficial effects similar to those who are caused by laughter."

      "\"Now I just don't believe that.\" Surely all of us, at some point, have watched a movie and thought: It's simply badly researched, or, the makers must think we're fools.\nIf movies were completely scientifically accurate, they'd probably be as interesting as a Physics 101 lecture. In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head.\nRecently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about.\nTelegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,\" jokes Chivers.\nIt's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nChivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.\nFew people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.\nAnd finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has \"gene therapy\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible."

      "Due to climate change, Arctic ice is breaking up earlier in the spring, and its area is decreasing. This is creating problems for polar bears that make their homes off northern Alaska and in Hudson Bay.\nPolar bears off Alaska normally hunt and raise their young on ice sheets that float on the ocean. But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed.\nIn Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier. Over the past 25 years, the average weight of the female bears has dropped 68 kg. This loss affects their ability to reproduce, and already the number of births has dropped 15 percent. Unless the bears can learn to survive these climate changes, these giants of the ice may one day disappear."

They want to do something besides sitting in a classroom.\" Lerman says the education system in the United States in too focused on pushing students to attend university. \"What we're doing now is we're doing now is we're saying unless you learn in this way you don't really have the chance for a rewarding career,\" he said.\nBut Chad Aldeman, an analyst, says studies show the longer students saty in school the better chance they have at having a high paying and stable career. \"If you only are a high school graduate your wages are going to drop over your lifetime-as opposed to a college degree,\" he said. \"The college degree is really and insurance policey against unemployment and against low wages.\""

      "When we donate  blood, a small amount is usually taken in advance for at least ABO and Rh systems typing. If you are O+, the O is your ABO type and the + is your Rh type. It is possible to be A, B, AB, or O as well as Rh + or Rh-.\nThe ABO system was discovered by Karl Landsteiner in the early 1900s. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his achievements. There are four basic types of blood in the ABO system: A, B, AB and O. Everybody is born with one of these four types of blood. We get blood type, just like hair color and height from parents. Because of the substances  contained in each type, the four groups must be _ carefully, If two different blood types are mixed together, it may put a person into an extremely dangerous situation. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types, so it is often called the universal donor. However, there is still a risk. For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal receiver. However, because there can be so many reactions in the blood bank of the hospital.\nThere is a relationship between your blood type and your nationality. Among the Europeans, about 45 percent have type O while 42 percent have type A. The least common is type AB. Other races have different percentage. For example, some American Indian groups have nearly 100 percent type O out of 100 donors in the world."

      "In 2005,the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph,Untitled(Cowboy),was sold for $1 248 000.\nPrince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called \"found photographs\"--a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album.The German artist Joachim Schmid,who believes \"basically everything is worth looking at\",has gathered discarded photographs,postcards and newspaper images since 1982.In his on-going project,Archiv,he groups photographs of family life according to themes:people with dogs;teams;new cars;dinner with the family;and so on.\nLike Schmid,the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion found photographs.One of them,called simply Found,was born one snowy night in Chicago,when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for someone else:\"Why's your car HERE at HER place?\"The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication,which features found photographs sent in by readers,such as a poster discovered in your drawer.\nThe whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions.Perhaps one of the most difficult is:can these images really be considered as art?And,if so,whose art?Yet found photographs produced by artists,such as Richard Prince,may raise endless possibilities.What was the cowboy in Prince's Untitled doing?Was he riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone?Or how did Prince create this photograph?It's anyone's guess.In addition,as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists,like Schmid,have collated ,we also turn toward our own photographic albums.Why is memory so important to us?Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children,our parents,our lovers,and ourselves?Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone?\nIn the absence of established facts,the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely.That,above all,is why they are so fascinating."

      "Why do men die earlier than women? The latest research makes it known that the reason could be that men's hearts go into rapid decline  when they reach middle age.\nThe largest study of the effects of ageing on the heart has found that women's _ may be linked to the fact that their hearts do not lose their pumping power with age.\n\"We have found that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25 percent between 18 and 70 years of age,\" said the head of the study, David Goldspink of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.\n\"Within the heart there are millions of cells that enable it to beat. Between the age of 20 and 70, one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,\" said Goldspink. \"This is part of the ageing process.\"\nWhat surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells. A healthy 70-year-old woman's heart could perform almost as well as a 20-year-old one's. \"This gender( ) difference might just explain why women live longer than men,\" said Goldspink. They studied more than 250 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 80, focusing on healthy persons to remove the confusing influence of disease. \"The team has yet to find why ageing takes a greater loss on the male heart,\" said Goldspink.\nThe good news is that men can improve the health of their heart with regular exercise. Goldspink stressed that women also need regular exercise to prevent their leg muscles becoming smaller and weaker as they age."

      "What did you dream about last night? Did your teeth fall out or did you fly? Maybe you died or someone you know did.Or maybe you were back in high school.These are among the most common dreams people have and they all mean something.Here are some of the most common dreams and their interpretations or symbolism.\nDreams of flying.Dreams of flying represent feelings of freedom that may result from an instance when you overcome a limitation or obstacle.Usually, children have more flying dreams than adults, because children are more open to their possibilities, and adults have often accepted limitations imposed by society.\nTeeth falling out.Food in a dream is symbolic of knowledge because food nourishes the physical body and knowledge nourishes the soul.Teeth are a means to break down food or knowledge.When your teeth fall out in a dream, it could signify that you feel ill - equipped to break down the knowledge that you have available, that the way you break things down has changed.That change can be either positive or negative.\nHigh school dreams.High school is a place of learning from the past, and dreaming of being unprepared for a high school test can indicate a struggle to access information you need to handle in your life.\nRecurring dreams and nightmares.Recurring dreams are your subconscious  mind's way of trying to get your attention.A recurring dream is a step down from a nightmare that is a louder, more insistent way your subconscious mind communicates.If you have a recurring dream, try to stop in the dream and _ what the dream is trying to tell you.That could mean asking someone who is chasing you what he or she wants.A woman dreamed for years that an old, haggard woman was chasing her around her home.When she finally stopped in the dream and asked the old woman what she represented, the old woman suddenly turned into a beautiful young woman and replied, \"I represent your question of ' what if?' \""

      "My mother, Marisol Torres, came with her family to Australia in the early 1960s. Then my parents' marriage ended and Mum began the study of precious stones. Her interest in opals   took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries  , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\"\nIt's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life."

      "It is amazing to note that the Internet is still such a new device, and yet it is one of the fastest and most powerful media tools. But think about it for a moment. On the Internet, a big online company can be run by two guys out of their garage. So it is only reasonable that people shopping on the Net would be a little _ of the security levels.\nInternet giants such as Microsoft knew consumer confidence was the key to getting virtual shopping off the ground, and they work hard to make people feel safe to shop online.\nCredit card companies, too, quickly saw the potential for Internet shopping, and have installed things like online shopping insurance for people. If you ever have a problem with your online credit purchases, many credit card companies will happily refund  your money and then set their claws on the company that wronged you. Now that's buying power!\nThere are other bonuses for online shoppers, of course. No line-ups, for one. No annoying mall shopping carts with broken wheels and kids crying because their parents won't get them what they want.\nWhen shopping online, consumers can sit down, have a coffee, and wear their slippers, not have to worry about their hair or parking and just click through sale after sale. Comparison shopping couldn't be any easier. And thanks to courier companies getting in on the act, you never need wait longer than a day or two to get those all important purchases delivered right to your door.\nNo wonder so many companies are shaking their heads at traditional advertising and instead looking to the \"virtual\" world to attract online shoppers."

You may use a piano or any other musical instrument, if someone can play it. You may use a tape recorder. You can even use a radio.\nPut the chairs in a row. The chairs may be put in twos, back to back. A better way is to have the chairs in one row with each chair facing in the opposite direction to the chair next to it.\nThe game is easy. When the music starts, the players walk round the chairs. Everyone goes in the same direction, of course, they should walk in time to the music. If the music is fast they should walk quickly. If the music is slow, they should walk slowly.\nThe person playing music cannot see the people in the game. When the music stops, the players try to sit on the chairs. If a person cannot find a chair to sit on, he drops out. Then, before the music starts again, one chair must be taken away. When the music stops again, one more player will be out..

While friends can send a sick person to the hospital or pick up medicine, the advantages go well beyond physical help. Friendship clearly has a big psychological effect. \"People with stronger friendships feel like there is someone they can turn to,\" said Karen, a doctor. \"The message of these studies is that friends make your life better. \""

      "Coral reefs  are not just beautiful to look at,but also very useful.They shelter nearly 25% of ocean life and provide food for billions of people.However, like many other species,this amazing ecosystem  is in danger of dying out!\nThere are two main reasons for the destruction--the rising carbon dioxide levels caused by global warming as well as human influences like bottom operation.While not much can be done about the former,the loss caused by the latter can be reduced.\nBottom operation involves dropping nets to the ocean bed and then dragging them up when filled with fish.This action damaged the ocean floor,causing the coral branches to separate from the reefs.While that is very discouraging,the good news is that if these branches are found quickly,they can be saved.At present,that work is being performed by volunteer divers. But the method has only limited success because they cannot stay long underwater, nor reach depths of over 200 meters where some of the deep-sea coral grows.\nHowever,this is not the case for Coralbots--the robots that can constantly seek out broken branches.A team of 'coral bots',each individually working to simple rules will piece together damaged bits of coral, allowing them to regrow. They are programmed to be able to distinguish between other things and the coral.The robots work together in groups,similar to bees.If one coralbot is damaged, then the others will still be able to complete the task.\nDr Lea-Anne Henry said:\"The project of using coralbots offers us the possibility to restore  the function of reefs.It is in the final stage of testing.Once ready, the researchers hope to build hundreds of _ and use them effectively in the waters off Scotland and then hopefully in the oceans across the world.\""

As a result, fingerprints offer a most useful and _ way of identifying people. Any ridged part of the hand and the foot may be used as a means of identification, but finger impressions are usually preferred since they can be taken easily and quickly.\nFingerprints are classified in the ways: by general shapes and contours , by the finger positions of the pattern-types, and by size (often measured by counting the ridges in the loops). Every set of fingerprints has different \"ridge characteristics\" (i. e. the print of each separate finger is different from that of all the other fingers), which belong to one of four basic groups: arches, loops, whorls and composites. All fingerprints can then be divided into 1, 024 groups.

      "A treasure trove hidden for centuries has been discovered in the underground vaults of a temple in southern India. The treasures include gold, diamonds and precious stones. The estimated value of the hoard is reportedly 22 billion US dollars.\nHundreds of armed police have been deployed around the temple. Meanwhile, a debate about how to use the money has also broken out across the country. After discovering the treasure trove in Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in the southern Indian state of Kerala, the local government has assured  security of the temple.\nElaborating on the security arrangements, Venugopalan Nair, Additional Director General of the Kerala Police, says the latest security devices are being used to guard the temple.\nVenugopalan Nair, Additional Dir. Gen. of Kerala Police, said, \"We are trying to bring in the latest technology with regards to surveillance  cameras, with regards to, you know digitalizing the various things which are available inside. We are keeping a constant sort of surveillance for every movement, which happens in the whole area surrounding the temple.\"\nAccording to temple authorities, the crowd at the temple has increased steeply after news of the discovery of the treasure trove. And the Administrative Officer of the Temple says the government has initiated appropriate steps to control the curious crowds visiting the temple.\nG. Jayasekharan Nair, administrative officer, said, \"To control the crowds the government itself is taking a lot of measures. They are trying to do whatever is possible from the premises of the temple. Apart from all that, the government has taken a favorable step and we are satisfied with them.\"\nOver the last week, a seven-member team of investigators broke into five secret subterranean vaults, and discovered jewels that have been lying untouched for hundreds of years.\nAs estimates of the treasures' worth rise, a fierce debate is growing regarding what to do with the discovery. Kerala's top elected leader said the wealth would remain with the temple, while others say it should be used to pay for poverty alleviation . However, the government is adhering to the Supreme Court's ruling on ownership of the treasure found in the temple."

      "Guide dogs are going to be available for the children who are unable to see normally in the UK for the first time, as the age limit is to be removed. The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association is to begin training dogs to help blind people under the age of 16.\nThe association says too many youngsters with impaired eyesight are lacking in independence. They have only a limited social life because of their disability. Giving some of them guide dogs at a younger age is intended to help them to widen their range of activities and to improve their sense of self-confidence and independence. Guide dogs for these teenagers will begin to be provided from next year. There has been an experimental project to test the use of guide dogs with younger people.\nCharlotte, aged 14, was among the youngest guide dog owners. She had been gradually losing her eyesight since the age of eight, and lost her eyesight completely this year. She has been assisted by a two-year-old guide dog. Charlotte used to have a long stick to help her move around, but having a guide dog allows her much more freedom and makes her feel safer.\nHowever, the association says there is a worryingly _ supply of services for the young blind people across the UK, and it calls for national standards to be introduced. As with adult blind people, only a small number of them are likely to be considered suitable for a guide dog.

      "Italy is one country where beauty is prized more than any other virtue. That is, except in the small town of Piobbico, the self-declared World Capital of Ugly People. The road sign at the edge of the town even warns visitors that they are entering the ugly zone. People who consider themselves ugly have been gathering in Piobbico since the 1960s. That's when Ugly Club president Telesforo Lacobelli established a dating agency for women who believed they were too ugly to attract husbands. Lacobelli believes that he is ugly himself because he has a short nose in a country where long or large noses have always been considered beautiful.\nPeople from around the world travel to Piobbico to tell their sad stories of ugliness. During the annual Festival of the Ugly, which occurs on the first Sunday of every September, hundreds of people gather in Piobbico's town square to elect the president of the Ugly Club. Lacobelli wins the election every year. The Ugly Club has over 20, 000 members. They carry ID cards that grade their ugliness from bearable to extreme. A prize is awarded to Ugly Club members who qualify as extremely ugly.\nThe Ugly Club president insists that ugliness is a virtue. Since beautiful people get a lot of attention for their beauty alone, they have to work hard to prove their other virtues. Ugly people, on the other hand, are genuine and do not have to prove anything to anybody, according to Lacobelli.\nLacobelli is a spokesperson for ugly people everywhere. He believes that the uglier one is, the better life can be. Though the club enjoys making fun of beauty, especially beauty contests, Lacobelli has a serious side as well. He believes that too many people suffer from financial and emotional pressures because they don't meet society's standards of beauty. The fact that beautiful people are more successful in the workforce is a problem that Lacobelli has attempted to bring forward to the Italian public and government."

      "Not having done physical exercise for some time, I found myself a little low-spirited and couldn't study efficiently, so I decided to do some running the next day. At 6:15 the next morning, my alarm clock rang. Unwilling to rise from my bed, I turned it off and went back to sleep. However, 5 minutes later, I struggled to get up. After washing and brushing, I had my sneakers on and went out.\nWow! The air was so fresh that I couldn't help breathing it deeply. I stretched  my arms and legs, then started to run. I found all things around me were so attractive. Look, the branches were waving, as if they were welcoming me; the blossoming flowers were bowing, with shyness, just like girls. Listen, the wind was whispering, as if to say \"come on, girl\". What's more interesting was those two birds, perching in the tree. They were scared and flew away when I passed them. \"Hey, chaps, relax.\" I shouted without stopping running. \"Let's enjoy the beautiful morning together!\" Then miracle  happened. The two little creatures seemed to understand what I said. They turned back and twittered  around me. \"Are you singing for me?\" I asked. They twittered again and again, sounded like \"Yes\". I was delighted to hear that. Ah, what a wonderful morning and how beautiful life is!\nActually, there are a lot of charming things around us. Helen Keller wrote in her famous article Three Days to See, \" _ \". Indeed, many of us ignore the beauty around us, just because we are familiar with them. They always complain that life is boring. But, I just want to say, if you live each day with appreciation of things around, you'll find life is very charming. So, let's enjoy life from now on."

      "Where is that noise coming from? Not sure? Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. \nBlind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. \nPrevious studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. \nTwenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. the rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blind-folds. \nIn one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 metres away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. \nWhen sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. \nRecognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming.\nStill, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the working of brains of \"late-onset\" blind people."

      "Have you ever suddenly felt that someone you knew was in trouble--and was he? Have you ever dreamed something that came true later? Maybe you have ESP  .\nESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away.\nHere's an example. A woman was ironing clothes. Suddenly she screamed, \"My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!\" Just then, a telegram came. The woman's father died of a heart attack. He died sitting in a chair.\nThere are thousands of stories like this one on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what's behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example--one of hundreds of dreams that have come true:\nA man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, \"There's room for one more.\" The man felt the driver seemed dead, so he ran away. The next day, when the man was getting on a crowded bus, the bus driver said, \"There's room for one more.\"\nThen the man saw that the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into flames. Everyone was killed!\nSome people say stories like these are _ . Others, including some scientists, say that ESP is real. From studies of ESP, we may someday learn more about the human mind."

By 10:45 that night she was almost ready to go home when the phone rang.\nPicking it up, she heard a guard shouting. There is a fire! Get out of there.\nSkaar didn't panic. She figured that it was just a small fire. Her office building was huge. There were 62 floors and her desk was on the 37thfloor.\nSkaar called out to office mate Stephen Oksas, who also stayed late to work. But when they got out to the hallway, they were met by a cloud of black smoke. Rushing back, Skaar shut the door and filled the space at the bottom of the door with her jacket to keep the smoke out.\nThen they called 911. before they could call their families, however, the line went dead. That meant that they were completely cut off from the outside world. All they could do was wait and hope someone would come to rescue them.\nMinutes ticked by. Smoke began to float into the office. Soon it became hard for them to breathe.\nLooking around, Skaar noticed a small workroom. It seemed to have cleaner air. So they crowed there. That helped for a while, but in time even the workroom was filled with deadly smoke.\nHopeless, they tried to break the windows, but the glass was not breakable. Everything they threw at just bounced back.\nDefeated, they struggled back to the workroom. They felt weak and dizzy.

      "My student teaching experience was a wonderful adventure. I had to deal with various discipline and behavior challenges that occurred again and again.\nThe greatest part of it was the relationship I developed with two students. One of the students was named Michael,whom I met when I was working for a kindergarten. Before I became a morning bus assistant, I'd heard that Michael was a challenging student who would always shout, stand up on the bus, make fun of other students, and distract bus driver. So I decided that each morning, when he got on the bus, I'd have Michael sit beside me. At first he didn't like this idea and pouted about it. But soon he settled down, knowing he had no choice. I began to talk to him about little things outside of school life, such as his weekend activities and things that he liked to do. I also listened closely to him When he talked and thoroughly responded to his ideas. As I gave Michael the attention that he needed,little by little, he began to behave better and better. His transformation was noticed by all, by the students and especially the bus driver.\nAnother student I took a special interest in was a boy named Tony, a third grader. To some, Tony seemed to be a slow or passive learner. So I decided to see if I could find a way to motivate Tony to stay on the task. I would sit in the seat next to him and encourage him through every step of the work he was doing. This helped him to stay motivated and at least the work was getting down on time. Before long, he was paying more attention to his studies, and scoring high on all his tests. I knew that all Tony had needed was to be motivated on a one-on-one basis."

      "Immigration is the act of coming to a foreign country to live. The act of leaving one's country to settle in another is called emigration. Immigrants who flee their country because of persecution, war, or such disasters as famines or epidemics are known as refugees or displaced persons. Most people find it very hard to pull up roots in their native land and move to a strange country. But throughout history, countless millions of people have done so. The heaviest immigration worldwide took place from the early 1800's to the Great Depression, the economic hard times of the 1930's. In that period, about 60 million people moved to a new land. Most came from Europe. More than half immigrated to the United States. Other destinations included Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Today, the availability of fast, safe, and cheap transportation helps make migration easier. Asia is replacing Europe as the major immigrant-sending area. The United States remains the chief receiving nation.\nPeople abandon their homeland and move to another country for various reasons.\nThe main reason for immigration has long been economic opportunity----the desire for better land or a better job. During the 1800's, for example, the rich prairie land of the United States attracted many European farmers. Today, professional people commonly emigrate because of better opportunities elsewhere. Such emigration has sometimes been called brain drain. Many doctors and nurses and numerous engineers and scientists have moved to the United States.\nReligious persecution has led many people to move to a new land for the freedom to practice their faith. Such immigrants include Jews expelled from England in the 1200's.\nWars, revolutions, and political unrest have driven innumerable people to find new homes. In the 1990's alone, millions of refugees fled from warfare in Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia, Iran, Uganda, Southeastern Asia, and Central America.\nSome immigrants were brought to a new land against their will. From the 1500's to the 1800's Europeans shipped black Africans to the Western Hemisphere as slaves. The United Kingdom transported prisoners to Australia from the late 1700s to the 1860s to relieve over crowding in British jails. Before that time, the United Kingdom sent prisoners to the American colonies.\nImmigrants have made enormous contributions to the culture and economy of such nations as Australia, Canada, New Zealand the United States. But their accomplishments have been made with great difficulty. At times, the United States, like many receiving countries, has restricted immigration to maintain a more homogeneous society in which all the people share the same ethnic, geographic, and cultural background. Although some immigration laws have been relaxed, many new comers of different backgrounds still face challenges in gaining acceptance."

      "\"Regardless of social class, race and age, men say they hate to shop.\" says Zukin, City University of New York sociology professor. Yet when you ask them deeper questions, it turns out that they like to shop. Men generally like to shop for books, music and hardware. But if you ask them about the shopping they do for books or music, they'll say, \"Well, that's not shopping. That's research.\"\n    In other words, what men and women call \"buying things\" and how they approach that task are different. \n    Women will wander through several 1,000-aquare-meter stores in search of the perfect party dress. Men will wander through 100 Internet sites in search of the perfect digital camcorder. Women see shopping as a social event. Men see it as a special task or a game to be won. \n   \"Men are frequently shopping to win,\" says Ann, a marketing professor at Loyola University of Chicago. \"They want to get the best deal. They want to get the best one, the latest one and if they do that it makes them happy.\" When women shop, \"They're doing it in a way that they want everybody to be very happy.\" says Ann. \"They're kind of shopping for love.\"\n   \"Teenage girls learn to shop from their moms and older sisters, but they also learn to shop by examining articles in magazines like Seventeen,\" City University Zukin says. \"And although men's magazines such as GQ and Esquire have long had shopping articles, it's TV that has the eye of young male shoppers,\" say Ann and Zukin. \n   \"Television shows are used by young men in the same way Seventeen magazine or Lucky is used by girls,\" says Zukin, \"to help make clothing and toiletry choices.\"\n   \"Of course, there are men who love to shop and are proud of it.\" Loyola's Ann says. And that is important no matter whether you buy a car or a frying pan. All men love to buy but don't want to get cheated. Ann adds, \"There actually are men who are interested, for example, in cooking or shopping or chinaware or things around the home---they become kind of girl magnets. Women like it.\""

      "D\nThe year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet   is heading towards the Earth . Most of it will miss our planet , but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth .\nOn 17 July , a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere   with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed , but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound . The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed . Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole . The wall of water , a kilometer high , rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour . Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people re drowned .\nBefore the waves reach South America , the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina . Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains . The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean . The cities of Los Angeles , San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes . Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long . Because of the explosions , the sun is hidden by clouds of dust , temperatures around the world fall to almost zero .Crops are ruined . The sun won't be seen again for many years . Wars break out as countries fight for food . A year later , no more than 10 million people remain alive .\nCould it really happen ? In fact , it has already happened more than once in the history of the Earth . The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years . Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared . Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space . The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out . Will we meet the same end ?"

      "For some reason, it takes constant reminders that weprimates need nurturing.\nIn a recent study of 46 babychimpanzee orphans, Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues demonstrated that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better oncognitive tests than babies who receive only food, shelter, and friendship with peers. But this is not breaking mews. In fact, it's old news.\nIn the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.\nHarlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey \"mother\" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day.\nHarlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care \"experts\" and everybody's grandmother had a \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.\nThe current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action.\nThe highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test.\nSo we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time. And if we get that kind of connection, we are sure to be fine, even better than fine."

      "A cheap drug that can stop bleeding in people recently injured in an accident could potentially save the lives of tens of thousands worldwide, a new study says.\nResearchers studied the effects of tranexamic acid  , or TXA, in more than 10,000 injured people in 40 countries who received the drug within 8 hours of being injured. The study was published in the medical journalLancet.Doctors found that patients who got TXA had a 15percent lower chance of dying from _ than those who didn't get it . They also had a 10 percent lower chance of dying from any other cause, including organ failure and a head injury. The study was paid for by the British government.\nThe drug is commonly used in wealthy countries during elective surgeries  to stop bleeding , but isn't used for accident victims. TXA is off-patent and made by many companies. It costs about $4.5 per gram, and a typical dose is two grams. It is usually given via an injection  and would be relatively easy to introduce, even in poor countries, experts said.\nPrevious tests of the drug regarded its use in elective surgeries, such as heart operations, but this was the first study to test the drug on accident victims. Doctors were worried it might increase side effects such as blood clots  in the heart and lungs, strokes, or heart attacks. There was no evidence of that in theLancet study, though the authors said it was possible they might have missed some of these incidents.\nFor people between 5 and 45, accidents are the second leading cause of death worldwide after AIDS, and about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death every year. Experts estimated that if TXA were readily available, between 70,000 and 100,000 lives a year could be saved. Though the drug wasn't tested on children , experts said it would almost certainly work with them as well."

      "Teenagers are under a lot of pressure to be thin. They resort to starving, vomiting and eating only diet foods to try and be thin. Television is a big influence on them. They watch shows like Beverly Hills 90210 andMelrose Placeand feel they need to look as thin as the actresses on these shows. Society is brainwashing young people into believing that being thin is important and necessary.\nDiet commercials are constantly appearing on our television screens telling us that once we lose weight, we will be happy. While you're standing at the grocery store you are surrounded by magazines claiming to have the newest and best diet. Each month another new diet appears claiming to be the diet to end all diets. If diets really worked, then why are there so many of them? The reason a new diet pops up each month, is that last's month's diets did not work. The truth of the matter is that DIETS DON'T WORK.\nThe diet and fashion industries are not totally to blame for society's obsession with thinness. We are the ones keeping them in business. We buy into the idea that we can attain the \"ideal\" body image. We allow ourselves to believe the lies being thrown at us constantly. We are throwing away our hard earned money trying to live up to the standards that society has set for us. It's unfortunate, but in today's society, people have forgotten that it's what's inside a person that counts, not what's on the outside. We need to start loving and accepting each other for who we are, not what we look like.\nOnce again, I would like to stress the fact that diets don't work. Eating three healthy meals a day, a few snacks and doing moderate exercise, will allow your body to go to its natural set point. Next time you decide that you are going to start another diet because you feel you are too fat, stop, sign up for a self-esteem class instead. That would be money well spent."

      "There is probably no field of human activity in which our values and lifestyles are shown more clearly and strongly than they are in the clothes that we choose to wear.The dress of an individual is a kind of \"sign language\" that communicates a set of information and is usually the basis on which immediate impressions are formed.Traditionally,a concern for clothes was considered to be an affair of females,while men took pride in the fact that they were completely lacking in clothes consciousness .\nThis type of American culture is by degrees changing as man dress takes on greater variety and color.Even as early as 1955,a researcher in Michigan said that _ White collar workers in particular viewed dress as a symbol of ability,which could be used to impress or influence others,especially in the work situation.The white collar worker was described as extremely concerned about the impression his clothing made on his superiors .Although blue collar workers were less aware that they might be judged on the basis of their clothing,they recognized that any difference from the accepted pattern of dress would be made fun of by fellow workers.\nSince that time,of course,the patterns have changed:the typical office worker may now be wearing the blue shirt,and the laborer a white shirt;but the importance of dress has not become less.Other researchers in recent years have helped to prove its importance in the lives of individuals at various age levels and in different social and economic status groups ."

      "Scientists are using a kind of eye-tracking equipment to learn how babies look at the world. In the lab, children 5 months and older crawl   and walk up, down and over adjustable wooden slopes  , gaps and steps.\nIt may seem like the set for a new reality television show, but there are no prizes, except perhaps for the researchers. They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines. The wearable eye-trackers that Dr. Adolph, Mr. Franchak and their colleagues use are based on equipment developed over the last decade by Positive Science, a New York company, with money from the United States Naval Research Laboratory. They were designed to help scientists. Eye-trackers are currently being used in studies to learn the differences in how amateur and professional geologists   scan landscapes and how people examine signs when looking for exits during emergencies.\nThe researchers also found that during the studies babies looked at their mothers just 16 percent of the time. \"That is lower than expected.\" Dr. Adolph said. A large body of past research has placed importance on children watching the faces of adults as they name objects to learn languages. These findings suggest children may not have to look very long to get the information they need, either from people or objects. This gives a new understanding of how much information they need, or how quickly children might process the information."

Finally they took Tommy to a catholic  school.\nAfter the first day, little Tommy came home with a very serious look on his face. He didn't kiss his mother hello. Instead, he went straight to his room and started studying. Books and papers were spread out all over the room and little Tommy was hard at work. His mother was surprised. She called him down to dinner and as soon as he finished eating, he went back to his room, without a word. In no time he was back hitting the books as hard as before. This went on for some time, day after day while the mother tried to understand what was happening.\nFinally, little Tommy brought home his report card. He quietly put it on the table and went up to his room and hit the books. His mom looked at it and to her surprise, little Tommy got an A in math. She could no longer hold her curiosity.

      "British MPs   have voted in favour of the creation of babies with DNA from two women and one man, in a historic move. The UK is now set to become the first country to introduce laws to allow the creation of babies from three people. In a free vote in the Commons, 382 MPs were in favour and 128 against the technique that stops genetic diseases being passed from mother to child. During the debate, ministers said the technique was \"light at the end of a dark tunnel\" for families.\nA further vote is required in the House of Lords. If everything goes ahead then the first such baby could be born next year. Supporters said it was \"good news for progressive medicine\" but critics say they will continue to fight against the technique that they say raises too many ethical   and safety concerns. Estimates suggest 150 three-person babies could be born each year.\nPrime Minister David Cameron said: \"We're not playing god here; we're just making sure that two parents who want a healthy baby can have one.\" The method, which was developed in Newcastle, should help women like Sharon Bernadi, from Sunderland, who lost all seven of her children to mitochondrial   disease. Ms Bernadi said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the decision.\nMitochondria are the tiny compartments   inside nearly every cell of the body that transform food into useable energy. They have their own DNA, which does not affect characteristics such as appearance. _ mitochondria are passed down only from the mother. They can lead to brain damage, muscle wasting, heart failure and blindness. The technique uses a modified version to combine the DNA of the two parents with the healthy mitochondria of a donor woman. It results in babies with 0.1% of their DNA from the second woman and is a permanent change that would be passed down through the generations."

      "What is the color1 of the universe? Astronomers had not answered this question until two months ago. That is when two American astronomers reported on their study of all the light in the universe. They said that the universe would appear to the human eyes to be a light greenish color1.\nKarl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, reported their finding in January. They presented the research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. They said that finding the color1 of the universe was not part of their more serious scientific research. They did it for fun.\nHowever, earlier this month, the scientists admitted making a mistake. They said their finding was much more color1ful than it should have been. They now say the light from our universe is closer to white. It is more like a milky or creamy white color1.\nTheir study attempted to show what people might see if they could observe the universe from far away. The scientists found the average color1 by combining light from about two-hundred-thousand star systems. Their information came from an observatory in New South Wales, Australia.\nThe scientists gave a number value to the color1s of the different star systems. Then they added the numbers together and found the average measurement. The scientists used this average to identify the color1 of the universe. They said it was a very pretty light green. Many newspapers and television stations reported their finding.\nOther scientists and color1 engineers attempted to reproduce the result. Mark Fairchild of the Rochester Institute discovered a mistake in the computer software program used by the Johns Hopkins scientists.\nWhen the mistake was corrected, the results changed. The new color1 of the universe is much less color1ful. It is very close to white."

      "Last week, I bought an alarm system  for about $ 450. It consisted of a control unit with three other small units. I put the control unit in the sitting room and fastened the other units by the front door, back door and living-room windows. The instructions told us to choose three numbers, so we chose 491, the last three numbers of our telephone number.\nNow I must explain how the alarm works:\n1. There is a power siren  in the control unit. It makes a very loud noise.\n2. Each of the small units sends out beams  or rays in different directions. If anything moves, it breaks a beam. This sends a signal to the control unit. The siren makes a noise that you can hear 50 meters away.\n3. When we go to bed, I press the three buttons numbered 4, 9 and 1. Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work.\nThat might I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar  could get into our house. However, at about 2:10a.m., I woke up and heard the siren .\n\"There must be a burglar in the house,\" Mary said. \"What shall we do?\"\n\"I'll go and see who's there,\" I said. \"Stay here. Don't make a noise.\"\nI went downstairs quietly. When I reached the living room, I switched on my torch and looked round the room. Then I turned the light on. I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs. There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked. I locked it, re-set the alarm and went back to bed.\nAbout an hour later, the alarm started again. I jumped out of bed, fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door. Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch. \"Hey! Wait a minute!\" I whispered. \"It's only me. I' m going downstairs to see what's wrong.\"\nI went down into the living room and listened for a moment. The only sound I could hear was the siren. I turned on the light and then switched the siren off. As I did so, I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows. I saw a house lizard   disappear behind the curtains.\n\"Oh!\" I said to myself. \"That's our burglar.\"\nWhen the lizard moved, it started the siren. I guessed that the alarm had been made in Europe, where there are no house lizards.\nWell, I won't finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge, let me know. I'll send you ours. We bought a dog this morning. It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar."

      "Vancouver. B.C.--For six months. Ted Schredd and Deanna Kopel cycled around North America to show others a way to help the environment. \"Nobody wants to breathe dirty air--but for the air to change. People have to stop driving cars,\" says Ted, \"If more people start riding bikes, the air will be cleaner.\"\nTed started his trip alone. He had $160 in his pocket and plans to cycle around North America. He left his hometown of Vancouver, and when he arrived in San Diego he got the chance to make some extra money for the rest of his 13, 000 km trip. A cyclist he met asked him to speak at an environment meeting in Texas. Within a few hours, Ted was on a plane to the meeting and a big surprise.\nWhen he met Deanna at the meeting, they talked for six hours straight. It was love at first sight. The next day, he called her to ask if she wanted to finish the trip with him. She said yes, sold everything in her flat, gave her notice at work, and was on the road with Ted three weeks later.\nDeanna found Ted's timetable difficult because he got up early in the morning. Deanna was a nurse and usually worked at night. \"All of a sudden, I was up at six when I wanted to sleep until noon,\" said Deanna.\nAs the couple cycled to Florida and up to Montreal and then back to Vancouver, every day was an adventure. They got free meals in restaurants, and slept in people's yards. When they ran out of money, people gave them extra cash.

      "Joe Temper should have known better. After all, he works for a large auto insurance company. It won't hurt to leave the key in the truck this once, he thought, as he filled his gas tank at a self-service gas station. But minutes later, as he was paying the money, he saw the truck being driven away.\nIn 2010, 1.6 million motor vehicles were stolen in the United States --one every 20 seconds. If present trends continue, experts predict vehicle thefts   could be over two million every year by the end of the decade.\nVehicle theft is a common phenomenon, which has a direct effect on over four million people a year. The cost is astonishing.\nMany police officials blame professional thieves for the large number of the thefts. It is a major moneymaker for organized crime. Typically, stolen cars are taken to pieces and the parts sold to individuals. But as many as 200,000 cars are smuggled    out of  the country every year. Most go to Latin America, the Middle East and Europe.\nOnly about 15 percent car thefts result in an arrest, because few police departments specially conduct in depth auto investigations. When thieves are arrested, judges will often sentence them to probation  , not immediately put them in prison because the prisons are overcrowded with violent criminals.\nOne exception is a Michigan program that calls for 92 police officers to work full time on the state's 65,000 car theft cases a year. Since 2006, when the effort began, the state's auto theft rate has fallen from second in the nation to ninth.\nHow can you protect your car? If you live in a high theft area or drive an expensive model, consider a safety system. It may cost anywhere from $ 25 to $ 1,000. Some systems work automatically - simply removing the key disables the fuel pump and the starter. When cars are equipped with such systems, thefts may drop by one third. In some states, you may be able to use a device that transmits radio signals, allowing stolen cars to be tracked by police."

I wish you enough too, Daddy.\" They kissed goodbye and she left.\n    He walked over toward the window where I was seated.

I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.

      "Hunan Satellite TV is losing its leading position? There's reason for saying this. In 2012, the reality talent show , the voice of China, on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China.\nThe reaon for its popularity was really because its excellent quality? Or can we assume that without any opponent, we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there's no comparison?\nThe administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the voice of China. In the past, there was no other draft shows  ranked as high as Super GirlandSuper Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out ture. All the other draft shows were shodowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012.\nAnd if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was \"no audition , no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion\", its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the voice of Chinawas permitted to be broadcast in prime time.\nIf you really think about it, there's no esential different between a draft show and the voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this were different from a draft show? No PK,really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And \"no rise in rank?\" is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really \"no champion\", how come there was only one \"good voice of China\" at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise .\nUnder such cimcumstance, the voice of Chinaeven got praise. We are not saying that it is not a good show: we are saying that there's regret about the show since it had no opponent."

      "Six seconds after its launch in Virginia, US, an unmanned rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) exploded, disappointing people both on Earth and in space.\nHundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct. 28 explosion due to An\"equipment failure\", said Orbital Sciences, the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission.\nThe rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2,200 kilograms of supplies such as food, tools, parts, and experiments. Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations. Some of them were from high school students in the US. For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  \"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .\nAstronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however. The cargo included 617kg of food. Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct. 29.\nLaunched in 1998 and involving the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the member countries of the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history. Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female. Three are from Russia, two are from the US, and one is from Germany.  They have lived together for about six months. The station gets regular resupplies from Earth, using unmanned spacecrafts. Food is always a big part of the supplies.  Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat, and often tastes bad-somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold.\nTo make space life better, however, scientists have made breakthroughs. Earlier this year, Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station. Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants. And, as transporting water to space is expensive, astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water. \"Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine<) ,\" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nIs that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?"

      "Spring is here and so is the cycling season. Here are some tips on how to do it safely and comfortably.\nWatch your feet--Pushing with the wrong part of the foot can raise your risk of developing a painful injury of the heel and arch , says Rob Werstine, a sports physiotherapist and board member of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association.  You should push with the ball of your foot, he says.\nLayer up--While it's still cool, wear layers of clothing, with clothing close to the body that breathes and outer layers that do not absorb water. Go for bright colors that increase your visibility .\nBe reasonable--If you are just starting out and aren't in good shape, don't sign up for a 50-kilometre ride. And while cycling is great exercise for people who want to get into shape, if your doctor advises you not to do tiring exercise, cycling shouldn't be your starting position, Werstine says. Walk to begin getting into shape and then graduate to cycling.\nFix the fit--If you develop lower back pain or numbness in your hands and fingers from cycling, it could be your bike isn't adjusted properly for your height. A good cycle shop can help you find the right height for the seat and handlebars, but if you have continuing problems, consider consulting a bike fit physiotherapist, Werstine says.\nBe mindful--You have to pay attention on the roads to vehicles, other cyclists and pedestrians .Consider taking a cycling safety course to practise your skills. Or do some reading about how to avoid dangerous cycling situations. bicyclesafe.com, for instance, lists 10 types of car-bike accidents and how to avoid them."

      "People want action on noise, a recent public meeting in Brisbane showed.Some want technical improvements such as quieter air conditioners or better sound barriers around major roads.Others want tougher laws to restrict noise from building sites or to require owners to take responsibility for barking dogs.But the highest priority was a noise complaints system that works.\nBrisbane City Council receives more complaints about noise than all other problems put together.So it conducted a survey and found that about half its residents are upset by noise in one form or another -traffic, mowers, pool pumps, air conditioners or loud parties.This inspired the Council to bring together more than 100 citizens one evening to talk through a range of options.\nThe meeting found the present regulatory system bizarre.Depending on the problem, responsibility for noise can lie with the Council, the Environment Protection Authority, one of three government departments or even the police.So complainants often feel they are getting the run-round.When the people at the forum were asked to vote for changes, the strongest response was for a 24-hour noise hotline to be the first part of call for all complaints.\nThe forum also favored regulatory measures, such as tougher minimum standards for noise in appliances like air conditioners.This even makes economic sense, as noise is a waste of energy and money.Other measures the meeting supported were wider buffer   zones around noisy activities and controls to keep heavy traffic away from residential areas.\nBut there are obvious conflicts.Many people like to have a bar within walking distance if they feel like a drink, but they don't want a noisy pub keeping them awake when they want an early night.Most people want to live near a major road providing good access to other parts of the city, but they don't' want the problem of road noise.\nI was most interested by the proposals aimed at behavioral change.There was strong support for measures to reduce traffic: better public transport, cycle ways and footpaths, even charges for road use.Many people optimistically thought industry awards for better equipment would stimulate the production of quieter appliances.It was even suggested that noise from building sites could be alleviated   if Brisbane adopted daylight saving, thus shifting the working day and providing longer, quieter evenings."

      "Nowadays everybody seems to think that they know English. Many people speak it but few speak it really well. Practice is necessary in speaking English well.\nReading is also one of the things that will help you to speak English better. Read whenever you can and whatever you like! Read papers and Internet sites that you like in English every day. Then, you will see that the number of known words is increasing and you are able to speak with more skills. Then you will have made the foundations and a good basis of English. It is not good to stop and get stuck there.\nGoing to England or an English speaking country is a good choice, but many people cannot afford it. If you cannot go, reading and speaking with your friends will also help you to practice your English. However, I think that it is very good to visit some English speaking country to see and test your knowledge in everyday life. You will feel the everyday usage of the language in its natural environment. There your level of English is going to improve even faster. Your ability to speak English is better. Nothing can match the excitement and happiness when a native speaker tells you that your English is very good!\nFinally, in order to speak English well, you must be persistent and do it every day. It is like playing the piano. Pianists play it every day and so should you. Include English in your life and you will see where it is going. Practice, practice! Read, write and improve your language skills and you are on your way when you will be able to speak it with more and more confidence!"

      "Family Vs Technology\nModern technology certainly changes family behavior, but does it really damage family life as many people fear? Not necessarily, says Dr. Silva, a professor in Sociology  at the Open University, she also argues it is wrong to assume technology erodes(,) the quality of family life.\n\"There is the idea that technology has an influence on the family and the family suffers. My take is quite different,\" she explains. \"Technological change happens because people's lives change. And it is people's choices of how to live that creates processes of innovation  as well. The family has a role like the economy or like technology itself in changing the world. The imagination is important in driving the things technologists want to find for our daily lives. People desire to see nature as it is, so color television comes about,\" she says.\nIn another case, the increase in working mothers helped create a market for labor-saving kitchen equipment. \"The time that women have to shop every day for food is no longer available so there is a need to have a refrigerator for food storage,\" says Dr. Silva. \"The need to cook that food more easily and quickly, means you have developments in cooking technology like the microwave oven . The microwave oven already existed because it was developed for the navy during World War Two but it wasn't used in ordinary families until the early 1980s.\n\"Technologies for housework were as important as those for work itself,\" she says, \"So washing machines, refrigerators and microwave ovens are terribly important. We couldn't imagine what life would be like if we didn't have them.\" Technological changes in the kitchen have played an important role in the changes of family behavior, creating a new social focus in the home.\n\"With advanced technology, you can feed the family in an easier manner. People can do housework with less difficulty. But that doesn't mean that family practices are not important -- it's just a different way of doing things.\""

      "Most painters discover a style of painting that is fit for them and stick to that, especially if people admire their pictures. But Picasso, the great Spanish painter, was like a man who had not yet found his own particular style of painting. He kept on struggling to find the perfect expression till his death in 1973.\nSome of Picasso's painting are rich, soft color1ed and beautiful. Others are ugly and cruel and strange. But such paintings allow us to imagine things for ourselves. They force us to say to ourselves,\"What does he see that makes him paint like that?\" And we begin to look under the surface of the things we see..\nPicasso painted thousands of pictures in different styles. Sometimes he painted the natural look of things. Sometimes he seemed to break them apart and throw the pieces in our faces. He showed us what the mind knows as well as what the eyes see. At the age of 90,he remained as curious about the world as he had been when he was young. That is why people have called him \"the youngest painter in the world.\""

      "The idea of light pollution has developed with the increase of lights in cities. In many areas, this light makes it difficult or impossible to observe stars and planets in the night sky.\nThere are a number of reasons why light pollution is important. One has become clear at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, California. Today, light from Los Angeles makes the night sky above Mount Wilson very bright. It is no longer an important reasearch center because of light pollution.\nLight pollution threatens to reduce the scientific value of research telescoples in other important observatories. They include Lick Observatory near San Jose, California and Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Illionis.\nLight pollution is the result of wasted energy. Bright light that shines into the sky is not being used to provide light where it is needed on Earth. Poorly designed lighting causes a great deal of light pollution. Lights that are brighter than necessary also cause light pollution.\nMost people in America are surprised to find out that they are able to see our own galaxy ,the Milky Way, with their own eyes. But about threefourths of Americans cannot see the Miky Way because of manmade light.\nObjects in the night sky are resources that provide everyone with wonder.

      "When was the last time someone did something unexpectedly nice for you? Not someone you knew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out.\nA few years ago, I was dining out with a person who kept going on and on about himself, completely unaware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery . It wasn't his company that disappointed me. I was recovering from a bad grade in my study. I could have collapsed in tears right there at the table.\nWhen we picked up the check, the waitress said, \"Your meal was already paid for.\" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man coming in out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a glass of wine, stayed for maybe ten minutes and then left. The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.\"\nJust last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it \"hitting the wall\"; I thought I couldn't move another muscle. Out of nowhere, a teenager jogged up next to me and said, \"What's your name sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day. He was running in place of someone else.\nI still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of need. Do you have any experiences like this?"

      "Many facts suggest that children are overweight and the situation is getting worse, according to the doctors. I feel there are a number of reasons for this.\nSome people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty foods, such as fried chicken and ice cream, at low prices. This has turned out a whole generation of grown-ups who seldom cook a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then probably children would buy less take-away food.\nThere is another argument that blames parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I agree with this, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food shops. If children are given fried chicken and chocolate rather than healthy food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives.\nThere is a third reason for this situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play computer games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime , it also gives them time to eat more unhealthy food.What they need is to go outside and play active games or sports.\nThe above are the main reasons for this problem, and therefore we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as _ them away from fast food shops and bad eating habits."

      "Your Car Is Ready for Take-off\nThe flying car has been talked about for many years,but now it appears that the idea is about to become a reality.\nAn international company has built a two-seater plane that, at the touch of a button ,transforms into a car perfectly suitable for driving on public roads. It has been designed so that the wings fold up automatically; and it takes just 15 seconds to switch between flying and driving. With its wings fully open and the propeller spinning, it can take off from any airfield.\nFlying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city,and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.\n\"The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. \"I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.\nNevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.\nThe flying car will cost around $ 200.000. \"For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,\" explains Alan. \"But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. \"\nThis latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel. It will become no more expensive than driving your car on the motorway. Travel time could be reduced by more than half.\nSo the next time you are told to fasten your seat belt, it may be to prepare for take-off."

      "Kodak's decision to apply for bankruptcy protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated  the film market for decades, but finally failed to adapt to the digital revolution. \nAlthough many attribute Kodak's downfall to \"complacency  ,\" that explanation doesn't admit the efforts with which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to focus on its traditional film business. \nLarge companies have a difficult time switching into new markets. For example, although Kodak predicted the rise of digital photography, its culture was too rooted in the successes of the past to fully welcome the future. In the past, their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. \nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. The 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which weaken Kodak by offering lower prices. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major loss. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited  its sponsorship to win a key role in the market."

      "A recent online poll   asked kids what they hated most about school. \"Classes are boring\" came in first. \"Too much homework\" was a close second. Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.\nPeople who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects. They claim it can help students develop good study habits. Homework can help students recognize that learning can occur at home as well as at school. It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved. They can put too much pressure on their kids.\nSo what should be done? Good homework assignments in the proper amount will have positive effects. Too much homework, however, will have negative effects. The bottom line: Students in grades three through six should do no more than 30 to 60 minutes of homework each night."

      "Think of London and you're likely to think of the city's famous bright red double-deckers buses. Think of Thailand's capital city, Bangkok, and the noisy tuk-tuk ( ) may come to mind. Picture the American city of San Francisco and you might see the city's trolleybuses.\nImagining what these cities would look like without their red buses, tuk-tuks or trolleybuses is difficult. They are symbols of these cities that make them different from anywhere else in the world. However, these city symbols, which are so loved by tourists, are not always so well loved by their city leaders. City leaders want what is best for their city, which often means the most modern transport.\nIn Thailand, Bangkok city authorities have forbidden new tuk-tuks because they consider them noisy and polluting. However, the ban has largely been unsuccessful, as it has not changed Thai people's preference for the inexpensive tuk-tuks over taxis.\nIn London, the city's first ever mayor got rid of the red double-decker buses, which he thought were old-fashioned, by selling them to other countries. His plan worked, but Londoners were upset to lose the charming old buses they believed represented the best of their city. They made their upset felt, when the major came up for re-election last year. Most Londoners voted for his competitor who promised to bring the bus back. Now an improved version of the double--decker bus will hit London's streets in 2012..\nAs for San Francisco, several trolleybuses remain in use but mainly as tourist attractions. They are too slow to be used for anything other than scenic trips.\nCity transport symbols may have a place in their city people's hearts, but it seems they are increasingly out of step with the modern world. As Londoners have proved, their continued life depends on people's willingness to fight for their survival."

      "Music for Humans and Humpback Whales\nAs researchers conclude in Science, the love of music is not only a universal feature of the human species, but is also deeply fixed in complex structures of the human brain, and is far more ancient than previously suspected.\nIn the articles that discuss the field of bio-musicology, the study of the biological basis for the creation and appreciation of music, researchers present various evidence to, show that music-making is at once an original human \"business\", and an art form with skillful performers throughout the animal kingdom.\nThe new reports stress that humans hold no copyright on sound wisdom, and that a number of nonhuman animals produce what can rightly be called music, rather than random sound. Recent in-depth analyses of the songs sung by humpback whales show that, even when their organ would allow them to do otherwise, the animals _ the same choices relating to sounds and beauty, and accept the same laws of song composition as those preferred by human musicians, and human ears, everywhere.\nFor example, male humpback whales, who spend six months of each year doing little else but singing, use rhythms   similar to those found in human music and musical phrases of similar length--a few seconds. Whales are able to make sounds over a range of at least seven octaves  , yet they tend to move on through a song in beautiful musical intervals, rather than moving forwards madly. They mix the sounds like drums and pure tones in a ratio   which agrees with that heard in much western music. They also use a favorite technique of human singers, the so-called A-B-A form, in which a theme is stated, then developed, and then returned to in slightly revised form.\nPerhaps most impressive, humpback songs contain tunes that rhyme. \"This suggests that whales use rhyme in the same way we do: as a technique in poem to help them remember complex material,\" the researchers write."

Complete with a timer, a whistle and 50 willing singles, speed dating is not the traditional dinner and a movie type of first date. Singles pay US $35 for three minutes with more than two dozen future dates. They ask questions and try to get to know each other. At the sound of a whistle, they do the same thing all over again--25 times in all.\nLock and key party\nWomen are given a lock and men are given a key, upon arriving at the party. Each key and lock has several matches. One can hunt for his/her later-to-be sweetheart in various groups, and try out the key or lock. Each time a lock and key match the pair are entered into a ballot  for top prizes!\nDinner in the dark\nWaiters wearing night vision glasses guide the guests through the pitch-black dining room. They are seated at the table and familiarized with the wine glass and plate. Food is handled with the fingers. People will not see the food they are eating or the guests at their table until the dessert course. At that moment, dining partners will appear.\nMessage party\nHave A Cocktail, Leave A Message! When you arrive, you get a tag with a number and a pad of post-it notes. If you see someone you like, write a message on the message board. But wait... You've got a message... Go and collect it!

      "Thomas Brodie-Sangster's cars and action figures weren't just toys. \"They would always be characters, and I would always put on stupid voices,\" says Thomas (Born on 16 May 1990). For him, acting was just a matter of moving childhood games to a set.\nMaturity and independence came to Thomas early as he started work at ten. After his first audition  , he learned about _ . Though hurt and disappointed, he took a part in a tiny, unknown TV film in 2001. No one noticed his performance - no one except screenwriter Richard Curtis. Two years later, he played Sam, a twelve-year-old in love in Curtis's Love Actually. After that hit film, he played actor Colin Firth's son in Nanny McPhee. Firth then joined a film called The Last Legion and supported Thomas for its lead role. As a result, the boy played Rome's final ruler in the action-adventure.\nAt about 16, Thomas had to make a decision. Did he really want to devote his life to acting? Many people in the public \"aren't letting you be you because they see you as something special\", he says. Also, friendship made during filming was often broken soon after the project finished. Despite these things, he found enough joy and satisfaction in the work to continue. Actually, Thomas seems to find joy in difficulty itself. He played 10-year-old Adolf Hitler in a TV movie and a teenage Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy. The subject of his film Death of a Superhero made it his most challenging film. Still, he found a positive message in its story of a schoolboy with cancer.\nThomas now enjoys roles in Game of Thrones and the upcoming Maze Runner films. Popular as those projects may be, most still recognize him as Sam in Love Actually. Sam seems to run after Thomas, just as he ran through Heathrow airport to his sweetheart."

Well, I'd like to tell you that there is no polite way to talk about this situation with your boss. After all, you are not one-hundred-percent sure that she is actually job-hunting. Even if you know for sure that she is, you can't, because it's not your business. Still, there are a couple of things that you can do to put yourself in a good position in case your boss does _ in the near future.\nFirst, you can have a general conversation with her about your career plans. Say something like, \"You've always been supportive of me, Stephanie, and I'd love you to give me some advice on my professional development.\" This will let your boss know that you're ready for a new challenge. Ask her to give you feedback about how she thinks you can improve as a future leader.\nSecond, ask for your manager's approval   to talk with the training department about any program the company offers. There may or may not be any training, but making the request will still communicate your desire to get into a people-management role.\nThird, you could say to your boss, \"If there is anything you need my help with, I'd love it if you let me know. I am very interested in supporting you with anything you want to hand off.\"\nTaking those three steps will make it clear to Stephanie that you're ready to be her No. 2.\nBest regards,\nLiz"

      "Most people know that awkward feeling when you step into an elevator with other people and try not to make eye contact.\nBut new research suggests it may be down to a subconscious power struggle being played out as you make your way up or down.\nA study found that people decide where they stand based on a micro social grading, established within seconds of entering the lift.\nRebekah Rousi, a Ph.D. student in cognitive science, conducted an study of elevator behaviour in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide, Australia.\nAs part of her research, she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings, and discovered there was an established order to where people tended stand.\nIn a blog, she writes that more senior men seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins.\nShe said: 'In front of them were younger men, and in front of them were women of all ages.'\nShe also noticed there was a difference in where people directed their stare half way through the ride.\nMen watched the monitors , looked in the side mirrors (in one building) to see themselves, and in the door mirrors (of the other building) to also watch others.\n'Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation) and the mirrors,' she writes.\nThe student concluded it could be that people who are shyer stand toward the front, where they can't see other passengers, whereas brave people stand in the back, where they have a view of everyone else."

      "This girl is almost without shelter. She may not realize it, but she's more exposed to the world than she's ever likely to be again. And it isn't because she's a girl. It could be a boy. It could be you.\nBut why is she 'shelter less ? She s got a place to live in quite a pleasant place by the look of it and if shelter .\nDoesn't' t mean a house, then what does it mean? When we say someone \"lives a sheltered life\" , we don't only mean that their house is comfortable. We mean that they're protected from too many worries and troubles, that they live in a settled home, probably surrounded by friends and family, and that they don't have to cope with the difficulties the world is full of alone.\nCertainly no one would say that this girl was leading a sheltered life; she's leaving home to earn her living in a strange city and live by herself in a bed sitter. She may be just as well protected physically as a \"sheltered life\" person, but she's lost all the other shelters in her life--family, friends, the home she grew up in, school, the groups she belonged to. She s on her own now and unless she's very self-reliant , she's likely to feel unhappy and insecure at times.\nA young person setting out on her own like this is between the two main kinds of shelter most of us spend our lives in. One is our parents home where we grow up, and the other is the home we make ourselves and where we bring up our own children. For most people the time they spend between or outside these two shelters is only a small part of their lives."

      "After their 20-year-old son hanged himself during his winter break from the University of Arizona five years ago, Donna and Phil Satow wondered what signs they have overlooked, and started asking other students for answers.\nWhat grew from this soul searching was Ulifeline (www. Ulifeline. org), a Web site where students can get answers to questions about depression by logging on through their universities. The site has been adopted as a resource by over 120 colleges, which can customize it with local information, and over 1.3 million students have logged on with their college ID's.\n\"It is a very solid Web site that raises awareness of suicide, de-stigmatizes mental illness and encourages people to seek the help they need,\"said Paul Grayson, the director of counseling services at New York University, which started using the service nearly a year ago.\nThe main component of the Web site is the Self-screening program developed by Duke University Medical Center that tests students to determine whether they are at risk for depression, suicide and disorders like anorexia and drug dependences. Besides helping students, the services compiles anonymous student date, offering administrators an important window onto the mental health of its campus.\nThe site provides university users with links to local mental health services, a catalog of information on prescription drugs and side effects, and access to Go Ask Alice, a vast archive developed by Columbia University with hundreds of responses to anonymously posted inquires from college students worldwide. For students concerned about their friends, there is a section that describes warning signs for suicidal behavior and depression.\nYet it is hard to determine how effective the service is. The anonymity of the online service can even play out as a negative. \"There is no substitute for personal interaction ,\" said Dr. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, based in Washington.\n _ \"The purpose is to find out if there are signs of depression and then direct people to the right places,\" said Ron Gibori, executive director of Ulifeline.\nMrs. Satow, who is still involved with Ulifeline, called it \"a knowledge base\" that might have prevented the death of her son, Jed. \"If Jed's friends had known the signs of depression, they might have seen something,\" she said."

      "For most of us, the rain that falls on our roof runs off into the ground or the sewer  system. But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ \nAccording to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.\nPlants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.\nRainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.\nMany varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier. Most garden centres offer a range of choices as well as tips."

      "Wal-Mart is not just the world's largest retailer  . It's the world's largest company, which sells in three months what number-two retailer Home Depot sells in a year.\nWal-Mart exercises its power for just one purpose: to bring the lowest possible prices to its customers. At Wal-Mart, that goal is never reached. The retailer has a clear policy for suppliers: On basic products that don't change, the price Wal-Mart will pay, and will charge shoppers, must drop year after year. But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and none of its 21,000 suppliers know is the high cost of those low prices. To survive in the face of its pricing demands, makers of everything from bikes to jeans have had to close US plants in favor of obtaining products from abroad.\nIndeed, the real story of Wal-Mart, the story that never gets told, is the story of the pressure the biggest retailer constantly applies to its suppliers in the name of bringing us \"every day low prices\".\nThe giant retailer' s low prices often come with a high cost. Wal-Mart' s pressure can crush the companies it does business with and force them to send jobs overseas. Are we shopping our way straight to the unemployment line? Of course, US companies have been moving jobs offshore for decades, long before Wal-Mart was a retailing power. But there is no question that the chain is helping accelerate the loss of American jobs to low-wage countries such as Thailand.\nPeople ask, \"How can it be bad for things to come into the US cheaply?\" Sure, it's great to have bargains. But you can' t buy anything if you' re not employed.\nThere is no question that Wal-Mart's drive to squeeze out cost has benefited consumers. By now, it is accepted wisdom that Wal-Mart makes the companies it does business with more efficient and focused. Wal-Mart itself is known for continuous improvement in its ability to handle, move, and track goods. It is legendary   for forcing its suppliers to redesign everything from their packaging to their computer systems. It is also legendary for quite straightforwardly telling them what it will pay for their goods."

      "Sociable   people seem to gain extra rewards from their relationships by feeling less stressed, taking better care of themselves and having less risky lifestyles, they claim. \n     A review of studies into the impact of relationships on health found that people had a 50% better survival rate if they belonged to a wider social group. Psychologist Holt-Lunstad's team reviewed 148 studies that observed the social activities and health of 308,849 people over an average of 7.5 years. \n     From these they worked out how death rates varied depending on how sociable a person was. Being lonely and isolated was as bad for a person's health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being an alcoholic. It was as harmful as not exercising and twice as bad for the health as being very fat. \n     Holt-Lunstad said friends and family can improve health in lots of ways, from help in tough times to finding meaning in life. \"When someone is connected to a group and feels responsibility to other people, that sense of purpose and meaning translates to taking better care of themselves and taking fewer risks.\"\n     Holt-Lunstad said there was no clear figure on how many relationships are enough to improve a person's health, but people fared better when they rarely felt lonely and were close to a group of friends, had good family contact and had someone they could rely on and confide in."

      "American schoolchildren often wear uniforms if they attend religious or other private schools. Most public schools do not require uniforms. But over the last ten years or so, more of them have moved in that direction, including high schools. Students may have to wear a specially purchased uniform. Or they may just have to dress alike~for example, white shirts and dark color1ed pants or skirts.\nEven schools that do not require uniforms generally have a dress code or other rules about what they consider acceptable. Policies commonly ban clothing that shows offensive  images or words, or simply too much skin. Items like hats may be not permitted because ,for example, different color1s may be connected with violent gangs.\nSome parents like the idea of uniforms. They say it means they do not have to spend as much on clothing for their kids. Others, though, argue that uniforms represent an unnecessary cost There are also debates about whether uniforms or other dress policies break civil rights.\nStudents and parents have taken legal action against school dress requirements. Just last week, a judge blocked a middle school in Napa, California, from enforcing a dress code unless families have a way out of it The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California brought the case for the families of several students who werfe punished Most attention centered on a girl who wore socks with the Tigger character from Winnie the PooK\nThe school said its clothing policy, including no pictures of any kind, was needed to control a growing problem with gangs. The families argued that the policy went against free speech rights as guaranteed by the United States and California constitutions. The United States Supreme Court says student expression is protected as long as it does not harm the work and discipline of a school."

      "Growing up in Philadelphia, Lieberman started cooking with his stay-at-home dad when he was seven. His food-loving family had two kitchens, and he quickly learned what was the best way to bake his cakes. Lieberman improved his kitchen skills during a year abroad beforo college, learning from a cook in Italy and study local specialties in Gerrnany, Spain and France. At Yale,he was known for throwing dinner parties, single-handedly frying and baking while mixing drinks for dozens offriends. Just for fun, he and some friends decided to tape a show named Campus Cuisine about his cooking. Lieberman  was a real  college student showing his classmate how to do things like making drinks out of dining-hall fruit. That helped the show become very popular among the students. They would stop Lieberman after classes to ask for his advice on cooking. Tapes of the show were passed around,with which his name went beyond the school and finally to the Food Network.\nFood Network producer Flay hopes the young cook will find a place on the\nnetwork television. He says Lieberman's charisma is key.\"Food T-V isn't about\nfood anymore.\" says Flay, \" It's about your personality and finding a way to keep\npeople's eyeballs on your show.\"\nBut Lieberman isn't putting all his eggs in one basket.

      "Nowadays more and more people are talking about genetically modified foods ( GM foods). GM foods develop from genetically modified organisms  , which have had specific changes introduced into their DNA by genetic engineering techniques. These techniques are much more precise where an organism is exposed to chemicals to create a nonspecific but stable change. For many people, the hightech production raises all kinds of environmental, ethical, health and safety problems. Particularly in countries with long farming traditions, the idea seems against nature.\nIn fact, GM foods are already very much a part of our lives. They were first put on the market in 1996. A third of the corn and more than half the cotton grown in the U. S. last year was the product of biotechnology, according to the Department of Agriculture. More than 65 million acres of genetically modified crops will be planted in the US this year. _ .\nHowever, like any new product entering the food chain, GM foods must be subjected to careful testing. In wealthy countries, the debate about biotech is not so fierce by the fact that they have a large number of foods to choose from, and a supply that goes beyond the needs. In developing countries desperate to feed fastgrowing and underfed populations, the matter is simpler and much more urgent: do the benefits of biotech outweigh the risks?\nThe statistics on population growth and hunger are disturbing. Last year the world's population reached 6 billion. The UN states that nearly 800 million people around the world are unhealthy. About 400 million women of childbearing age don' t have enough iron, which means their babies are exposed to various birth defeats.As many as 100 million children suffer from vitamin A deficiency, a leading cause of blindness.\nHow can biotech help? Genetic engineering is widely used to produce plants and animals with better nutritional values. Biotechnologists have developed genetically modified rice and they are working on other kinds of nutritionally improved crops. Biotech can also improve farming productivity in places where food shortages are caused by crop damage attributable to drought, poor soil and crop viruses."

      "\"Our aim is to take our art to the world and make people understand what it is to move,\" said David Belle, the cofounder of parkour  .\nDo you love running? It is a good exercise, yet many people find it boring. But what if making your morning jog a creative one?Like jumping from walls and over gaps and ground rolls? Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale? Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over _ on the way. It is just because of Bond's wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.\nYes, that's parkour, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to another as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body. Parkour is considered an extreme sport. As its participants dash around a city, they may jump over fences, run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop.\nParkour can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds,but its participants see parkour much more than that.\nOvercoming all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy   behind parkour. This is the same as life. You must determine your destination, go straight, and jump over all the barriers as if in parkour and never fall back from them in your life, to reach the destination successfully. A parkour lover said,\"I love parkour because its philosophy has become my life, my way to do everything.\"\nAnother philosophy we've learnt from parkour is freedom. It can be done by anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world. It is a kind of expression of trust in yourself that you earn energy and confidence."

See how happy that person gets.\nSay you just got a box of chocolate. Which piece do you pick first? A man has studied people's choices. He says they tell something about the person. Did you choose a round piece? You are a person who likes to party. Did you choose an oval   shape? You are a person who likes to make things. Picking a square shape shows something else. The person is honest and truthful. You can depend on him or her.\nWhat kind of chocolate do you pick? Maybe you like milk chocolate. This shows you have warm feelings about the past. Dark chocolate means something else. A person who chooses it looks toward the future. What about white chocolate? Would you choose it? If so, you may find it hard to make up your mind. Some people like chocolate with nuts  . These are people who like to help others.\nDo you believe these ideas? Can candy tell all these things? It doesn't really matter.

      "For many American teenagers, having a part-time job is an important part of growing up. A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job. Still, many American teenagers value their work experience and the skills they gain on the job."

That is why the word \"heart\" is used in so many expressions about emotional situations.\nOne such expression is to \"lose your heart\" to someone. When that happens, you have fallen in love.

In your pain and sadness, you may decide that the person you love is \"hard-hearted\", and in fact, has a \"heart of stone\".\nYou may decide to \"pour out your heart\" to a friend. Telling someone about your personal problems can often make you feel better.\nIf your friend does not seem to understand how painful your broken heart is, you may ask her to \"have a heart\". You are asking your friend to show some sympathy  for your situation.

      "It is well-known that the \"prom\", a formal dance held at the end of high school or college, is an important date in every student's life. What is less well-known is that the word \"prom\" comes from the verb \"to promenade\", which means to walk around, beautifully dressed, in order to attract attention. The idea is that you should see and be seen by others.\nThe prom is not just an American tradition, though most people believe that it started in America. In Canada the event is called a \"formal\". In Britain and Australia the old fashioned word \"dance\" is more and more frequently being referred to as a \"prom\". Most countries have some form of celebration when students finish high school: after all, it means the end of life as a child, and the beginning of life as an adult.\nThe prom is expensive to organize and the tickets can cost students a lot of money. The tradition is that students themselves have to raise the money to pay for it. Selling the students newspapers is one way to raise money; so is taking a part-time job at the weekend.\nAlthough the prom should be the experience of a lifetime, it also worries many students. There is the problem of what to wear, who to take as your partner, who will be voted \"prom queen\", etc. And it is not only students who feel worried. What many parents find difficult is the realization that their children's school days are almost over. However, for most people at the prom, once the music starts playing, everyone relaxes and stops worrying."

      "How much should you save? You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase , wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a $20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store. It works for me.\nThese ideas should help you get started. If you have some questions about anything you've read here, or would like to share your ideas about saving money, please write to us."

      "\"Make-A-Wish\" is one of the world's most well-known charities . It makes wishes come true for children who have serious illnesses. It gives them hope and joy and helps them forget about their health problems and have fun.\nIt all started in 1980 in Phoenix,Arizona.Christopher was a 7-year-old boy who was very sick. He always dreamed of becoming a police officer.Tommy Austin and Ron Cox,two police officers, made his wish come true. They gave Cristopher a tour of the city  in a police helicopter( )and made a real police uniform for him.\nThere are four kinds of wishes children usually have:\nI wish to go. Children ueually want to travel or go to a concert ,a game or a park.\nI wish to meet. Children sometimes want to meet their favourite actors,singers or players.\nI wish to be. Some children wish to become actors,singers or police officers.\nI wish to have. They often want to have a computer, a game, a bike or many other things.\nLet's hope more wishes will come true in the future.People who work in the charity always try for the best.Almost 25,000 volunteers help,work or give money.

      "A recent study offers a picture of how dangerous it is to get a lift from a teenage driver. Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone. However, the possibility of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional (added) passenger.\nIt was also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased greatly after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late night accident.\nRobert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to help solve the problem is to have states setting up so-called graduated licensing systems . A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove that he/she is able to drive in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with a limited number of passengers, before graduating to full driving on his own. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place. The systems have reduced teenage driver crashes , according to recent studies."

      "When the Audet family turns on the lights at Blue Farm, they are using electricity that comes from cows--cow manure  , to be specific.\nCows produce a lot of wastes. One cow can create 30 gallons of wastes each day. Now imagine the output of over 1,000 cows at Blue Farm. That's really a big amount.\nWhen farmers clean their barns, they put the wastes in a big heap, and spread some of them on their fields for fertilizer . But now places like Blue Spruce Farm have a new way of using cow wastes. They use them to produce electricity.\nHere's how it works: A big machine moves back and forth cleaning the barn floor. \"The cows aren't bothered,\" says Marie Audet. \"They are animals of habit; they get used to it, and just lift one foot and then another to let it go by.\"\nThe machine pushes the manure into a big 600-gallon tank like a small swimming pool. The tank is called a digester   because what happens there is just like what happens inside a cow: Bacteria  get to work and continue to digest the manure.\nMethane gas (, )in the atmosphere is known as a \"greenhouse\" gas because it keeps heat just like a greenhouse does, causing our planet to warm up. That's an environmental concern. But the digester has a good result. Its gas is kept and used to power electric generators  .\nAt Blue Farm, the generators make enough electricity to power 400 homes. The Audet family sells the extra electricity they can't use themselves."

      "Dear Boris,\nThanks for your nice letter.\nAfter I had spent a week with my English family, I slowly began to understand their English a little better. It's very different from what I learned at school! Students in my group are from different cities of Britain and their dialects   are different too! Some of their accents   are quite strong and they also have their own words and expressions.\nBut it's not the language that's different and surprising. Before I came to England I had thought that fish and chips were eaten every day. That's quite wrong! I get rather mad now when I hear all the foolish words about typical   English food.\nI had expected to see \"London fog\". Do you remember our texts about it? We had no idea that most of this 'thick fog' disappeared many years ago when people stopped using coal in their homes. But the idea to speak about the weather was very helpful. The weather in London is really changeable.\nOn the other hand habits are different. People tell me what is typically British here in London is not always typical in Wales or Scotland. Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions. Probably Britain has more living signs of its past than many other countries. And people have always been proud of having ancient buildings in capitals, big cities and the countryside.\nI will tell you more about Britain in my other letters.\nLove from Britain,\nPeter"

      "Can plants eat people? Probably not, but there are many plants that eat meat. Some of them are big. And they can eat small animals. One famous meat-eating plant is the Venus flytrap .\nThe Venus flytrap is a very strange plant. It grows in dry parts of the United States. Its leaves are like the pages of a book. They can open and close very quickly. Inside the leaves, there are three small hairs. If a fly touches one of the hairs, the leaf closes quickly. The fly cannot get out. In about half an hour, the leaf _ the fly until it is dead. Then, the plant covers the fly. Slowly, the plant eats the fly.\nWhy do plants do it? Most plants get what they need from the sun, the air, and the ground. In some places, the ground is very poor. It doesn't have all these important things, especially nitrogen .

      "For many years, a small percentage of homeowners have fixed solar panels   on their rooftops. Those panels collect some of the sun's energy and either change it into electricity or use it to heat water. Until recently, the panels were too expensive for average homeowners, and their designs were not attractive. Thanks to new advances, however, solar panels for homes are becoming cheaper and less large and heavy. Now more homeowners are considering using them.\nStores begin to sell Solar panels\nLast fall furniture retailer  IKEA began selling solar panels in its U.K. stores. IKEA has brought the DIY solar choice to the public. While shopping for furniture, shoppers could not add a box or two of solar panels to their shopping cart  . IKEA is partnering with a company. The company deals with fixing and servcing of the solar panels on the roofs. So it is easy for customers to change from old energy system to solar system. If all goes well, IKEA plans to begin selling the panels in other countries soon.\nStylish solar panels\nSolTech, a Swedish company, offers a really great solar-power solution. Instead of flat panels, SolTech covers the panels with a special glass tile.  And the shape of the glass tile fits traditional tiled roof designs. SolTech recently offers solar systems that heat the home's air or water. And it also offers one solar system that produces electricity.\n _ \nNew technology has turned windows into solar panels. SolarWindow technology enables see-through windows to produce electricity after the glass surface is added with a special coating. Amazingly, SolarWindow can produce electricity in low-light conditons and can even turn indoor, man-made light into electricity! Since buildings are getting taller and about 60 percent of an office building's surface is covered with windows, solar window could become a very popular way for people to produce energy and save money.\nTurning your home -business-into a solar-powered one is a choice that's becoming a lot more attractive these days!"

He also wants to tell them that smoking doesn't make one look cool. Two national studies show that teenage smoking is down. Still, there is work to be done.\nSmoking is an unhealthy habit. It can cause heart disease, lung cancer and other serious illnesses. Just being around cigarette smoke can make you sick.\nIn the 1990s, all 50 states went to court to fight tobacco companies. The states won money from the companies. It helps to pay for anti-smoking groups, but the money is not enough.\nEach day, about 4,000 kids light up for the first time. \"We have to do a better job of stopping kids from smoking,\" says Husten. Ads that tell ugly facts about smoking help to change minds. Setting smoke-free areas in public places works too. Just this month, a California town _ smoking in all public places, such as schools, shopping malls and libraries. It may be bad news for smokers.

      "The corridor   windows at the Hangzhou Entel Foreign Language School look a bit different from other schools. They are all decorated   with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows.\nChen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers   or posters. Then I thought of replacing   them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said.\nTo Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows.\nIn fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display   wall to show students' works.\nThrough the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun. I can design my own patterns   and present interesting things through it,\" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies  .\nPaper cutting also helps students become more patient. Wang Yiyou, 12, was once an active boy. But now, he can carefully design a delicate   paper cutting work with scissors   and gravers  . \"I am so proud that I can make it look perfect,\" he said.\n(By Wu Qian, 21st Century Teens Staff)"

      "Walking is a popular form of exercise. It is an easy activity and offers a good way to improve physical fitness. Walking also gives many of the same benefits as other kinds of exercise.\nRegular, brisk walks help a person's body work better. Walking builds a stronger heart and lungs. Walking also seems to help protect the heart from heart disease. The lungs work better because they take in and use oxygen more effectively. Walking can help in weight control, too. A quick fifteen-minute walk burns as many calories as jogging the same distance in half the time. Walking causes very injuries, so there is also a lower \"dropout\" rate among walkers than among runners.\nPeople are more likely to continue a walking program. This gives a better chance for success. Walking offers some mental benefits, too. It seems to make people feel better. Many walkers say they sleep better at night when they take regular walks. Others say they have a better attitude towards life. Walking offers many of the same physical and mental benefits as other forms of exercise, but walking offers some special advantages, too. Almost everyone can walk. There are no special lessons or training. To become a real walker, a person only needs to walk faster, farther, and more often.\nPeople can walk almost anywhere. There are no special playing fields or courts for walking. Sidewalks, streets, parks, fields, and malls are excellent places for walking. People can walk almost anytime. A person doesn't need a team or a partner for walking. There is no \"season\" for walking. Most walkers walk in all kinds of weather.\nWalking doesn't cost anything. There are no special fees for walking. Good walking shoes and comfortable clothes are the only equipment that a walker needs.\nWalking offers a form of exercise within the reach of nearly everyone. With a little time and effort, people can rediscover a valuable form of exercise and improve their fitness."

      "Just as \"Tiger Mom\" leaves, here comes the \"Wolf Daddy\" called Xiao Baiyou. He believes he's the best parent in the world. Some days ago, Xiao Baiyou's latest book about how to be a successful parent came out. He is pretty strict with his four children. Sometimes he even beat them. But the children don't hate their daddy at all. And all of them finally went to Pecking University, one of the top universities in China. So Xiao proudly tells others about his education idea that children need strict rules. In his microblog, he said, \"Come on, want your children to enter Peking University without rules? You must be joking.\" And, \"Leave your children more money, and strict rules at the same time.\"But the \"Wolf Daddy\" way was soon questioned by other parents. Some say that Xiao Baiyou just want to be famous by doing so. The \"Wolf Daddy\" Xiao Baiyou is a 47-year-old Guangdong businessman who deals in luxury goods  in Hong Kong. Unlike many other parents who usually have one child, Xiao has four children. Two of them were born in Hong Kong and two in the US. Some people on the Internet think the reason why his children were able to enter Peking University is because the exam is much easier taken from Hong Kong."

      "The resignation letter of Gu Shaoqiang, a teacher from Henan, \"The world is so big; I want to see it.\" is very popular in the Internet. Many people say that it spoke the minds of millions of people who feel they have been in a boring and normal life and want to do something different to change it. Whatever the teacher may be able to achieve with her life, it is meaningful for people to make their dream come true.\nSo, what is your opinion? Should we praise the teacher for resigning and following her dreams?\nYes---All of us have dreams that can't come true right now.\nFirst, Too many people waste their lives by doing things they don't love simply because it is what people expect them to do. They are not happy and they also affect  people around them. The earlier they can break free, the more meaning they can make out of their lives.\nSecond, It is a waste of people's talents and social resources  if they don't get to do the things they are most talented at. Some people don't want to be white-collar workers all their lives. They should have the freedom to change their lives.\nThird, As our country develops so fast, people have greater freedom to change their lives as long as they put in the time and effort. The teacher is a good example.\nNo---People can't change their lives overnight.\nFirst, \"Seeing the world\" is not good enough an excuse to leave one's job and life. This kind of attitude could actually be a bad example for young people.\nSecond, Everyone has a place in society and life. People may not have achieved their wildest or most ambitious dreams, but where they end up is the result of their and society's decisions. Unless they offer to make lots of efforts and sacrifices, people can't change their lives _ \nThird, The reason why the teacher gave up her job is too unclear. It is too irresponsible."

Some people climbed the highest mountains; some traveled into unknown parts of the world; some sailed small boats across the largest sea. Now some people begin to look for new excitement.\nBungee jumping   and motorcycle racing   are quite dangerous sports. Bungee jumping only lasts for a few minutes or even seconds. You jump from a high place, about 200 meters above the ground, and there is a rubber band   tied to your legs. When you jump down, the rubber band pulls you up. About 2,000,000 people around the world have tried bungee jumping.\nWhy do people join in these dangerous sports? Some scientists say that it is because modern life has become safe and it is not interesting. In the past, people lived in danger. They had to go out and look for food, and life was like a fight but was interesting.\nMany people think that there is little excitement in life.

      "When you look up into the sky at night, have you ever felt that your eyes are playing tricks on   you? It seems that the stars are moving all the time.\nActually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)"

      "Sales of laptop computers passed desktops in the U.S. for the first time ever this fall, according to market-research firm IDC. That's bad news for backs, necks and shoulders.\nLaptops are bad for our body. When you work at a computer, the keyboard should be at elbow height and the monitor should be roughly at eye level, so you can sit well in a chair. But most users simply set their laptops on a desk or table. The keyboard is too high, which makes your arms reach up, your shoulders feel tired and your wrists bend down. The monitor is too low, which pulls your head and neck forward and down and your back may feel hurt.\nThat's OK if you use your laptop for a short time. But if you use one for hours without stopping - as do millions of college students, business travelers, telecommuters, video-gamers and growing numbers of office workers - your body may feel hurt. Ergonomics experts have warned about laptop problems for years. But people still like laptops better than the desktops. And they use laptops anywhere - in bed, on the floor - in all kinds of positions.\n\"How can a mouse or a keyboard hurt you?\" says Thomas Caffrey, the founder of Myofactors LLC, \"Wrong positions can be bad for your body.

      "Many years ago, I had my first chance to visit Russia. \"Russians are a very polite people,\" I had been told before my arrival. One of my friends explained that a gentleman will pour the lemonade for the ladies and show other good manners.\nToward the end of my three-week trip, I was invited by my Russian friend Nicolai Vasilevich and his wife Yulya out to dinner. At the end of a wonderful meal, Yulya asked if I would like a banana. I politely declined  and thanked her, and explained I was most satisfied with the meal. But my mind was racing: \"What should I do? Should I offer her a banana though they are as close to her as they are to me? What is the polite thing to do?\"\n\"Would you like a banana?\" I asked Yulya.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, but didn't try to take any of the three bananas in the fruit basket.\n\"Which one would you like?\" I asked again.\n\"That one,\" she pointed at one of the bananas. So thinking about Russian politeness, f picked the banana Yulya had pointed at. Then I _ it half way and handed it to her.Smiles on Yulya's and Nicolai's faces told me I had done the right thing. Alter this experience, I spent much time letting the world know that in Russia, the polite thing was to peel bananas for ladies.\nHowever, sometime during my third trip i learned I was wrong.\n\"Oh no, David,\" a Russian politely corrected me.  \"In Russia, when a man peels a banana for a lady, it means he has a romantic interest in her.\" How embarrassed   I felt.\nSo to communicate properly with people of different cultures, we should watch carefully how people of the same culture communicate with each other.

How are fruits different from vegetables and vegetables different from fruits?\" They talked for a long time and then they decided, \"We eat vegetables as part of a meal, but we eat fruits before or after a meal.\"\nIn real life, people do not think the dictionaries give the right meaning of a word. For example, the dictionaries say that tomatoes are fruits. But few people know that. Most people think they are vegetables. They call them vegetables and eat them as vegetables. To most people, fruits mean sweet things like apples, pears, oranges and watermelons.\nWhat are vegetables then? We call many plants and grasses vegetables.

Let me tell you some moving stories of great animal parents.\nSeveral years ago a heavy rain hit a town and made the river go up. When the rain stopped, people found that a dog swam to an island in the river twice a day for two weeks. Why did she do so? Her four children were there. The mother swam there every day to feed her babies. This true story moved many people.\nAnother story is about chimpanzees . A scientist named Jane Goodall spent 4 years living with chimpanzees in Africa. She found that chimpanzees also cared for those that were hurt or got lost. \"It is not only humans who have duties, animals also do,\" she said.\nTwo birds in Chengdu also showed their parental  love.

      "In America, there is a traditional story called a \"tall tale\". A tall tale is a story about a person who is larger than life. The descriptions in the story are exaggerated  , which makes the story funny. People who had lived in undeveloped areas in America first told tall tales. After a hard day's work, they would get together to tell each other funny stories. One character from these stories was Paul Bunyan, a hero who cut down trees in North America. Tradition says he cleared forests from the northeastern United States to the Pacific Ocean.\nIt is said that Paul Bunyan was born in the northeastern American state of Maine. His mother and father were shocked when they first saw the boy. When the boy was only a few weeks old, he weighed more than forty-five kilograms. As a child, Paul was always hungry. His parents needed ten cows to supply  milk for his meals. Before long, he ate fifty eggs and ten containers of potatoes every day. Young Paul grew so big that his parents did not know what to do with him. Once, Paul rolled over  so much in his sleep that he caused an earthquake. This angered people in the town where his parents lived. So the government told his mother and father they would have to move him somewhere else. Paul's parents had to take him into the woods where he grew up."

I hope you can understand  it.\nI love studying in London and I have many new friends. Most of them are my classmates. From Monday to Friday, we have English, math, physics and P. E. in the morning. I like English and physics, because they're interesting. I don't like math. It's too boring. At noon, I have to have lunch at school because my home is far from my school. We usually have two classes in the afternoon--art and politics. We finish our classes at 3:30 p. m. After school, my friends and I always play football on the playground. And then we go home by bus.\nOn weekends, we have no classes. We often go to the park and sometimes we go to the movies in the evening. We see movies twice a month. I like some famous  actors like Jackie Chan.\nOh, I have no time to write more. Please write back soon.\nBest wishes,\nWang Gang\n,."

      "As many as 10 of the 17 kinds of penguins may be in danger of disappearing. The number of penguins have decreased  by 30% since 1987.\nPenguins are black and white birds that live in the southern part of the world. They are common in South America,New Zealand,Australia and South Africa. Many live near cold waters. But some live near warm waters in Galapagos Islands. Penguins cannot fly,but they are fine swimmers. Penguins eat fish and krill .\nThe warming of the earth is the decrease in penguin populations. The heating of the air has caused ocean waters to become warmer. Higher water temperatures have reduced the supply of fish and krill. Some years later these birds are completely unable to reproduce .  Besides,many adult penguins die of hunger.\nWidespread  fishing,exploration for oil and oil leaks  also make penguins be in danger. Poisonous organisms  in ocean water are another danger. Penguins also have their enemies,including wild dogs,sharks,seals and sea lions.\nNews about penguins is not all bad,however. Several years ago,oil leaking from a ship hurt 40% of the penguins in South Africa. The penguins became covered with oil. But thousands of people helped clean and treat the birds well. Then they returned the penguins to the wild.  Now these South African penguins are reproducing in higher numbers than before the oil leaking."

Color your hair or eat black rice.\n\"Eat bird brains, pearls, and black rice?\" some people ask. \"How strange!\" But for many Chinese people, bird brains, pearls, and black rice are not strange things to eat. Instead, they are good medicines.\nFood that people use for medicines is called medical  food. The Chinese have eaten medicinal food and spices  for centuries. Ginger, for example, is a common spice in Chinese cooking. Ginger gives food a nice flavor. The Chinese began to use ginger many years ago. They used ginger not because it tasted good. They used ginger because it was medicinal. Ginger, they thought, was good for the digestion. It also helped people who had colds. Pepper and garlic, too, were probably medicines a long time ago.\nSome people don't believe that food and spices are good medicines. They want to buy their medicine in drugstores, not in supermarkets. Other people want to try medicinal food. They say, \"Maybe medicinal food can't help me. But it can't hurt me, either.\"\nPeople can try medicinal food at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, California. The restaurant serves medicinal food. The menus at the restaurant have a list of dinners. Next to each dinner there is information about the food. The information helps people order \"Queen's Secret,\" for example, is one dinner at the restaurant. This dinner has meat from chickens with black feathers. It is for women who want to look young."

      "Kites have a long history. They may date back  long time ago. They were made of bamboo and silk in China. Nobody knows exactly how or when a kite was first flown, but it is said that when a Chinese farmer tied a string  to his hat to keep it from blowing away in a strong wind, the first kite was born.\nChildren like playing with kites. Kites for work or play are made of wood, bamboo, paper, or silk. In 478 B.C., a Chinese philosopher , Mo Zi, spent three years making a kite out of light wood and bamboo. The earliest record of kite flying was in about 200 B.C. when the Chinese General  Han Xin of Han Dynasty flew a kite over the walls of a city. He wanted to know how far his army would have to travel.\nIn the 13thcentury, Marco Polo wrote about how the shipping businessmen flew the huge kite in the wind before the ship set sail. They predicted the voyage  in this way. If the kite went high and straight it meant a quick and successful voyage, but if it did not fly well, it was a bad omen . In the late 1500s, the kite was introduced to Europe by the Italians. Kite flying was first mentioned in England in a popular book in 1589."

I lived with my grandparents on a farm in Alabama. It wasn't unusual for me to go to the woods. And I enjoyed that. From the time I was 6 to 16 years old I was an actor. My mom asked me to audition\n  for a show in Birmingham. I asked my mom to buy me some video games and she promised  , so I got the part. Later, I became a professional actor. So for several years I went everywhere from the Alabama farm to many other cities -- all over the USA doing stage productions.\nReporter: How did you get into your field of work?\nDollar: I grew up on a farm and I was really a wild child and came to love wild things. I did a lot of photography in high school. I became a photographer and did photography for the local paper. Then I became a student of Duke University. Duke has a primate   centre -- Lemur Centre. I got a job there as a work study student and met lemurs there for the first time.\nLater I had a chance to go to Madagascar and decided to study lemurs.\nReporter: What's the one thing you can't travel without?\nDollar: A sense of humour   or a can-do attitude is necessary, but my first response   was soy sauce.

One day the feelings were told that the island would sink, so all built boats and left, except Love. Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out  until the last possible moment.\nWhen the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.\nRichness was passing by Love in a big boat. Love said, \"Richness, can you take me with you?\"\nRichness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.\"\nLove decided to ask Vanity  who was also passing by in a beautiful ship.\"Vanity, please help me!\"\n\"I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage  my boat, \"Vanity answered.\nSadness was close by so Love asked, \"Sadness, let me go with you.\"\n\"Oh...Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!\"\nHappiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.\nSuddenly, there was a voice, \"Come, Love, I will take you.\"It was an elder. So thankful and happy, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed  the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, \"Who helped me?\"\n\"It was Time, \"Knowledge answered.\n\"Time?\"asked Love.\"But why did Time help me?\"\nKnowledge smiled with deep wisdom  and answered, \"Because only Time is able to understand how valuable Love is.\""

Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit  ?\nIf you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant. The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk   said it was like a snake. The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear(  ) as he touched the animal's tusk. The fourth, who took hold of the elephant's tail, insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The last, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan.\nEach man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \"simple fact\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours.\nTo see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \"simple fact\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second. Put lukewarm water  in the third. Now put your left hand in the hot water. Put your right hand in the lukewarm water.

      "Once a traveller came into a village which was suffering from hunger. The villagers asked him to leave, for they feared he wanted them to give him food. They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone. Are you like one of the villagers? If you come forward and share your gifts, you will inspire others to do the same. The reward is a feast that can feed many."

      "Unlike Chinese people, the ones in the West believe in star signs. Western world has a complete system  of star signs, and they explain them and use them to tell a person's characteristics and the things they like or dislike. There are a cycle of 12 of them in all.

They seldom tell lies; in fact they're so open about everything, They have surprising intuitions  that they should pay attention to. They are pretty clever because they are so interested in everything. They can be a bit rude, that's only because they're very honest and will say exactly what they think. They love travelling, fast cars and horse riding. They also love spending money.\nMore about Sagittarius\nSagittarius are great friends because they are interested in everything and everyone. They are attracted by even the strangest people. With their humour, they are often in a good mood. They can be hurtful to others because they cannot stop speaking what they see as the truth, but they don't mean to. _ . Their values are spiritual  rather than material.\nThey are hard-working. They are very open-minded about new ideas and love to try ideas out. Usually it does end up working because they have an excellent intuition and can usually tell straight away if an idea is a good one or a bad one.

      "Which part of the world has the most nearsighted students? Just look around you-it's East Asia. _ school leavers in major East Asian cities are nearsighted, according to the BBC. Experts say books and video games are not to blame. East Asian students, they say, aren't getting enough sunlight.\nPeople become nearsighted because their eyeballs grow out of shape and light entering their eyes cannot focus correctly. The body can produce a chemical called dopamine   to stop eyeballs from changing shape. And guess what scientists have just discovered? Sunlight can help our bodies produce more dopamine, reported AFP.\nAccording to the study, primary school students in Singapore spend only 30 minutes outdoors every day; in Australia, by contrast, kids spend about three hours a day outside. As a result, fewer children in Australia are nearsighted-only 10 percent, compared with 90 percent in Singapore.\n\"Children in East Asia basically go to school... go home and stay inside. They study and they watch television,\" Ian Morgan of the Australian National University told AFP.\nBut being a bookworm or a couch potato does not directly harm the eyes, added Morgan. \"As long as they get outside, it doesn't seem to matter how much study they do,\" he explained. \"There are some kids who study hard and get outside and play hard and they are generally fine. The ones who are at major risk are the ones who study hard and don't get outside. As a result of massive   educational pressures and the construction   of a child's day, the amount of time they spend outside in bright light is minimized.\"\nExperts suggest children should stay outside for two to three hours every day. This can include time spent in the playground and walking to and from school."

      "Food is a major part of every culture. After all, everyone needs to eat! But each country has its own traditions on what people eat and when.\nEgypt\nEgyptians commonly start the day with a drink, sometimes going with bread. Breakfast can be eaten any time after this but before the day's main meal. In the past, this main meal was served at around 3:00 p.m. But now people work longer hours and eat when they get home at around 6:00 p.m. Dinner parties are held later, around 9:00 p.m.\nMost Egyptian meals include bread or ice, cooked vegetables and beans or meat.\nFrance\nFrance is known for its fine cooking, and its people take food seriously. Most eat three meals a day at fixed times and never snack between meals. Breakfast is a light meal of bread and coffee. They eat lunch at around 1:00 p.m. and a dinner with multiple courses after 8:00 p.m.\nThe French consider eating a social activity. Eating alone is hard to see, and eating while doing something else is unheard-of. The French take time to enjoy their meals and visitors should do the same.\nBrazil\nLike the French, Brazilians usually eat a light breakfast. Lunch, the largest meal of the day, usually consists of meat, rice, potatoes, beans and vegetables. Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., people enjoy a smaller meal with their families.\nBrazilians don't mind eating a hurried or light meal and sometimes buy food from street carts  . But they always finish eating before walking away.\nThe United States\nAmerican's ancestors came from many countries, so American eating habits differ. Some take time to prepare and eat a hot breakfast. Others take a bagel   while rushing out the door or just _ . For lunch, most Americans eat a sandwich or leftovers. Traditionally, families got together for a large evening meal around 6:00, but now busy schedules force many families to eat in turns. American restaurant servings tend to be huge. But you don't have to finish them; taking leftovers home is common."

      "Roosegaarde, an artist and designer from Dutch has thought of a device . He hopes it will make Beijing's sky clear again and help the people with masks breathe fresh air again in Beijing.\nAn electromagnetic field  will pull the dirty particles in the air to the ground, and then they can be easily cleaned.\nRoosegaarde says, \"It's like when you have a balloon which has static electricity  and your hair goes toward it. Smog happens the same way as the hair.\"\nHis workplace has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks.  Beijing's skies are regularly covered by grey smog. Serious cases of air pollution are often reported in Beijing. Roosegaarde says an indoor test has already shown it works well and he is confident of the results. With the help of a team of scientists and engineers, he is sure that the device can be worked outside.\n\"Beijing is a very good place to test the device because the smog in Beijing is quite low and there's not so much wind.\" says Roosegaarde. \"We'll be able to make the air pure but the most difficult thing is to remove the smog. As a result, you can see the sun again.\"\nRoosegaarde also reminds us that his aim is not only to give a plan to solve Beijing's dirty air pollution but also to make people pay attention to the environment problem. He adds, \"This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer to do with it is clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles. \" However, he hopes the project will make the citizens realize the differences between clean air and smog-filled air."

It's probably because you both have different personalities .\nPersonality is also about how people think, behave, and react   to everything around them from day to day.\nSo what makes people think and behave in certain ways?\nPart of the reason is that people are born like this. A baby gets its blood type, genes   and other physical things when it's still inside its mother. These things may help decide what the baby will be like.\nBut one's personality doesn't stop here. Family life, school learning and life experiences can also make you the person you are. This doesn't mean it's impossible to change your personality. You can always try to make yourself better. Don't get too worried about your shortcomings  . Just accept them. This is a good way to start making changes.\nIf you don't know how to make friends, find out why. Is it because you're too shy?

      "Hunan TV's new program,   Dad,Where Are We Going? has become very popular since last year. The show tells us that fathers should take part in their children's growing-up. In fact, this topic was always mentioned by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872). a famous official during the late Daoguang Period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).\nAlthough Zeng spent most of his time away from his family, his letters back home to his children and younger brothers have become famous. In these letters, there are many helpful suggestions on proper behavior . Many of his ways on child education are popular among today's Chinese parents, including reading classical books and so on. His child-raising methods are useful for today's busy fathers. Like Zeng, they also spend most of their time away from home.\nAccording to Zeng,  the purpose of education was to learn wisdom from books, rather than getting an official position. Children should know that the most important purpose of studies is to get more knowledge about nature and life.\n\"But now ,parents just want their children to be rich and powerful. \" Mr. Tang, a writer in China, said.\nSome teachers say that parents need to build a good relationship with their children. Parents shouldn't force  their children to realize their wishes.\nIn Zeng's letters, he asked his young children to do housework as part of their daily life, even though his children had many helpers.

      "There are about 80,000,000 mines*  under the ground in more . than 60 countries. It is difficult and dangerous to clear these rnines, About 50  people including many children were' killed 'or htirt each iay.  In 2003,  APOPO,  a Dutch research com pan y that uains the an imals, came up with the-idea of s\\ng rats to search for the mines.\nThe animal trainers 'found that a kind of rats from Africa were clever and had.a sharp*  sense of smell.  The rats were about 75 cm long and.weighed about l.35 kg, light enough to run across a minefield without setting off the mines.\nIn January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. \"The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  \"You have to be patient.

      "Many people think sports are just for winning and honor, but there is a lot more you can gain from (get out of) them. I have learned over the past years that sometimes when I lose, I get a lot more out of it than winning. Also, I find a lot of times in sports, people are getting too caught up in the game instead of just having fun. The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way.\nI greatly encourage you to be a part of the school sports. Even if you are not the best, you can still have fun. Sports give people a great and healthy way of spending an afternoon, instead of lying around playing video games or even getting into bad things. Sports also give us a sense of achievement. There isn't a better feeling than to have done something fun and productive for my day.\nI think that we all need sports to give us courage. If we try hard in sports, we usually do well. If we did the same in study, we would all be champions. Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it's just fun. Without sports, our lives would just be boring. So as you may be able to tell, sports are amazing!\nOur coaches not only teach us to play sports, but show class and good sportsmanship while playing them. It's never fun when you lose to have the competitor rub it in your face. That's why our coaches teach us to show class when we lose; also, when coaches _ , don't get down. They only want to see you improve and learn from what they say. When you do badly and they don't shout loudly is when you should start worrying because they are giving up on you.\nOverall, sports are great! They bring out the best and worst of a lot of us. However, we can' t let sports get too serious to where it brings down all the fun. So to have the most fun in sports, you just need try your best and not worry so much about the winning or losing."

      "One thing that British and Chinese cultures share is a love for fine tea. Today, when we think of western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china cups.\nAfternoon tea\nPeople believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English are only two main meals each day ----breakfast and a heavy dinner that would last several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o`clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important,  fine china cups and plates, and silver teapots, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in the modern Britain.\nWill you come for coffee?\nCoffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use the words \"Will you come for coffee?\" to mean \"Would you like to come to my home for a chat?\"Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a \"coffee\" party.\nCoffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange \nIn the 17thcentury London, coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to have started from these coffeehouses.\n,,."

      "There are several ways you can find out about the countries and places you wish to visit. You can talk to friends who have traveled to the places, you can go and see a colour film about them, or you can read a travel book.\nIt seems that there are three kinds of travel books. The first are those that give a personal, subjective  idea of travels which their writer has got himself. These books can be useful if the writers share their traveling experiences with others. The second kind are those books which give objective  information of things to be done and seen. If _ has written such a book about the facts of a place, then it is more useful. The third kind are those books which are called \"a guide\" to some place or other. If they are good, they will describe and explain the place in detail. Like the first kind , they can be interesting and exciting, but their main purpose is to help the reader plan his travel in the most practical way.\nWhatever kind of travel book you choose, you must make sure that the book does not describe everything as interesting, exciting or fantastic. You must also keep an open eyes on its date of publication  because travel is very practical matter and many things change quickly in the 21st century. Finally, you should make sure that it's easy to find the useful information for you travel."

As I was talking about how I was studying English, the foreigner seemed to be very surprised, gently shaking his head and saying \"You don't say!\"\nI was confused, and I thought, \"Perhaps this is not a right thing to talk about.\" Then I said to him, \"Well, shall we talk about the Great Wall? Have you ever visited it?\"\n\"Certainly! Everyone back home will laugh at me if I leave here without seeing it. The Great Wall is wonderful! \" \"Yes, it is one of the wonders in the world.

      "When people talk about air pollution, they usually think of smog, acid rain ,and other forms  of outdoor air pollution. But did you know that air pollution also is inside homes, offices, hotels and other buildings?Indoor air pollution is more serious. The air in your home can be 2 to 100 times  more polluted than the air outdoors!In fact, some American doctors say that 50% of illnesses have something to do with polluted indoor air. Indoor air pollution is bad for our health in many ways. Young children and the old often suffer  more from air pollution. People with health problems may also suffer more when the air is polluted. Indoor air pollution can be bad for people's eyes, nose and throat. Air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, can also lead to cancer, heart disease, and even bad for the brain!In the great London fog in 1952, 4,000 people died in a few days because of air pollution!It is said that half a million young kids and women die each year in India because of indoor air pollution!\nThere're many ways to reduce  indoor air pollution. Here are some of them and see if they can help you:\nIncrease outdoor air coming indoors and open your windows for 15 to 30 minutes each day.\nTurn off all the lights and fans when you don't need them.\nShare your room with others when the air conditioner is running.\nDon't smoke and try to stop your family members from smoking. People who smoke are going to have trouble breathing and even die someday. If you're smart, don't ever start.\nEnvironment-friendly products, such as water-based paints pollute less and work well."

We hope that you will both be able to come again next year. Perhaps you'll be able to stay longer next time you come. A week is not really long enough, is it? If your school has a five-week holiday next year, perhaps  you'll be able to stay with us for two or three weeks.\nWe have been back at school three weeks now. It feels like three months! I expect  that you are both working very hard now that you are in Grade One. I shall have to work hard next year when I am in Grade One. Tom and Ann won't be in Grade One until 2011.\nThey went for a picnic yesterday but I didn't go with them because I cut my foot and I couldn't walk very well. They went to an island and enjoyed themselves. Do you still remember the island? That's where all five of us spent the last day of our holiday.\nTom, Ann and I send our best wishes to Betty and you.

      "\"High tech\" and \"state of the art\" are two expressions that describe very modern technology. High tech is just a shorter way of saying high technology. And high technology describes any invention or system that uses the newest ideas or discoveries of science and engineering.\nWhat is high tech? A computer is high tech. So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's. Because of improvements in technology, people could buy many new kinds of products in American stores, such as home computers, microwave ovens  , etc. \"State of the art\" is something that is as modern as possible. It is a product that is based on the very latest ways and technology. Something that is \"state of the art\" is the newest possible design or product of a business or industry. A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow. The expression \"state of the art\" has become as common and popular as computers themselves. Now all kinds of products are said to be \"state of the art\"."

While(......) they were waiting for the cakes, they remembered that they didn't bring any money.\n\"Hey, we forgot to bring money to pay for our cakes,\" the big tortoise said.\n\"The little tortoise can go home and get it,\" the medium-sized tortoise said. \"He's the youngest, so he should be the one to go.\"\nThe little tortoise wasn't very happy, but he knew he shouldn't argue with his elders, so he said, \"All right, I'll go. But you must promise  not to eat my cake while I'm away.\"\nThe large tortoise and the medium-sized tortoise agreed, and the little tortoise left for home to get some money.\nA few days later, the big tortoise said to the medium-sized tortoise, \"Let's eat the little tortoise's cake. I'm hungry again.\"\n\"So am I,\" the medium-sized tortoise said, and reached for the cake.\nAs she did so, the little tortoise shouted from near the door of the restaurant, \"If you touch  my cake, I won't go and get the money!\"\n, ."

      "Are you an only-child in your family? Are you feeling alone at home? How are you dealing with it?\nZhang Luwen, 12, feels lucky to have a 4-year-old \"brother\". \"With him, I never feel lonely at home. He goes with me wherever I go,\" said the girl of Sichuan Province. But it is not easy to be a sister. Zhang has to help her parents bath her \"brother\" every week. This is because he is hairy -- he is a dog.\nAs the number of pet owners in China grows more and more, Chinese students have animal friends at home. Experts say that these small animals give these only-children lessons in love, care, teamwork and generosity.\nThis month, the first study on the influence of pets on the children came out. It is a survey of 402 Beijing primary school students. It shows that animal friends are good for children.\nChina had more than 90 million only-children by 2006, according to the government. \"In families of three, most children feel lonely. They don't have many chances to learn how to love and be responsible for others,\" said Zhou Xia in the study group. \"So having a pet can help with the problem.\"\nHowever, some students complain that their parents don't allow them to have pets. \"They are afraid a pet would stop me studying,\" said Chen Qi, of Chongqing.\nPerhaps he could learn from Qin Yixing, 13, of Beijing. \"I don't play with my dog until I have finished my homework. I made the promise to my mom and I must keep it,\" said the girl."

      "Foreign visitors are often puzzled   in Japan because most streets there don't have names. In Japan, people use _ in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, \"Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go pass a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.\"\nIn the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat  . In many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or lowa, for example, people will say, \"Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile.\"\nPeople in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map: the measure   distance by means of time, not miles. \"How far away is the post office?\" you ask. \"Oh,\" they answer, \"it's about five minutes from here.\" you say, \"Yes, but how many miles away is it?\" They don't know.\nPeople in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek will often say, \"Follow me.\" Then he'll lead you through the streets of the city to the post office.\nSometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happen in this situation? A New Yorker might say, \"sorry, I have no idea.\" But in Yucatan, Mexico, no one answer, \"I don't know.\" They think that it is impolite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get lost in Yucatan.\nOne thing will help you everywhere.

While we were there, we walked a lot. First, we went to see all the famous sites--Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, then we went shopping in Oxford Street.

I could hardly understand what she was trying to say.\n\"Your father's dead!\" she cried. \"I found him lying on the dinning room floor.\"\nSuddenly I was standing straight up beside my bed, holding the phone and sobbing .\nI was a thousand miles away. All I could think about was how many hours, minutes and seconds it would take me to jump on a plane and get there. I thought about my mother sitting there alone with my father, and I couldn't move fast enough.\nThe flight was long and painful. I had planned on going home to see my dad and mom in another month, and I cried aloud, thinking I was too late. Then I suddenly realized the incredible miracle of it all: I hadn't been late at all. Actually, everything had been right on time."

She simply hated the place: the heat was almost un-bearable, 125 degrees in the shade, the wind blew incessantly, and there was sand everywhere. Finally, in desperation   she wrote her parents in Ohio that she couldn't stand it another minute and was coming home.\nQuickly came the reply by airmail from her father----just two lines:\n\"Two men looked out from prison bars. One saw the mud, the other saw stars.\"\nThe daughter did some real thinking, not only with the intellect   but also with her heart. She decided to stick to her post.\nShe made friends with the natives, learned to love the country, and eventually wrote a book about it.\nThe desert hadn't changed, but her attitude had.

      "Every summer morning, I know I am going to my favourite place to volunteer and make a difference in someone's life just by being with him or her-----a summer school for children with autism . \nBy helping the kids read or do math, I am not only teaching important skills but also helping them feel like any other kid. There are many wrong ideas about autism. The kids I work with can think and feel. They need help only in certain areas.\nOf course, each kid is special. For example, some kids like to draw, and others like to sing.\nAt the school, the kids learn through about 20 activities. These activities can help them learn skills they will need later in life.\nThe very first day I volunteered, a boy came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder and said \"Hello.\" From then on, I knew I could make a difference.\nAnother boy loved to have me read books that can help him learn to read. Sometimes he could be encouraged to read a few words or sentences. Finally, one day during reading practice, he read nearly 220 words himself!\nSummer school is also a time for fun. Last summer, bagpipe players came to perform. Most of us had our hands over our ears because they were so loud. When they asked for a volunteer from the audience, one girl raise her hand as high as she could, got up on stage and even tried the bagpipes in front of everyone.\nThrough these experiences, I realize that the challenges these kids face do not stop them from doing many amazing things. I'm teaching them, but they are teaching me as well."

      "Paper is one of the most important products ever invented by man.\nThe invention of paper meant that more people could be educated because more books could be printed. Paper provided an important way to communicate with knowledge.\nPaper was first made in China about 2000 years ago. In Egypt and the West, paper was not very commonly used before the year 1400. Paper was not made in southern Europe until about the year 1100. After that, the forestry country of Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the United States became the most important in paper-making. Today Finland makes the best paper in the world. And it has the biggest paper industry in the world.\nWhen we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books, letters, envelopes, and writing paper. So paper plays an important role in our lives.\nPaper is very good for keeping you warm, Houses are often insulated with paper. You have perhaps seen homeless men sleep on a large number of newspapers. They are insulating themselves from the cold. In Finland, in winter it is sometimes 40 degrees below zero. The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. _"

      "The word, \"photography\", was first used in 1839. It comes from the Greek words that mean \"to write with light\". But photography could only give people _ pictures. So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\nBack in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\nAt that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\nThough is usually considered as the person who created the first movie in 1889, it was the work of Eadweard Muybridge and the bet that led to Edison's invention."

Of course, it'd still get a lot more power from one AA battery, though.\nMelhuish says his team is now working on a new and improved robot, called Ecobot III, which will have a better digestion system.\nIt seems that after an eight fly dinner, Ecobot II couldn't deal with the leftover  \"waste\".\nMaybe restrooms in the future will have signs for boys, girls, and robots."

      "When he was a teenager, Hunter Adam was very unhappy and he spent many years in a special hospital for people with mental health problems.\nWhen he left the hospital, Adam decided to become a doctor, so he went to a medical school in Virginia, USA. But when he was there, he did things in a different way. For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different.\nBut Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh\nWhen he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people.\nHunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:\"hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend. I enjoyed playing him.\""

      "Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\""

      "The Chinese tradition of giving gifts of money in red envelopes at Lunar New Year has turned into big business for Web giants Alibaba and Tencent, which now both offer electronic \"hong bao\".\nAt the end of each lunar year, it is common in China to give children hong bao -- some money in envelopes that are red, the colour of success. But now theold also take part in this activity.\nIt is now possible to exchange \"red envelopes\" with smartphone, which is popular in China and has caused a battle  for the _ market between the two companies providing the service, Tencent and Alibaba.\n\"You don't have to pay the same cost or wait as long as you would for a traditional bank transfer . It's more convenient, simple and fun,\" Wang Le, a 28-year-old Beijinger, told AFP. \" With electronic red envelopes, you're not limited by your identity  or the time of year. It's a new, fresh way of playing the game.\"\nThe idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system with over 400 million users and run[:**]by Tencent, China's largest Internet service system. It was successful at once.\nThis year, Alipay Wallet , the payment system run by Alibaba, is ready to take on the competition. It is allowing its 190 million users to send digital gifts, especially on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.\nFor the past few weeks a digital battle has been terrible, with Tencent banning  Alipay from sending red envelopes on WeChat, saying they were at a risk. Recently, WeChat also blocked  Alibaba's music app Xiami.\nTo attract the public's attention, the two companies have launched lotteries through which they award red envelopes to users in an online game.\nIt's easy to send and receive hong bao or take part in the lotteries: you simply need to register  your bank details.\nAccording to market research group iResearch, Alipay controls 82.6 percent of the Chinese mobile phone payment market, compared to 10 percent for Tencent's Tenpay."

      "Tiger Mom,\nYou've been criticized  a lot since your book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, came out. One problem is that some people don't get your humor. They think you're serious about all things and Lulu and I are suffering a lot from such a strict mother. That is not true.\nBut for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us dogs included squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix.\nI admit it: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd got away from. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did.\nA lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, I came to the opposite conclusion: your strict parenting made me more independent .\nEverybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you refused to take because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people believe that Lulu and I will feel hurt for life. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't put my heart into it. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel hurt at all.\nThere's one more thing: I have come to understand what it really means to live a meaningful life to the fullest. To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind. You feel _ when the piano piece you've practiced for days and hours finally comes to life beneath your fingertips. You feel _ when you do something on your own that you never thought you could. And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you.\nYours,\nSophia"

Children liked to see their lovely friend, because he brought happiness to them.\nMickey is a clean mouse right from the beginning. Maybe this is why people love Mickey Mouse very much. In his early life, Mickey did some wrong things. People were very angry. They wrote to Disney and said they didn't want Mickey to do the wrong things.

      "Having friends, and finding new friendships is an important developmental task for preteens and teens. While they have learned to play well with others during their childhood, developing independent friendships is a different thing. Preteens and teens will be allowed to use their own resources to decide whether to be someone's friend or not, instead of being taught by their parents. Parents must give their teenagers some freedom in choosing who they want to hang out with.\nYou can help your teens to choose their friends, although it's your teenagers who make the final decision. You can use teachable moments to talk about what makes a good friend. Here are some points to remember when you talk about friendships with your teenagers:\n1) You are allowed to have many friends;\n2) Honesty is important in a friendship;\n3) Friends sometimes hurt each other, but they can say sorry and forgive ;\n4) Friends can influence each other, sometimes they will help you but sometimes they will hurt you, too.\n5) Who you choose to be your friend is important, so choose wisely;\n6) It takes many learned skills to make and keep a friendship, and it also takes many skills to end a friendship;\n7) It is okay and even helpful to make friends with the opposite gender ;\n8) It takes time to make a good friend, but it is worth the effort;\n9) Spending time together will help you get to know your friends well and you will feel comfortable sharing feelings;\n10) A good friendship will make you feel good about yourself."

      "Train-spotting\nMany people around the world have seen Danny Boyle's movie Train spotting starring Ewan McGregor, but how many of us really know what train-spotting is all about? Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them. Each month, two million pages are visited on the website TrainWeb.org.\n340words"

      "Top student Lin Yijian had a problem recently. The 14-year-old boy from Xiamen used to get marks of over 110 points (out of 120 possible points) on his math tests. But during last semester's final exams, his math score was only 90 points.\nIt was a shock. \"I didn't know what happened,\" said Lin, who kept feeling nervous and frustrated about math during the following month.\nLike Lin, many of us have setbacks   in life. What would you do to deal with these setbacks? Would you just let them be and give up?\nLin chose to face his problem. His parents and teacher also gave him help. After some hard work he now gets marks between 100 and110 points on his math tests. Although he still isn't at his original   level, Lin doesn't panic anymore.\n\"Don't be scared by setbacks,\" he said. \"You will beat it.\"\nChen Xingzhu in Shenzhen also has a story to tell. The 15-year-old girl is not good at doing sit-ups  , which is necessary for the coming high school PE entrance exam. One has to do at least 35 sit-ups in a minute to pass the test. Most of Chen's classmates can do 40. However, Chen could only do 20.\nFeeling worried, Chen decided to do something. She did sit-ups for half an hour every day after school. Now, after a month, she can do 30 sit-ups a minute.\n\"I finally found what made me slow through continuous practice and then improved little by little,\" said Chen. \"I believe next month I will be able to do 40!\""

      "As kids, we learn how to write, maybe play a musical instrument and draw. So why don't we learn to code   computer programs too? What coding has in common with writing, playing music and creating art is that it lets you bring your ideas to life. Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\nStart early\nOne of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\nWant to leam more? Find out if there is a CoderDojo near you at www. coderdojo. com or set one up yourself! Also check out Code. org which has lots of fun drag-and-drop coding games."

      "Did you notice the number on the book in a library? That number is part of the system used by libraries to organize their collections of books. And it's used in many countries. The number on each book tells you exactly what kind of book it is. This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\nIn this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book. A book on the history of South Africa will have the number 968.\nAs you can see, it is a simple system to use as long as you understand what the numbers mean. With this system, the library can keep its books well organized, and people can easily find the book that they want."

      "First, welcome to West Lake! I am glad to serve all of you.\nToday you come here, you are sure to be attracted by its beauty. Hangzhou is famous for West Lake which is a famous fresh water lake, It lies in central Hangzhou, in Zhejiang Province of eastern China.\nTraditionally, there are ten best-known spots on the West Lake. They are called Ten Scenes of West Lake by Qianlong Emperor. The West Lake is divided by three causeways called Su Di, Bai Di, and Yanggong Di. First I want to tell you the history of Bai Di.\nIn the middle of the Tang Dynasty, Zhen yuan era(785-804), poet Bai Juyi came to Hangzhou as a governor(,). He realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but the old dyke had collapsed , the water of West Lake had dried out, and the local farmers suffered drought. He ordered the construction of a causeway of a stronger and taller dyke to solve the drought problem. The lives of local people improved over the following years. Then Bai Juyi had more free time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake. He visited West Lake almost every day. This causeway was later named after Bai Di in Bai Juyi's honor.\nNext is Su Di. Spring Dawn on the Su Causeway is considered as the first of ten scenes. It was built by Su Dongpo, the great poet, during the Noah Song Dynasty. It is very beautiful in spring."

      "Even though she's quite young, Drew Barrymore can be a Hollywood legend  . She was born on February 22, 1975, in California. Being from a family that produced great actors, she quickly found her way into the spotlight  .\nWhen she was 11 months old, she made her first advertisement  on TV. She made her first movie at the age of 2. Five years later, she acted Gertie in Steven Spielberg's famous film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial(1982).[:,However, it wasn't all roses and sunshine when Barrymore was growing up. Most kid stars in Hollywood can't become stars as adults. And once they're out of order, their lives are in the darkness, smoking and drinking. So does Drew Barrymore\nAs she was growing older, Barrymore started to realize that life is more meaningful than dangerous actions in the films. She started to build a career in 1997. She has made a series of successful films since then, including Charlie's Angels (2000) and 50 First Dates (2004).\n\"In my life, there is darkness and drama , and I have yet to explore some of that in my work life. I just want to challenge   myself and prove that I can do more.\"\nActually, anyone who's not familiar with her disordered childhood might find it hard to believe she's such a sweet person now. Like many of the characters she plays in her comedy, Drew is easy-going and laughs a lot. In 2007, she was on the cover of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People issue.\n\"Life is very interesting ... in the end, some of your greatest pains, become your greatest strengths ,\" Drew said."

Looking at the sea carefully, he saw that two kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.\nTwo 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, had rowed out in a boat to _ a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The boys were terrified and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.\nTim knew that it would soon be swallowed by the waves.\n\"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls. \"I'm trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\"\nTim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to shout to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\"\n\"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said.\nOnce they were in the water, Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces.\n\"Are we almost there?\" they asked again and again. \"Yes,\" Tim told them each time.\nAfter 30 minutes, they reached the pier.\n,."

On Honesty Day, anyone may ask you any question and you should give a true and honest answer. That means that you have knowledge of Honesty Day.\nM. Hirsh Goldberg wrote a book on telling lies. He said in his book that almost all person lie about 200 times a day.

      "It?s always hard to say goodbye to someone you love. In Washington DC, US, local   zoo-goers are sad about the news that their superstar panda Tai Shan is going to leave the National Zoo.\nAt a morning meeting on December 4, zoo director  Steven Montfort said that the black-eared bear would be going off to China sometime over the winter, under an agreement with the Chinese government.\nTai Shan, whose name means \"peaceful mountain,\" was born at the DC zoo on July 9, 2005. He has been loved by zoo-goers since his first public show in December of that year.\nBut under the agreement that brought his mother, Mei Xiang, and father, Tian Tian, to the zoo from China, all three belong to   China.\nTai Shan should have been returned to China when he was 2. But China gave him two extensions   to stay at the National Zoo. Tai is old enough to breed  . So it?s time for him to come back to China and join a program to try to increase the panda population.\nThe National Zoo has tried to breed Mei Xiang a few times since Tai Shan was born, without success. Montfort said the zoo would try again soon in the hope of producing another baby panda. \"We?re hopeful every year,\" he said."

Student editors  at a French newspaper for kids called \"Mon Quotidien\", do every day.\nThe 10-year-old newspaper has its headquarters   in Paris. Sometimes the newspaper sells 200,000 copies every day. It gets more than one million dollars every year! This is much more than other newspapers.\nHow do they decide what to put in the paper? All the adult editors working on the children's daily agree that the paper should be easy and simple to read. Kids should be able to finish it within 10 minutes.\nThe paper covers school life, animals, and science, which are usually kid's favourite subjects. It also talks about big world problem, like the Iraq   war.\nIn order to make the paper more popular with kids, adult editors invite students from age 10 to 15 to take part in their meetings. They have meetings every Wednesday and Sunday. Adult editors, reporters and kids sit together and decide which topics should come out in the paper and on which page.\nWhich topic should come out on the front page, European Union   or bears in the zoo? Often the kid editors and adult writers disagree. Sometimes, the adult editors have to give up because their little editors won't give in.\nUsually the student editors stay in the newspaper office for three hours at each meeting.

      "A young man woke up one morning under a bridge and checked his pocket. All he had left was less than ten dollars. He bought food and as he sat down to eat, an old man and two children came along. The old man asked him to help them with food as they had not eaten for almost a week.\nThe young man looked at the children---they were so weak that they could hardly stand. With the last bit of kindness he had he gave them all the food. The old man and children thanked the young man and then gave him a dirty old coin. The young man said, \"You need this coin more than I do--- just keep it.\" The old man insisted  that the young man put it in his pocket---and finally he did.\nThe old man and children sat down to eat. And with no money, no job and no food, the young man went back under the bridge to lie down. As he was about to fall asleep he saw an old newspaper on the ground. He picked it up and saw an ad inviting people with old coins to come to a store. He decided to go there with the dirty old coin the man gave him.\nWhen he arrived at the store, he gave the keeper the dirty old coin. The keeper cried loudly. It was part of a Spanish treasure ship that had never been found. This same old coin was worth 67,000 dollars. The young man was pleased.

      "Today, after many days of practice and lots of matches, we entered the basketball final.\nI was the leader of the team. At the very beginning, one student from our team got the ball and quickly shot a basket. Oh, it went in, 2:0. All our classmates cheered.\nBut after a few minutes there were some mistakes and we lost eight points. I changed two players, but it didn't help.\nAt that time all our teammates felt worried and we even quarreled with each other angrily.  \"It's no use crying over spilt milk!\" I shouted, \"We must face it !\" Let's think about our mistakes and stop making them!\"\nWe had a short meeting . The second half of the match began. There was a big change. At first, our team got the ball and I shot from the three-point line at once. The ball did a beautiful curve and went straight into the basket.\nI become very confident. The other team was still very strong.\nA good chance came! I got the ball again and shot into the basket! 12:9! I couldn't believe my eyes! Am I that good at shooting? How could I get so many points?\nWe stayed in the lead. Finally the score was 18:16. We won!"

      "I never wanted a dog, but now I'm so glad I have one. About two years ago, my wife, Cathy, got a little dog with a face only a mother could love. We named her Gertie.\nGertie is the kind of dog that has to grow on you. So I dicided that the dog would be trained. This didn't quite go as planned. At 15 weeks old, she was nearly made to leave the Petsmart Training School. She spent every night lying in our bed-snoring  so loudly that I hardly got a good night's sleep.\nThen, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing.\nMy wife and I both agree that it is Gertie who has changed my behaviour. Gertie is now nearly two years old and almost fully grown.I have come to like the pet little by little, though she is my wife's dog."

Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way.\nWhen someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong.\nIf a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents may be blamed , and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories ? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things, they cannot write them down in a small notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories, so their memory is the whole time being exercised.\nSo if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: practise remembering things in a way as other people do."

In some _ cases it might be right to follow the crowd  , but in most cases this can be one big mistake. Ninety-five percent of people never succeed because they are following the wrong group. Actually there are reasons why we shouldn't follow the crowd blindly.  According to a study, people tend to follow the crowd when they aren't sure about the direction they should take. This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what's right and what's wrong! This attracts more people to follow them and the result is that most people move in a certain direction even if it isn't right.\nA man who wants to be successful always hopes for others' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people, but the question this man never asks himself is: are all of those people successful? Of course not! If you want to follow a crowd, then follow a successful one. However, in real life you'll only find one successful person among hundreds of people, and that's why following the crowd makes no sense at all.\nMost people act without thinking wisely. If you always follow others because\nthey're greater than you in number, then sooner or later you'll discover that you're\nmaking decisions you might regret later.\nHowever, should we never follow the crowd?No. I'm not trying to say you should never follow the crowd, but instead I'm just asking you to think wisely before you take a decision.

Schools were few and not very good. They could not depend on them for education. They tried their best to learn something and never gave up till they became well-known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, \"I cannot make worthy men of you, but I can help you make men of yourselves.\"\nSome young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. If they see their weak points and change their ways, they can be successful. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as  they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on themselves."

We will take the night train north, stay in Beijing for two days, and then catch a bus to the Great Wall.\nWednesday, April 30th\nOur trip to the Great Wall was long and boring.

      "A person has been badly injured in a car accident. It is necessary to give him a transfusion   because he has lost much blood in the accident. However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.\nThere are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited   from parents.\nBecause the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient  . However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma   until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.\nThere is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities. Among the Europeans, about 42 percent are blood group A while 45 percent are blood group O. The rarest is blood group AB. However, some American Indian groups are nearly 100 percent blood group O."

Not quite old and weak, I felt I wanted something more than the usual hotel room with 24-hour room service.\nI decided this year to try something completely new and booked myself a private holiday home in Antigua. This was the best decision I had ever made, as there was plenty to do, plenty to see and lots of lovely restaurants to visit. There was a private swimming pool, and a cool, wide yard where I ate my breakfast most mornings.\nAntigua has to be one of the loveliest places on earth to spend a holiday. The bright blue sea and the endless blue around the beach areas proved to be an excellent place for me to spend the long afternoons.\nI had to hurry to do what I wanted to do before the holiday came to an end. I managed to visit the Sugar Mill and Shirley Heights on my last two days and yet found myself wondering whether I could extend for a few more days.\nI rented a boat and came home after a day's sailing, refreshed, looking forward to dinner. Everything is so pleasant on these beautiful islands, swept by the trade winds and warmed by the sun for so many summer months.

      "Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 and died in 1790.The philosopher and writer was one of the most important men in the early days of the United States. He believed strongly in the importance of hard work, and he himself worked hard all his life, from the time he left school at the age of ten.\n\"Poor Richard,\" a character Franklin created, summarized Franklin's ideas in short sayings . Many of Poor Richard's sayings are still remembered today. One of the most famous is \"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,\" from the essay \"The Way of Wealth.\"\nIn the same essay , Franklin talks about the danger of laziness and the value of ambitiousness .He asks what is accomplished by \"wishing and hoping for better times\". He says that we can make these times better if we try hard enough. People who spend all their time just hoping will die without food. They shouldn't expect everything to be easy, or as Poor Richard says, \"there are no gains without pains.\" Franklin also says that we should work today, not wait until tomorrow. \"One today is worth two tomorrows,\" says Poor Richard.\" Never leave that till tomorrow, which you can do today.\""

      "The widespread number of food scandals in  China is making many people pause before they put their chopsticks in their mouths.They are wondering if the food they are eating is clean,healthy and nutritious  or does it contain  something harmful that will cause disease?\nMost of the food we eat today is processed food .That means the foods we buy in stores and supermarkets,especially packaged foods,are prepared in factories.Chemicals are added to the foods in these factories to  make them look better,taste better and last longer on the shelf.The chemicals are supposed to be harmless and there are laws that regulate  which chemicals can and cannot be used.Unfortunately,some producers do not obey the laws.\nA producer of steamed buns in Zhejiang Province was recently discovered to be breaking the law.He was adding yellow dye and other banned chemicals to the buns.He was also taking old buns and using them to make new buns.Most of the buns were sold to schools and eaten by students...like you!\nWhy did he do it? Why did he break the law and endanger people's  health? The answer is simple:he wanted to make more money.It was a moral failing,and this is at the heart of the food scandals in China.Too many people focus on making money and not on the effects their actions can have on others."

      "I was 10 the year my cousin Marley's parents gave her a painful Christmas surprise: they were getting a divorce . My aunt went to California, but my uncle decided to get her back. There was one matter: where to put his young daughter. Luckily, my mother loved Marley, giving her more attention than her family ever did.\nOn that Christmas Eve, my cousin arrived on our doorstep carrying an old blue suitcase. Before she stepped inside, Marley said, \"It doesn't matter. When my parents come back, we'll have a bigger Christmas than this.\"\nLate on the night Marley arrived, my mom came into my room, her arms filled with packages.I knew they were my Christmas presents. \"I know how you love surprises but we have to decide which ones to give to Marley.\"\nMy mother carefully opened the gifts. Wow! I saw ice skates, red leather gloves and a dollhouse. The last present was the music box we'd asked the lady at the local store to take down and play for us over and over again.\n\"Which ones?\" my mother asked. \"She can have the ice skates,\" I said reluctantly . \"That's good,\" my mother said. She began to tape the packages up again. Then she stopped and asked, \"Are you sure about these?\" At that moment, I realized she expected more from me than I had already given. So I gave her the music box, too, and  _ . The next morning, Marley's eyes were resolute . She expected nothing and wanted us to know she didn't care. But when she saw her name on the biggest box, she couldn't hide her excitement. I thought my happiness would be cut in half. Instead it was doubled.\nOver the last 40 years, Marley and I have grown apart . But the love we felt for each other that day still remains.

      "Yang Nan, 17, was happy to move to her new home in a northern area of Beijing. She was told that her neighborhood used to be farmland planted with vegetables, corn and wheat. But looking at the new road, beautiful park and supermarkets, Yang couldn't see any sign that food was once grown there.\nYang is not alone. In recent years, many Chinese people have moved into new houses in country areas. Tall buildings have been built everywhere in the suburbs. The crops and fruit trees are no more. But these changes have caused problems too, warns Gan Zang chun, an official at the Ministry of Land and Resources  .\n\"Chinese cities are growing fast. This has made the area for farmland much smaller. This is really bad for the country's ability to grow food, not to mention the lives of farmers,\" said Gan last Monday.\nThe country needs farmland to grow food for the people of China. But the recent rise in house prices has made selling land a good business. A lot of land has been used to build new houses for sale.\nPollution, which makes land useless, is another reason for the big drop in China's farmland. About 2.67 million square kilometers of land in China have been polluted and turned into desert.\nThe government wants China to have at least 120 million hectares  of farmland. But there are only about 121.8 million hectares left. \"It will be really difficult to reach the goal,\" Gan said. He said that the government would fight illegal land use and stop farmland from becoming desert."

      "Happiness is for everyone. You don't need to worry about people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads in their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you are studying hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of you; When you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; When you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. All your happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you should not always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving  door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.\n,. (5,2,10)"

      "Rachel Carson was born in the USA on May,1907. Her mother, Maria Carson, had been a schoolteacher. She also loved nature. She showed Rachel the beauty of nature. She also taught Rachel a deep love for books. As a quiet child, Rachel liked to read and write stories. At a very early age, she decided she wanted to be a writer some day. Her story first appeared in a children's magazine when she was ten years old.\nHer first books, Under the Sea Wind came out in 1941. In 1948, Miss Carson began working on another book, The Sea Around Us. She always remembered carefully when she wrote. She collected information from more than one thousand places to write The Sea Around Us. When the book came out in 1951, it won the National Book Award. It was No. 1 on the best-seller list for more than a year. The Sea Around Us made Rachel Carson famous.\nRachel Carson's most famous book, Silent Spring came out in 1962. In this book, she pointed out that the use of some kinds of pesticides  like DDT would cause the number of birds to decline because it would kill them as well. Finally, in November 1969, the United Sates government decided that the use of DDT must stop in two years.\nRachel Carson has been regarded as a great environmentalist  and writer. She will be remembered by the world."

I think maybe some of them are afraid of facing the real world, and they have to look for fun from the Internet. Some feel lonely and want to make friends during growing vegetables on the Internet. Some have great fun _ others' vegetables because they needn't work on their farm.\nMost parents and teachers are worried about these young people and students. Students spend too much time playing the game. It's bad for their health and study."

      "Mo, the first Nobel winner in literature born and living in China, said he had trouble with the sudden publicity, which put a lot of pressure on him.\n\"I only hope to return to my writing desk as soon as possible, and I would also like to do well in society anonymously. \" Mo said. He was bothered by a large number of requests asking him to offer help that took advantage of his fame. \" I was upset the first several days after the prize announcement, but then I realized the prize is just like a mirror that reflects various attitudes about my winning, and more, reflects the real me,\" Mo said. \"I still consider myself an ordinary citizen who writes. And presenting quality works is my duty and best way of giving back to society. I'm no superstar,\" he emphasized  several times.\nMo believes Chinese literature has achieved much in the past thirty years, and the driving force behind that is not the prize. Writers' creations should not be driven by awards, or criticism, or readers' expectations. Mo said he misunderstood the standards of the academy's selection before he visited Stockholm  to receive the prize in December.\n\"I thought they were judging the authors' personality or political features, then I learned the sole standard of their selection is literature itself, which is also deeply based in the Swedish people's long-established practice of reading a large number of books,\" Mo said.\nDuring the forum, established Chinese and Australian writers discussed subjects as diverse as tradition and modernity, the local and the universe and cultural inclusiveness. And they will also read works to each other and the readers. The writers communication will further promote  Chinese writers to a global audience.\nAustralian Ambassador  to China Frances Adamson agreed. \"It's a milestone  of literary exchanges between the two countries, who are longtime friends,\" Adamson said."

      "Do you know why different animals or pests have their special colours? Colours in them seem to be mainly used to protect themselves.\nSome birds like eating locusts , but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colurs with the changes of the colours of crops .When crops are green, locusts look green .But as the harvest time comes, locusts change into the same brown colour as crops have .Some other pests whose colours are different from plants are easily found and eaten by others .So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night.\nIf you study the animals' life, you'll find the main use of colours is to protect themselves .Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests .They cannot be easily seen by hunters because their colours are much like the trees.\nColours are useful not only on the land , but also in the sea .A kind of fish in the sea can give out a kind of black liquid when the fish face danger. The liquid spreads over quickly, so they cannot be found by their enemies and can quickly swim away. That is why they can live safely though they are not strong at all."

One was a very rich banker,another owned one of the largest companies in the world,and the third owned many buildings in the center of New York.\nThe reporter was talking to them about being important. \"How do we know if someone is really important?\" the reporter asked the banker.\nThe banker thought for a few moments and then said, \"I think anybody who is invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States is really important. \"\nThe reporter then turned to the owner of the very large company. \"Do you agree with that?\" she asked.\nThe man shook his head, \"No. I think the President invites a lot of people to the White House. You'd only be important if while you were visiting the President, there was a telephone call from the president of another country,and the President of the US said he was too busy to answer it. \"\nThe reporter turned to the third man. \"Do you think so?\"\n\"No, I don't,\" he said. \"I don't think that makes the visitor important.

      "It takes a lot of skills and hard work to set a world record in pumpkin-carving . Steve Clarke, a sixth-grade teacher from Pennsylvania, is a famous carver . Clarke has set many world records for carving pumpkins quickly. When he competes, he must cut our two eyes, two eyebrows, a nose, a mouth, and two ears as fast as possible. But Clarke knows something else about pumpkin-carving. It's easier to get a record than to keep it.\nHe took the t _ in 2000 when he carved a pumpkin face in 74.8 seconds. That time was 19 seconds faster than what Jerry had set. From then on, Clarke broke his own records five times. In 2006, he set his best time in Florida. His winning time was 24.03 seconds!\nThe only problem is that someone finally beat that mark. On October 7, 2010, David set the new record with 20.1 seconds. Clarke was not able to break that record this year, but he has planned to break the record. After Halloween, he will go to local pumpkin farms to practise designs and new skills.\nClarke is popular because of his super pumpkin-carving skills. In 1999, he carved more than 30 pumpkins at the Halloween party for then vice-president Al Gore."

In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day long, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night.\nCrows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from  crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds.

      "Do you know the phrase \"Weibo Addicts\"  ? Do you write a Weibo? If you don't, you are \"out\"!\nWeibo means microblog. People may spend much time writing a blog, but it takes a little time to write a microblog. Why? Because every message on a microblog is less than 140 words.\nMicroblog started in the USA. It came to China in 2009 and it grows very fast. In 2011, the number of Chinese micro-bloggers grew to 300 million. People write microblogs for many reasons. For many microblog users, it is a great way of learning the freshest news, talking with friends and sharing different kinds of information, including news, everyday life, pictures, music, videos and so on.\nIt is easy and fast to send a message on a microblog. However, this can also bring problems and even panic  . For example, when the big earthquake and tsunami   hit Japan in March, 2011, messages like \"Salt can help people fight radiation  \" were hot on microblogs. Then a crazy buying of salt followed. Later people knew it was just a rumor  .\nIn a word, microblog plays a new part in the life of Chinese people."

      "Plants are very important living things. Life could not go on if there were no plants. This is because plants can make food from air, water and sunlight. Animals and man cannot make food from air, water and sunlight. Animals get their food by eating plants and other animals. Therefore animals and man need plants in order to live. This is why we find that there are so many plants around us.\nIf you look carefully at the plants around you, you will find that there are two kinds of plants: flowering plants and non-flowering  plants.\nFlowering plants can make seeds . The seeds are protected by the fruits. Some fruits have one seed, some have two, three or four, and some have many seeds. But a few fruits have no seeds at all. An example of a fruit without seeds is the banana fruit.\nMost non-flowering plants do not grow from seeds. They grow from spores . Spores are very, very small. Some spores are so small and light that they can float in the air. We may say that spores are quite the same as seeds. When these spores fall on wet and shady  places, they usually grow into new plants."

      "After my husband died, my world crashed around me. My six children were 10, nine, eight, six, three and 18 months, and I was overwhelmed with the responsibilities of earning a living, caring for the children and simply _ .\nI was fortunate to find a wonderful housekeeper to care for the children during the week, but from Friday nights to Monday mornings, the children and I were alone, and frankly I was uneasy. Every unusual noise or any late-night phone call filled me with fear. I felt incredibly alone.\nOne Friday evening I came home from work to find a big beautiful German shepherd  on our doorstep. It was obvious he wanted to make the house his home. The children took an instant liking to \"German\" and begged me to let him in. I agreed to let him sleep in the basement until the next day. That night I slept peacefully for the first time in many weeks.\nThe following morning we made phone calls and checked lost-and-found ads for German's owner, but with no results. Saturday night he was still with us.\nOn Sunday I had planned to take the children on a picnic. Since I thought it best to leave German behind in case his owner came by, we drove off without him. When we stopped to get gas at a local station, we were amazed to see German racing to the gas station after us. He stayed again Sunday night.\nMonday morning I let him out for a run while the children got ready for school. He didn't come back. We thought we'd never see him again. On Friday evening, German was back again. We took him in, and again he stayed until Monday morning, when our housekeeper arrived. It went like this for almost 10 months. We looked forward to his coming each Monday morning he left home.\nEach week, between German's visits, I grew a little braver, but every weekend I enjoyed his company. Then one Monday morning we patted his head and let him out for what turned out to be the last time. He never came back."

      "Hi, dear boys and girls! Do you know how to be a healthy kid? Here are some rules you should follow.\nFirst, eat different foods, especially fruit and vegetables. You may have a favourite food, but you'd better eat something different, if you eat different foods, you will probably get more nutrients  your body needs.\nSecond, drink water and milk as often as possible. When you're really thirsty, cold water is the No. 1 choice. Milk is a great drink that can give you more calcium your body needs to grow strong bones.\nThird, listen to your body. How do you feel when you are full? When you are eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Eating too much will not make you feel comfortable and make you fat.\nFourth, limit  screen times. Screen time is the time you watch TV, DVDs and videos, or using computers. It is good to take more exercise, such as basketball, bike riding and swimming. You can't watch TV for more than two hours a day.\nFifth, be active. One thing you'd like to do as a kid is to find out which activity you like best. Find ways to be active every day.\nFollow these rules and you can be a healthy kid.\n, , ."

The goal here is to limit CO2and other greenhouse gases, which are closely connected to the big problem of global-warming  .\nWAY 1: Bring your own cup to Starbucks. You'll get a 10-cent discount, and it's one less paper cup to end up in a dustbin. The store won't create more waste when they throw away a cup.\nWAY 2: Turn off your computer. If you don't do that, your PC is still using energy. Turning off a monitor   for 40 hours a week may only save $ 5 a month, but it reduces CO\nby 750 pounds.\nWAY 3: Reuse plastic bags. Instead of throwing away 100 billion plastic bags a year, try and get a second, third, or tenth use out of them. Better yet, next time you shop, try a reusable bag. Oil that is used for making just 14 plastic bags would run your car for one mile.\nWAY 4: Use recycled paper in the bathroom. Most of the toilet paper we use is made from trees found in forests. If every family replaced one roll of toilet paper with a recycled one, 424,000 trees would still be standing.\nWAY 5: Plant a tree. Adding green to your garden is beautiful and earth-pleasing.

      "Snack time is a part of the day for children of all ages. But new research suggests that kids snacking in big groups could be at risk for _ .\nScientists from American University looked at the eating behavior of 54 kids between the ages of 2 and 6. At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine. According to the study, the more children there are in a group, the more likely they are to eat more. Those in the larger group ate nearly 30 percent more than those in the smaller group, and they actually ate faster.\nSince this is the first such study in children, scientists are quick to point out the importance of encouraging healthy habits in kids as early as possible.\n\"If you know kids eat more in large groups, it seems perfect to use this information to keep snack groups small or use small tables,\" says Dr. Jana Klauer, an expert in New York.\nSmaller groups would allow for a quiet and more relaxing environment-a perfect chance to teach children about food, manners and how to know when they feel full. \"This would have an effect on kids' eating,\" adds Klauer. \"They would slow down and eat less.\""

Many people in Alberta have taken in people from Fort McMurray, letting them stay in their homes for free until the fire is put out.

Some musicians, such as Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle, are holding special concerts, with the money going to Fort McMurray people. And companies have been helping, as well. Beer-maker Labatt filled thousands of cans with water--instead of beer--and sent them to the people in Fort McMurray.\nThe fire is huge, spreading over more than 229,000 hectares  , but firefighters say they believe they are starting to get it under control--it is becoming smaller instead of spreading."

      "If you could see a movie of your life before you lived it, would you want to live it? Probably not. The excitement of living is that you don't know what's coming.\nSure, it's hard to see uncertainty in such active light when you're out of work, or when you feel like you're failing. But uncertainty is really another word for chance.\nWhen Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do. She took a job in consulting ,but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income by teaching students. Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school . Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted.\nShe worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there. Every new role we take on means another round of uncertainty. Instead of fearing it, you should find some ways to deal with uncertainty"

      "Animals do many different, amazing things to get through the winter. Some of them _ . They travel to other places where the weather is warmer or where they can find food.\nMany birds migrate in autumn. Because the trip can be dangerous, some travel in large groups. For example, geese  fly in noisy, \"V\"-shaped groups. Other kinds of birds fly alone.\nSome animals stay active in winter. They must change themselves as the weather changes. Many change their doing or their bodies. For example, snowshoe rabbits grow white fur to help them hide in the snow.\nFood is hard to find in winter. Some animals, like mice, collect lots of food in autumn and store it to eat later. Some animals eat different kinds of food as the seasons change.\nSome animals hibernate for part or all of the winter. This is a special, very deep sleep. The animal's body temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. It uses very little energy. In autumn, these animals get ready for winter by eating much more food than in summer and storing it as body fat. They use this fat to keep them alive while hibernating.\nWater makes good protection for many animals. When the weather gets cold, they move to the bottom of lakes and rivers. There, frogs and many fish hide under rocks or fallen leaves. Cold water holds more oxygen than warm water, and frogs can breathe through their skin.\nEvery type of insect has its own life cycle and that is the way it grows and changes. Different insects spend the winter in different forms of their lives. Some insects also spend the winter without moving. Some insects spend the winter as pupae . Other insects die after laying eggs in autumn. The eggs change into new insects in spring and everything begins all over again."

      "At the age of sixteen, I went on my first volunteer program in West Virginia to repair or build homes for poor families. When we arrived, we discovered that the family we were going to help was living in a trailer that was in poor condition, no bigger than two parking spaces. A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\nWe soon decided that the only way was to build a new house. It was something unusual because normally our goal was to repair old homes. The family was pleased with their new house that was 20 by 30 feet with three bedrooms, a bath and a kitchen.\nOn Tuesday of that week, I asked the family's three boys, Josh, Eric and Ryan, \"What do you want for your new room?\" Kids in the families we had helped usually wanted toys or posters, so we were surprised when Josh, the oldest boy said, \"We just want beds.\" The boys had never slept in a bed. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\nOn Friday when we saw the truck coming, we told the family about the surprise. They were very excited.\nThat afternoon, while we were setting up the beds, Eric ran into the house to watch us with wide eyes. As Maggie, a member of our group, put one of the pillows on the bed, Eric asked, \"What is that?\"\n\"A pillow,\" she replied.\n\"What do you do with it?\" Eric went on asking.\n\"When you go to sleep, you put your head on it,\" Maggie answered softly. Tears came to our eyes as she handed Eric the pillow.\n\"Oh . . . that's soft,\" he said, holding it tightly.\nNow, when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems very urgent , my dad always asks, \"Do you have a pillow?\" We know exactly what he means."

      "What does it feel like to break a bone  ? It's different for everyone, but the pain is often sharp  . If the break is small, however, the person may not feel much pain at all. If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.\nTo treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.\nYour bones are excellent at healing themselves. Broken bones will produce many new cells   and tiny blood vessels  . These cover both ends of the broken part, and close up the break until the bone is as whole and strong as before."

You have put on the wrong shoes.\"\nThe farmer was very happy to hear that and said to himself, \"What a clever daughter I have got!\" Then he asked his daughter to go back and get the other pair of shoes for him.\nThe farmer had only two pairs of shoes.\nWhen the daughter ran back to the house, she found that the other pair was also a pair of wrong shoes.\nShe had to return to his father with nothing in her hands and said out of breath, \"It's no use changing them, Daddy!

      "People  usually  talk  about  two  groups  of  colours: warm  colours  and  cool  colours.  Scientists  think  that  there  are  also  two  kinds  of  people: people  who  prefer  warm  colours  and  people  who  prefer  cool  colours. The  warm  colours  are  red , orange  and  yellow.  Where  there  are  warm  colours  and  a  lot  of  lights , people  usually  want  to  be  active.  People  think  that  red , for  example , is  exciting .

However, students in a British grammar school really enjoy running on the corridor tiles   and their teachers even encourage them to do that.\nWhy? It is because the corridor was built with special kinetic   tiles. When students jump on the tiles, electricity will be produced. After one year, the electricity produced from the tiles can fully charge 853 mobile phones or power  an electric car to drive seven miles. It's amazing, isn't it?\nThe corridor tiles are really a brilliant invention. Students can not only play on the corridor, but also help power the lights in their school corridors and other equipment in their classrooms. Besides, this is a good way to teach students to be creative. They will be _ to be scientists, inventors and engineers in the future to find clean energy for all humans.\nThe inventor of the magic corridor tiles is Laurence Kemball-Cook. He was once a student in this school. Now, he is CEO of his own company. The corridor tiles are not Laurence's only invention.

      "One day in the eighth grade, I was taking a Math Test on basic trigonometry  . Now for a middle school student, there was nothing basic at all about it. So I had studied for about two hours the night before. After reviewing it for some time, I had started to understand it, so then I closed the book and  _ . However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test. Even though my dad gave me a hard time about it, it would have been a lot worse if he found out that I had given in and cheated."

Back experts  in the USA are worried about that young students are having back and neck problems because they are carrying too much in their backpacks .\n\"It hurts my back when I run,\" said Ebelin Reyes, a student in Virginia. \"It's hard to get up the stairs with my backpack because it's too heavy.\" Students have to carry heavy backpacks on their backs for a whole week's study. Ebelin is one of them. They have   regular backpacks with two straps  to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads  have _ rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, \"I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain.\"\nHow much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten  the load: less homework.\nDoctor's suggestions:\nLighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that day.\n(2) Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders  and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps.\n(3) The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back.\n(4) Bend  both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend over the waist ."

Or someone who does not usually like to go to the beach might say \"I visit the shore once in a moon.\" While many people use this phrase, not everyone knows the meaning behind it.\nThe first thing to know is that the moon itself is never really blue. This is just an expression. In fact, the phrase \"blue moon\" has to do with the shape of the moon, not the color.\nAs the moon travels around the earth, it appears to change shape. We associate names with certain shapes of the moon. For example, when we can see a small part of the moon, it is called a crescent moon. A crescent is a shape that looks like the tip of a fingernail. When we cannot see the moon at all, it is called a new moon. When we can see the whole moon, it is called a full moon. Usually, there is only one full moon every month. Sometimes, however, there will be two full moons in one month. When this happens, the second full moon is called a \"blue moon\".\nOver the next 20 years, there will only be 15 blue moons. As you can see, a blue moon is a very rare event. _ has led people to use the expression \"once in a blue moon\" to other very rare events in their lives."

There are more countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded . Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people ? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of living in a certain area.\nThe two main factors   that influence people's choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in . The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way , but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away. When it comes to climates, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people.\nNatural resources are tings that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creature. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers.

It also shows that they feel good about life, that they just want to be themselves and enjoy life, and that they are not afraid of problems.\nHip-hop dancing has a history of more than 20 years. It first began in the 1980s in the USA. In early times, in New York and Los Angles, many young black people often danced to the music in the streets. They used their legs, arms, heads and even shoulders to dance. Many young people still use most of these moves today.\nHip-hop dancing became popular all over the world because of the 1983 film Flashdance. Some people performed   Hip-hop dancing in the movie. People enjoyed their performance. They began to dance like them. Then it became popular. There are two kinds of Hip-hop dancing: new school and old school.

      "When you read an article you will understand and remember it better if you can work out how the writer has put the ideas together.Sometimes a writer puts ideas together by asking questions and then answering them.For example,if the article is about groundhogs ,the set of questions in the writer's head might be:\nWhat does a groundhog look like?\nWhere do groundhogs live?\nWhat do they eat?...\nIn the article,the author might answer those questions.\nSometimes an author writes out her questions in the article.These questions give you signals.They tell you what the author is going to write next.Often an author has a question in her head but she doesn't write it out for you.You have to work out her question for yourself.Here's a sample reading for you to practice this method.\nEarthworms\nDo you know how many kinds of earthworms there are?There are about 1800 kinds in the world! They can be brown,purple,green.They can be as small as 3 cm long and as large as 3 m long.\nThe best time to see earthworms is at night,especially a cool,damp night.That's when they come up from their burrows to hunt for food.Earthworms don't like to be in the sun.That's because they breathe through their skin,and they can't breathe if their skin gets too dry.Earthworms must come out of the earth if it rains a lot,because they can't breathe in their flooded burrows.What a dangerous life!\nEarthworms don't have eyes,so how can they tell when it's dark? They have special places on their skin that are sensitive to light.These spots tell whether it's light or dark.If you shine a flashlight on an earthworm at night,it will quickly disappear into the ground.\nEarthworms don't have ears either,but they can hear by feeling movements in the earth.If you want to hear like an earthworm,lie on the ground with your fingers in your ears.Then have a friend stamp his or her feet near you.This is how earthworms feel birds and people walking,and moles digging,near them.\nEarthworms are useful.Farmers and gardeners like having lots of earthworms in their land because the worms help to make better soil when they dig.That digging keeps the soil loose and airy .In one year earthworms can pile up as much as 23,000 kg of castings in an area about the size of a football field."
